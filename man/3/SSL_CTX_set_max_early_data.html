<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
are used to send and receive early data where TLSv1.3 has
been negotiated. Early data can be sent by the client
immediately after its initial ClientHello without having to
wait for the server to complete the handshake. Early data
can be sent if a session has previously been established
with the server or when establishing a new session using an
out-of-band <small>PSK,</small> and only when the server is
known to support it. Additionally these functions can be
used to send data from the server to the client when the
client has not yet completed the authentication stage of the
handshake.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Early data has
weaker security properties than other data sent over an
<small>SSL/TLS</small> connection. In particular the data
does not have forward secrecy. There are also additional
considerations around replay attacks (see &quot;
<small>REPLAY PROTECTION&quot;</small> below). For these
reasons extreme care should be exercised when using early
data. For specific details, consult the <small>TLS
1.3</small> specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a server
receives early data it may opt to immediately respond by
sending application data back to the client. Data sent by
the server at this stage is done before the full handshake
has been completed. Specifically the client&rsquo;s
authentication messages have not yet been received, i.e. the
client is unauthenticated at this point and care should be
taken when using this capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A server or
client can determine whether the full handshake has been
completed or not by calling
<b>SSL_is_init_finished</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the client
side, the function <b>SSL_SESSION_get_max_early_data()</b>
can be used to determine if a session established with a
server can be used to send early data. If the session cannot
be used then this function will return 0. Otherwise it will
return the maximum number of early data bytes that can be
sent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The function
<b>SSL_SESSION_set_max_early_data()</b> sets the maximum
number of early data bytes that can be sent for a session.
This would typically be used when creating a
<small>PSK</small> session file (see
<b>SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback</b>(3)). If using a
ticket based <small>PSK</small> then this is set
automatically to the value provided by the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A client uses
the function <b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> to send early
data. This function is similar to the <b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3)
function, but with the following differences. See
<b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3) for information on how to write bytes
to the underlying connection, and how to handle any errors
that may arise. This page describes the differences between
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> and
<b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When called by
a client, <b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> must be the first
<small>IO</small> function called on a new connection, i.e.
it must occur before any calls to <b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3),
<b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3), <b>SSL_connect</b>(3),
<b>SSL_do_handshake</b>(3) or other similar functions. It
may be called multiple times to stream data to the server,
but the total number of bytes written must not exceed the
value returned from <b>SSL_SESSION_get_max_early_data()</b>.
Once the initial <b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> call has
completed successfully the client may interleave calls to
<b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3) and <b>SSL_read</b>(3) with calls to
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> as required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> fails you should call
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) to determine the correct course of
action, as for <b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the client
no longer wishes to send any more early data then it should
complete the handshake by calling a function such as
<b>SSL_connect</b>(3) or <b>SSL_do_handshake</b>(3).
Alternatively you can call a standard write function such as
<b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3), which will transparently complete
the connection and write the requested data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A server may
choose to ignore early data that has been sent to it. Once
the connection has been completed you can determine whether
the server accepted or rejected the early data by calling
<b>SSL_get_early_data_status()</b>. This will return
<small>SSL_EARLY_DATA_ACCEPTED</small> if the data was
accepted, <small>SSL_EARLY_DATA_REJECTED</small> if it was
rejected or <small>SSL_EARLY_DATA_NOT_SENT</small> if no
early data was sent. This function may be called by either
the client or the server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A server uses
the <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> function to receive early
data on a connection for which early data has been enabled
using <b>SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data()</b> or
<b>SSL_set_max_early_data()</b>. As for
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b>, this must be the first
<small>IO</small> function called on a connection, i.e. it
must occur before any calls to <b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3),
<b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3), <b>SSL_accept</b>(3),
<b>SSL_do_handshake</b>(3), or other similar functions.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_read_early_data()</b>
is similar to <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3) with the following
differences. Refer to <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3) for full
details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_read_early_data()</b>
may return 3 possible values: <small><br>
SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_ERROR</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This indicates an
<small>IO</small> or some other error occurred. This should
be treated in the same way as a 0 return value from
<b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_SUCCESS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This indicates that early data
was successfully read. This should be treated in the same
way as a 1 return value from <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3). You
should continue to call <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> to read
more data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This indicates that no more
early data can be read. It may be returned on the first call
to <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> if the client has not sent
any early data, or if the early data was rejected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once the
initial <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> call has completed
successfully (i.e. it has returned
<small>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_SUCCESS</small> or
<small>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH</small> ) then the server
may choose to write data immediately to the unauthenticated
client using <b>SSL_write_early_data()</b>. If
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> returned
<small>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH</small> then in some
situations (e.g. if the client only supports TLSv1.2) the
handshake may have already been completed and calls to
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> are not allowed. Call
<b>SSL_is_init_finished</b>(3) to determine whether the
handshake has completed or not. If the handshake is still in
progress then the server may interleave calls to
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> with calls to
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> as required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Servers must
not call <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3), <b>SSL_read</b>(3),
<b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3) or <b>SSL_write</b>(3) until
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> has returned with
<small>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH.</small> Once it has done
so the connection to the client still needs to be completed.
Complete the connection by calling a function such as
<b>SSL_accept</b>(3) or <b>SSL_do_handshake</b>(3).
Alternatively you can call a standard read function such as
<b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3), which will transparently complete the
connection and read the requested data. Note that it is an
error to attempt to complete the connection before
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> has returned
<small>SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only servers
may call <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Calls to
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> may, in certain circumstances,
complete the connection immediately without further need to
call a function such as <b>SSL_accept</b>(3). This can
happen if the client is using a protocol version less than
TLSv1.3. Applications can test for this by calling
<b>SSL_is_init_finished</b>(3). Alternatively, applications
may choose to call <b>SSL_accept</b>(3) anyway. Such a call
will successfully return immediately with no further action
taken.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a session
is created between a server and a client the server will
specify the maximum amount of any early data that it will
accept on any future connection attempt. By default the
server does not accept early data; a server may indicate
support for early data by calling
<b>SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data()</b> or
<b>SSL_set_max_early_data()</b> to set it for the whole
<small>SSL_CTX</small> or an individual <small>SSL</small>
object respectively. The <b>max_early_data</b> parameter
specifies the maximum amount of early data in bytes that is
permitted to be sent on a single connection. Similarly the
<b>SSL_CTX_get_max_early_data()</b> and
<b>SSL_get_max_early_data()</b> functions can be used to
obtain the current maximum early data settings for the
<small>SSL_CTX</small> and <small>SSL</small> objects
respectively. Generally a server application will either use
both of <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> and
<b>SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data()</b> (or
<b>SSL_set_max_early_data()</b>), or neither of them, since
there is no practical benefit from using only one of them.
If the maximum early data setting for a server is nonzero
then replay protection is automatically enabled (see &quot;
<small>REPLAY PROTECTION&quot;</small> below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the server
rejects the early data sent by a client then it will skip
over the data that is sent. The maximum amount of received
early data that is skipped is controlled by the
recv_max_early_data setting. If a client sends more than
this then the connection will abort. This value can be set
by calling <b>SSL_CTX_set_recv_max_early_data()</b> or
<b>SSL_set_recv_max_early_data()</b>. The current value for
this setting can be obtained by calling
<b>SSL_CTX_get_recv_max_early_data()</b> or
<b>SSL_get_recv_max_early_data()</b>. The default value for
this setting is 16,384 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
recv_max_early_data value also has an impact on early data
that is accepted. The amount of data that is accepted will
always be the lower of the max_early_data for the session
and the recv_max_early_data setting for the server. If a
client sends more data than this then the connection will
abort.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The configured
value for max_early_data on a server may change over time as
required. However, clients may have tickets containing the
previously configured max_early_data value. The
recv_max_early_data should always be equal to or higher than
any recently configured max_early_data value in order to
avoid aborted connections. The recv_max_early_data should
never be set to less than the current configured
max_early_data value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some server
applications may wish to have more control over whether
early data is accepted or not, for example to mitigate
replay risks (see &quot; <small>REPLAY
PROTECTION&quot;</small> below) or to decline early_data
when the server is heavily loaded. The functions
<b>SSL_CTX_set_allow_early_data_cb()</b> and
<b>SSL_set_allow_early_data_cb()</b> set a callback which is
called at a point in the handshake immediately before a
decision is made to accept or reject early data. The
callback is provided with a pointer to the user data
argument that was provided when the callback was first set.
Returning 1 from the callback will allow early data and
returning 0 will reject it. Note that the OpenSSL library
may reject early data for other reasons in which case this
callback will not get called. Notably, the built-in replay
protection feature will still be used even if a callback is
present unless it has been explicitly disabled using the
<small>SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY</small> option. See &quot;
<small>REPLAY PROTECTION&quot;</small> below.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The whole
purpose of early data is to enable a client to start sending
data to the server before a full round trip of network
traffic has occurred. Application developers should ensure
they consider optimisation of the underlying
<small>TCP</small> socket to obtain a performant solution.
For example Nagle&rsquo;s algorithm is commonly used by
operating systems in an attempt to avoid lots of small
<small>TCP</small> packets. In many scenarios this is
beneficial for performance, but it does not work well with
the early data solution as implemented in OpenSSL. In
Nagle&rsquo;s algorithm the <small>OS</small> will buffer
outgoing <small>TCP</small> data if a <small>TCP</small>
packet has already been sent which we have not yet received
an <small>ACK</small> for from the peer. The buffered data
will only be transmitted if enough data to fill an entire
<small>TCP</small> packet is accumulated, or if the
<small>ACK</small> is received from the peer. The initial
ClientHello will be sent in the first <small>TCP</small>
packet along with any data from the first call to
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b>. If the amount of data written
will exceed the size of a single <small>TCP</small> packet,
or if there are more calls to <b>SSL_write_early_data()</b>
then that additional data will be sent in subsequent
<small>TCP</small> packets which will be buffered by the
<small>OS</small> and not sent until an <small>ACK</small>
is received for the first packet containing the ClientHello.
This means the early data is not actually sent until a
complete round trip with the server has occurred which
defeats the objective of early data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In many
operating systems the <small>TCP_NODELAY</small> socket
option is available to disable Nagle&rsquo;s algorithm. If
an application opts to disable Nagle&rsquo;s algorithm
consideration should be given to turning it back on again
after the handshake is complete if appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In rare
circumstances, it may be possible for a client to have a
session that reports a max early data value greater than 0,
but where the server does not support this. For example,
this can occur if a server has had its configuration changed
to accept a lower max early data value such as by calling
<b>SSL_CTX_set_recv_max_early_data()</b>. Another example is
if a server used to support TLSv1.3 but was later downgraded
to TLSv1.2. Sending early data to such a server will cause
the connection to abort. Clients that encounter an aborted
connection while sending early data may want to retry the
connection without sending early data as this does not
happen automatically. A client will have to establish a new
transport layer connection to the server and attempt the
<small>SSL/TLS</small> connection again but without sending
early data. Note that it is inadvisable to retry with a
lower maximum protocol version.</p>

<h2>REPLAY PROTECTION
<a name="REPLAY PROTECTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When early data
is in use the <small>TLS</small> protocol provides no
security guarantees that the same early data was not
replayed across multiple connections. As a mitigation for
this issue OpenSSL automatically enables replay protection
if the server is configured with a nonzero max early data
value. With replay protection enabled sessions are forced to
be single use only. If a client attempts to reuse a session
ticket more than once, then the second and subsequent
attempts will fall back to a full handshake (and any early
data that was submitted will be ignored). Note that single
use tickets are enforced even if a client does not send any
early data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The replay
protection mechanism relies on the internal OpenSSL server
session cache (see
<b>SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode</b>(3)). When replay
protection is being used the server will operate as if the
<small>SSL_OP_NO_TICKET</small> option had been selected
(see <b>SSL_CTX_set_options</b>(3)). Sessions will be added
to the cache whenever a session ticket is issued. When a
client attempts to resume the session, OpenSSL will check
for its presence in the internal cache. If it exists then
the resumption is allowed and the session is removed from
the cache. If it does not exist then the resumption is not
allowed and a full handshake will occur.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that some
applications may maintain an external cache of sessions (see
<b>SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb</b>(3) and similar functions). It
is the application&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that any
sessions in the external cache are also populated in the
internal cache and that once removed from the internal cache
they are similarly removed from the external cache. Failing
to do this could result in an application becoming
vulnerable to replay attacks. Note that OpenSSL will lock
the internal cache while a session is removed but that lock
is not held when the remove session callback (see
<b>SSL_CTX_sess_set_remove_cb</b>(3)) is called. This could
result in a small amount of time where the session has been
removed from the internal cache but is still available in
the external cache. Applications should be designed with
this in mind in order to minimise the possibility of replay
attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The OpenSSL
replay protection does not apply to external Pre Shared Keys
(PSKs) (e.g. see
<b>SSL_CTX_set_psk_find_session_callback</b>(3)). Therefore,
extreme caution should be applied when combining external
PSKs with early data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
applications may mitigate the replay risks in other ways.
For those applications it is possible to turn off the
built-in replay protection feature using the
<b><small>SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY</small></b> option. See
<b>SSL_CTX_set_options</b>(3) for details. Applications can
also set a callback to make decisions about accepting early
data or not. See <b>SSL_CTX_set_allow_early_data_cb()</b>
above for details.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUES
