<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The functions
exported by this module deal with runtime handling of Perl
modules, which are normally handled at compile time. This
module avoids using any other modules, so that it can be
used in low-level infrastructure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The parts of
this module that work with module names apply the same
syntax that is used for barewords in Perl source. In
principle this syntax can vary between versions of Perl, and
this module applies the syntax of the Perl on which it is
running. In practice the usable syntax hasn&rsquo;t changed
yet. There&rsquo;s some intent for Unicode module names to
be supported in the future, but this hasn&rsquo;t yet
amounted to any consistent facility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The functions
of this module whose purpose is to load modules include
workarounds for three old Perl core bugs regarding
&quot;require&quot;. These workarounds are applied on any
Perl version where the bugs exist, except for a case where
one of the bugs cannot be adequately worked around in pure
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Module name
syntax</b> <br>
The usable module name syntax has not changed from Perl
5.000 up to Perl 5.19.8. The syntax is composed entirely of
<small>ASCII</small> characters. From Perl 5.6 onwards there
has been some attempt to allow the use of non-ASCII Unicode
characters in Perl source, but it was fundamentally broken
(like the entirety of Perl 5.6&rsquo;s Unicode handling) and
remained pretty much entirely unusable until it got some
attention in the Perl 5.15 series. Although Unicode is now
consistently accepted by the parser in some places, it
remains broken for module names. Furthermore, there has not
yet been any work on how to map Unicode module names into
filenames, so in that respect also Unicode module names are
unusable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The module name
syntax is, precisely: the string must consist of one or more
segments separated by &quot;::&quot;; each segment must
consist of one or more identifier characters (
<small>ASCII</small> alphanumerics plus &quot;_&quot;); the
first character of the string must not be a digit. Thus
&quot;&quot;IO::File&quot;&quot;,
&quot;&quot;warnings&quot;&quot;, and
&quot;&quot;foo::123::x_0&quot;&quot; are all valid module
names, whereas &quot;&quot;IO::&quot;&quot; and
&quot;&quot;1foo::bar&quot;&quot; are not. &quot;'&quot;
separators are not permitted by this module, though they
remain usable in Perl source, being translated to
&quot;::&quot; in the parser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Core bugs
worked around</b> <br>
The first bug worked around is core bug [perl #68590], which
causes lexical state in one file to leak into another that
is &quot;require&quot;d/&quot;use&quot;d from it. This bug
is present from Perl 5.6 up to Perl 5.10, and is fixed in
Perl 5.11.0. From Perl 5.9.4 up to Perl 5.10.0 no
satisfactory workaround is possible in pure Perl. The
workaround means that modules loaded via this module
don&rsquo;t suffer this pollution of their lexical state.
Modules loaded in other ways, or via this module on the Perl
versions where the pure Perl workaround is impossible,
remain vulnerable. The module Lexical::SealRequireHints
provides a complete workaround for this bug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second bug
worked around causes some kinds of failure in module
loading, principally compilation errors in the loaded
module, to be recorded in %INC as if they were successful,
so later attempts to load the same module immediately
indicate success. This bug is present up to Perl 5.8.9, and
is fixed in Perl 5.9.0. The workaround means that a
compilation error in a module loaded via this module
won&rsquo;t be cached as a success. Modules loaded in other
ways remain liable to produce bogus %INC entries, and if a
bogus entry exists then it will mislead this module if it is
used to re-attempt loading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third bug
worked around causes the wrong context to be seen at file
scope of a loaded module, if &quot;require&quot; is invoked
in a location that inherits context from a higher scope.
This bug is present up to Perl 5.11.2, and is fixed in Perl
5.11.3. The workaround means that a module loaded via this
module will always see the correct context. Modules loaded
in other ways remain vulnerable.</p>

<h2>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
<a name="REGULAR EXPRESSIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These regular
expressions do not include any anchors, so to check whether
an entire string matches a syntax item you must supply the
anchors yourself. <br>
$module_name_rx</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Matches a valid Perl module
name in bareword syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$top_module_spec_rx</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Matches a module specification
for use with &quot;compose_module_name&quot;, where no
prefix is being used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$sub_module_spec_rx</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Matches a module specification
for use with &quot;compose_module_name&quot;, where a prefix
is being used.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Basic module
handling</b> <br>
is_module_name( <small>ARG</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns a truth value
indicating whether <i><small>ARG</small></i> is a plain
string satisfying Perl module name syntax as described for
&quot;$module_name_rx&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">is_valid_module_name(
<small>ARG</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Deprecated alias for
&quot;is_module_name&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">check_module_name(
<small>ARG</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Check whether
<i><small>ARG</small></i> is a plain string satisfying Perl
module name syntax as described for
&quot;$module_name_rx&quot;. Return normally if it is, or
&quot;die&quot; if it is not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">module_notional_filename(
<small>NAME</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generates a notional relative
filename for a module, which is used in some Perl core
interfaces. The <i><small>NAME</small></i> is a string,
which should be a valid module name (one or more
&quot;::&quot;&minus;separated segments). If it is not a
valid name, the function &quot;die&quot;s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The notional
filename for the named module is generated and returned.
This filename is always in Unix style, with &quot;/&quot;
directory separators and a &quot;.pm&quot; suffix. This kind
of filename can be used as an argument to
&quot;require&quot;, and is the key that appears in %INC to
identify a module, regardless of actual local filename
syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">require_module(
<small>NAME</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is essentially the
bareword form of &quot;require&quot;, in runtime form. The
<i><small>NAME</small></i> is a string, which should be a
valid module name (one or more
&quot;::&quot;&minus;separated segments). If it is not a
valid name, the function &quot;die&quot;s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The module
specified by <i><small>NAME</small></i> is loaded, if it
hasn&rsquo;t been already, in the manner of the bareword
form of &quot;require&quot;. That means that a search
through @INC is performed, and a byte-compiled form of the
module will be used if available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The return
value is as for &quot;require&quot;. That is, it is the
value returned by the module itself if the module is loaded
anew, or 1 if the module was already loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Structured
module use</b> <br>
use_module(NAME[, <small>VERSION</small> ])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is essentially
&quot;use&quot; in runtime form, but without the importing
feature (which is fundamentally a compile-time thing). The
<i><small>NAME</small></i> is handled just like in
&quot;require_module&quot; above: it must be a module name,
and the named module is loaded as if by the bareword form of
&quot;require&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<i><small>VERSION</small></i> is specified, the
&quot;VERSION&quot; method of the loaded module is called
with the specified <i><small>VERSION</small></i> as an
argument. This normally serves to ensure that the version
loaded is at least the version required. This is the same
functionality provided by the <i><small>VERSION</small></i>
parameter of &quot;use&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On success, the
name of the module is returned. This is unlike
&quot;require_module&quot;, and is done so that the entire
call to &quot;use_module&quot; can be used as a class name
to call a constructor, as in the example in the
synopsis.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">use_package_optimistically(NAME[,
<small>VERSION</small> ])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is an analogue of
&quot;use_module&quot; for the situation where there is
uncertainty as to whether a package/class is defined in its
own module or by some other means. It attempts to arrange
for the named package to be available, either by loading a
module or by doing nothing and hoping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">An attempt is
made to load the named module (as if by the bareword form of
&quot;require&quot;). If the module cannot be found then it
is assumed that the package was actually already loaded by
other means, and no error is signalled. That&rsquo;s the
optimistic bit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Warning:</i>
this optional module loading is liable to cause unreliable
behaviour, including security problems. It interacts
especially badly with having &quot;.&quot; in @INC, which
was the default state of affairs in Perls prior to 5.25.11.
If a package is actually defined by some means other than a
module, then applying this function to it causes a spurious
attempt to load a module that is expected to be
non-existent. If a module actually exists under that name
then it will be unintentionally loaded. If &quot;.&quot; is
in @INC and this code is ever run with the current directory
being one writable by a malicious user (such as
<i>/tmp</i>), then the malicious user can easily cause the
victim to run arbitrary code, by creating a module file
under the predictable spuriously-loaded name in the writable
directory. Generally, optional module loading should be
avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is mostly
the same operation that is performed by the base pragma to
ensure that the specified base classes are available. The
behaviour of base was simplified in version 2.18, and later
improved in version 2.20, and on both occasions this
function changed to match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a
<i><small>VERSION</small></i> is specified, the
&quot;VERSION&quot; method of the loaded package is called
with the specified <i><small>VERSION</small></i> as an
argument. This normally serves to ensure that the version
loaded is at least the version required. On success, the
name of the package is returned. These aspects of the
function work just like &quot;use_module&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Module name
composition</b> <br>
is_module_spec( <small>PREFIX, SPEC</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns a truth value
indicating whether <i><small>SPEC</small></i> is valid input
for &quot;compose_module_name&quot;. See below for what that
entails. Whether a <i><small>PREFIX</small></i> is supplied
affects the validity of <i><small>SPEC</small></i> , but the
exact value of the prefix is unimportant, so this function
treats <i><small>PREFIX</small></i> as a truth value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">is_valid_module_spec(
<small>PREFIX, SPEC</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Deprecated alias for
&quot;is_module_spec&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">check_module_spec(
<small>PREFIX, SPEC</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Check whether
<i><small>SPEC</small></i> is valid input for
&quot;compose_module_name&quot;. Return normally if it is,
or &quot;die&quot; if it is not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">compose_module_name(
<small>PREFIX, SPEC</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This function is intended to
make it more convenient for a user to specify a Perl module
name at runtime. Users have greater need for abbreviations
and context-sensitivity than programmers, and Perl module
names get a little unwieldy. <i><small>SPEC</small></i> is
what the user specifies, and this function translates it
into a module name in standard form, which it returns.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>SPEC</small></i>
has syntax approximately that of a standard module name: it
should consist of one or more name segments, each of which
consists of one or more identifier characters. However,
&quot;/&quot; is permitted as a separator, in addition to
the standard &quot;::&quot;. The two separators are entirely
interchangeable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
if <i><small>PREFIX</small></i> is not &quot;undef&quot;
then it must be a module name in standard form, and it is
prefixed to the user-specified name. The user can inhibit
the prefix addition by starting <i><small>SPEC</small></i>
with a separator (either &quot;/&quot; or
&quot;::&quot;).</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Perl
versions 5.7.2 to 5.8.8, if &quot;require&quot; is
overridden by the &quot;CORE::GLOBAL&quot; mechanism, it is
likely to break the heuristics used by
&quot;use_package_optimistically&quot;, making it signal an
error for a missing module rather than assume that it was
already loaded. From Perl 5.8.9 onwards, and on 5.7.1 and
earlier, this module can avoid being confused by such an
override. On the affected versions, a &quot;require&quot;
override might be installed by Lexical::SealRequireHints, if
something requires its bugfix but for some reason its
<small>XS</small> implementation isn&rsquo;t available.</p>
