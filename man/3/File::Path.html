<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
provides a convenient way to create directories of arbitrary
depth and to delete an entire directory subtree from the
filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
functions are provided: <br>
make_path( $dir1, $dir2, .... ) <br>
make_path( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;make_path&quot;
function creates the given directories if they don&rsquo;t
exist before, much like the Unix command &quot;mkdir
&minus;p&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
accepts a list of directories to be created. Its behaviour
may be tuned by an optional hashref appearing as the last
parameter on the call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
returns the list of directories actually created during the
call; in scalar context the number of directories
created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
keys are recognised in the option hash: <br>
mode =&gt; $num</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The numeric permissions mode to
apply to each created directory (defaults to 0777), to be
modified by the current &quot;umask&quot;. If the directory
already exists (and thus does not need to be created), the
permissions will not be modified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;mask&quot;
is recognised as an alias for this parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">chmod =&gt; $num</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Takes a numeric mode to apply
to each created directory (not modified by the current
&quot;umask&quot;). If the directory already exists (and
thus does not need to be created), the permissions will not
be modified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">verbose =&gt; $bool</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, will cause
&quot;make_path&quot; to print the name of each directory as
it is created. By default nothing is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">error =&gt; \$err</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, it should be a
reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made to reference
an array, which will be used to store any errors that are
encountered. See the &quot; <small>ERROR
HANDLING&quot;</small> section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If this
parameter is not used, certain error conditions may raise a
fatal error that will cause the program to halt, unless
trapped in an &quot;eval&quot; block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">owner =&gt; $owner <br>
user =&gt; $owner <br>
uid =&gt; $owner</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, will cause any
created directory to be owned by $owner. If the value is
numeric, it will be interpreted as a uid; otherwise a
username is assumed. An error will be issued if the username
cannot be mapped to a uid, the uid does not exist or the
process lacks the privileges to change ownership.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Ownership of
directories that already exist will not be changed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;user&quot;
and &quot;uid&quot; are aliases of &quot;owner&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">group =&gt; $group</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, will cause any
created directory to be owned by the group $group. If the
value is numeric, it will be interpreted as a gid; otherwise
a group name is assumed. An error will be issued if the
group name cannot be mapped to a gid, the gid does not exist
or the process lacks the privileges to change group
ownership.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Group ownership
of directories that already exist will not be changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">make_path
'/var/tmp/webcache', {owner=&gt;'nobody',
group=&gt;'nogroup'};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mkpath( $dir ) <br>
mkpath( $dir, $verbose, $mode ) <br>
mkpath( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $mode ) <br>
mkpath( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;mkpath()&quot;
function provide the legacy interface of
&quot;make_path()&quot; with a different interpretation of
the arguments passed. The behaviour and return value of the
function is otherwise identical to
&quot;make_path()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, ....
) <br>
remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;remove_tree&quot;
function deletes the given directories and any files and
subdirectories they might contain, much like the Unix
command &quot;rm &minus;rf&quot; or the Windows commands
&quot;rmdir /s&quot; and &quot;rd /s&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
accepts a list of directories to be removed. (In point of
fact, it will also accept filesystem entries which are not
directories, such as regular files and symlinks. But, as its
name suggests, its intent is to remove trees rather than
individual files.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;remove_tree()&quot;&rsquo;s
behaviour may be tuned by an optional hashref appearing as
the last parameter on the call. If an empty string is passed
to &quot;remove_tree&quot;, an error will occur.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE:</small></b>
For security reasons, we strongly advise use of the
hashref-as-final-argument syntax -- specifically, with a
setting of the &quot;safe&quot; element to a true value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">remove_tree(
$dir1, $dir2, ...., <br>
{ <br>
safe =&gt; 1, <br>
... # other key&minus;value pairs <br>
}, <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
returns the number of files successfully deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
keys are recognised in the option hash: <br>
verbose =&gt; $bool</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, will cause
&quot;remove_tree&quot; to print the name of each file as it
is unlinked. By default nothing is printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">safe =&gt; $bool</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">When set to a true value, will
cause &quot;remove_tree&quot; to skip the files for which
the process lacks the required privileges needed to delete
files, such as delete privileges on <small>VMS.</small> In
other words, the code will make no attempt to alter file
permissions. Thus, if the process is interrupted, no
filesystem object will be left in a more permissive
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">keep_root =&gt; $bool</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">When set to a true value, will
cause all files and subdirectories to be removed, except the
initially specified directories. This comes in handy when
cleaning out an application&rsquo;s scratch directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">remove_tree(
'/tmp', {keep_root =&gt; 1} );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">result =&gt; \$res</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, it should be a
reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made to reference
an array, which will be used to store all files and
directories unlinked during the call. If nothing is
unlinked, the array will be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">remove_tree(
'/tmp', {result =&gt; \my $list} ); <br>
print &quot;unlinked $_\n&quot; for @$list;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
useful alternative to the &quot;verbose&quot; key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">error =&gt; \$err</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">If present, it should be a
reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made to reference
an array, which will be used to store any errors that are
encountered. See the &quot; <small>ERROR
HANDLING&quot;</small> section for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Removing things
is a much more dangerous proposition than creating things.
As such, there are certain conditions that
&quot;remove_tree&quot; may encounter that are so dangerous
that the only sane action left is to kill the program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Use
&quot;error&quot; to trap all that is reasonable (problems
with permissions and the like), and let it die if things get
out of hand. This is the safest course of action.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">rmtree( $dir ) <br>
rmtree( $dir, $verbose, $safe ) <br>
rmtree( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $safe ) <br>
rmtree( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;rmtree()&quot;
function provide the legacy interface of
&quot;remove_tree()&quot; with a different interpretation of
the arguments passed. The behaviour and return value of the
function is otherwise identical to
&quot;remove_tree()&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE:</small></b>
For security reasons, we strongly advise use of the
hashref-as-final-argument syntax, specifically with a
setting of the &quot;safe&quot; element to a true value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">rmtree( $dir1,
$dir2, ...., <br>
{ <br>
safe =&gt; 1, <br>
... # other key&minus;value pairs <br>
}, <br>
);</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>ERROR
HANDLING <br>
NOTE:</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The following error handling
mechanism is consistent throughout all code paths
<small>EXCEPT</small> in cases where the <small>ROOT</small>
node is nonexistent. In version 2.11 the maintainers
attempted to rectify this inconsistency but too many
downstream modules encountered problems. In such case, if
you require root node evaluation or error checking prior to
calling &quot;make_path&quot; or &quot;remove_tree&quot;,
you should take additional precautions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;make_path&quot; or &quot;remove_tree&quot; encounters
an error, a diagnostic message will be printed to
&quot;STDERR&quot; via &quot;carp&quot; (for non-fatal
errors) or via &quot;croak&quot; (for fatal errors).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If this
behaviour is not desirable, the &quot;error&quot; attribute
may be used to hold a reference to a variable, which will be
used to store the diagnostics. The variable is made a
reference to an array of hash references. Each hash contain
a single key/value pair where the key is the name of the
file, and the value is the error message (including the
contents of $! when appropriate). If a general error is
encountered the diagnostic key will be empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An example
usage looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">remove_tree(
'foo/bar', 'bar/rat', {error =&gt; \my $err} ); <br>
if ($err &amp;&amp; @$err) { <br>
for my $diag (@$err) { <br>
my ($file, $message) = %$diag; <br>
if ($file eq '') { <br>
print &quot;general error: $message\n&quot;; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
print &quot;problem unlinking $file: $message\n&quot;; <br>
} <br>
} <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
print &quot;No error encountered\n&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if no
errors are encountered, $err will reference an empty array.
This means that $err will always end up <small>TRUE</small>
; so you need to test @$err to determine if errors
occurred.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTES</small></b>
<br>
&quot;File::Path&quot; blindly exports &quot;mkpath&quot;
and &quot;rmtree&quot; into the current namespace. These
days, this is considered bad style, but to change it now
would break too much code. Nonetheless, you are invited to
specify what it is you are expecting to use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use File::Path
'rmtree';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The routines
&quot;make_path&quot; and &quot;remove_tree&quot; are
<b>not</b> exported by default. You must specify which ones
you want to use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use File::Path
'remove_tree';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
side-effect of the above is that &quot;mkpath&quot; and
&quot;rmtree&quot; are no longer exported at all. This is
due to the way the &quot;Exporter&quot; module works. If you
are migrating a codebase to use the new interface, you will
have to list everything explicitly. But that&rsquo;s just
good practice anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use File::Path
qw(remove_tree rmtree);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>API
CHANGES</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>API</small> was changed in the 2.0 branch. For a
time, &quot;mkpath&quot; and &quot;rmtree&quot; tried,
unsuccessfully, to deal with the two different calling
mechanisms. This approach was considered a failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The new
semantics are now only available with &quot;make_path&quot;
and &quot;remove_tree&quot;. The old semantics are only
available through &quot;mkpath&quot; and &quot;rmtree&quot;.
Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to at least 2.08 in
order to avoid surprises.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>SECURITY
CONSIDERATIONS</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There were race
conditions in the 1.x implementations of File::Path&rsquo;s
&quot;rmtree&quot; function (although sometimes patched
depending on the <small>OS</small> distribution or
platform). The 2.0 version contains code to avoid the
problem mentioned in
<small>CVE&minus;2002&minus;0435.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
unless the &quot;safe&quot; parameter is set (or the third
parameter in the traditional interface is
<small>TRUE</small> ), should a &quot;remove_tree&quot; be
interrupted, files that were originally in read-only mode
may now have their permissions set to a read-write (or
&quot;delete <small>OK&quot;</small> ) mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In February
2017 the cPanel Security Team reported an additional
vulnerability in File-Path. The &quot;chmod()&quot; logic to
make directories traversable can be abused to set the mode
on an attacker-chosen file to an attacker-chosen value. This
is due to the time-of-check-to-time-of-use (
<small>TOCTTOU</small> ) race condition
(&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use&gt;)
between the &quot;stat()&quot; that decides the inode is a
directory and the &quot;chmod()&quot; that tries to make it
user-rwx. <small>CPAN</small> versions 2.13 and later
incorporate a patch provided by John Lightsey to address
this problem. This vulnerability has been reported as
<small>CVE&minus;2017&minus;6512.</small></p>

<h2>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
<a name="BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
describes <i>File::Path</i> limitations and how to report
bugs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>MULTITHREADED
APPLICATIONS</small></b> <i><br>
File::Path</i> &quot;rmtree&quot; and
&quot;remove_tree&quot; will not work with multithreaded
applications due to its use of &quot;chdir&quot;. At this
time, no warning or error is generated in this situation.
You will certainly encounter unexpected results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
implementation that surfaces this limitation will not be
changed. See the <i>File::Path::Tiny</i> module for
functionality similar to <i>File::Path</i> but which does
not &quot;chdir&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NFS</small>
Mount Points</b> <i><br>
File::Path</i> is not responsible for triggering the
automounts, mirror mounts, and the contents of network
mounted filesystems. If your <small>NFS</small>
implementation requires an action to be performed on the
filesystem in order for <i>File::Path</i> to perform
operations, it is strongly suggested you assure filesystem
availability by reading the root of the mounted
filesystem.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>REPORTING
BUGS</small></b> <br>
Please report all bugs on the <small>RT</small> queue,
either via the web interface:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=File&minus;Path&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or by
email:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bug&minus;File&minus;Path@rt.cpan.org</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In either case,
please <b>attach</b> patches to the bug report rather than
including them inline in the web post or the body of the
email.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
send pull requests to the Github repository:</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
<a name="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Paul Szabo
identified the race condition originally, and Brendan
O&rsquo;Dea wrote an implementation for Debian that
addressed the problem. That code was used as a basis for the
current code. Their efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Gisle Aas made
a number of improvements to the documentation for 2.07 and
his advice and assistance is also greatly appreciated.</p>
