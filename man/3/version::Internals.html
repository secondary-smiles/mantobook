<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">version::Internals
&minus; Perl extension for Version Objects</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Overloaded
version objects for all modern versions of Perl. This
documents the internal data representation and underlying
code for version.pm. See <i>version.pod</i> for daily usage.
This document is only useful for users interested in the
gory details.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS A VERSION?
<a name="WHAT IS A VERSION?"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
purposes of this module, a version &quot;number&quot; is a
sequence of positive integer values separated by one or more
decimal points and optionally a single underscore. This
corresponds to what Perl itself uses for a version, as well
as extending the &quot;version as number&quot; that is
discussed in the various editions of the Camel book.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
actually two distinct kinds of version objects: <br>
Decimal versions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any version which &quot;looks
like a number&quot;, see &quot;Decimal Versions&quot;. This
also includes versions with a single decimal point and a
single embedded underscore, see &quot;Alpha Versions&quot;,
even though these must be quoted to preserve the underscore
formatting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Dotted-Decimal versions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Also referred to as
&quot;Dotted-Integer&quot;, these contains more than one
decimal point and may have an optional embedded underscore,
see Dotted-Decimal Versions. This is what is commonly used
in most open source software as the &quot;external&quot;
version (the one used as part of the tag or tarfile name). A
leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; character is now required and will
warn if it missing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both of these
methods will produce similar version objects, in that the
default stringification will yield the version &quot;Normal
Form&quot; only if required:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$v =
version&minus;&gt;new(1.002); # 1.002, but compares like
1.2.0 <br>
$v = version&minus;&gt;new(1.002003); # 1.002003 <br>
$v2 = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v1.2.3&quot;); #
v1.2.3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In specific,
version numbers initialized as &quot;Decimal Versions&quot;
will stringify as they were originally created (i.e. the
same string that was passed to &quot;new()&quot;. Version
numbers initialized as &quot;Dotted-Decimal Versions&quot;
will be stringified as &quot;Normal Form&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Decimal
Versions</b> <br>
These correspond to historical versions of Perl itself prior
to 5.6.0, as well as all other modules which follow the
Camel rules for the $VERSION scalar. A Decimal version is
initialized with what looks like a floating point number.
Leading zeros <b>are</b> significant and trailing zeros are
implied so that a minimum of three places is maintained
between subversions. What this means is that any subversion
(digits to the right of the decimal place) that contains
less than three digits will have trailing zeros added to
make up the difference, but only for purposes of comparison
with other version objects. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># Prints
Equivalent to <br>
$v = version&minus;&gt;new( 1.2); # 1.2 v1.200.0 <br>
$v = version&minus;&gt;new( 1.02); # 1.02 v1.20.0 <br>
$v = version&minus;&gt;new( 1.002); # 1.002 v1.2.0 <br>
$v = version&minus;&gt;new( 1.0023); # 1.0023 v1.2.300 <br>
$v = version&minus;&gt;new( 1.00203); # 1.00203 v1.2.30 <br>
$v = version&minus;&gt;new( 1.002003); # 1.002003 v1.2.3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of the
preceding examples are true whether or not the input value
is quoted. The important feature is that the input value
contains only a single decimal. See also &quot;Alpha
Versions&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>IMPORTANT
NOTE:</small> As shown above, if your Decimal version
contains more than 3 significant digits after the decimal
place, it will be split on each multiple of 3, so 1.0003 is
equivalent to v1.0.300, due to the need to remain compatible
with Perl&rsquo;s own 5.005_03 == 5.5.30 interpretation. Any
trailing zeros are ignored for mathematical comparison
purposes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dotted-Decimal
Versions</b> <br>
These are the newest form of versions, and correspond to
Perl&rsquo;s own version style beginning with 5.6.0.
Starting with Perl 5.10.0, and most likely Perl 6, this is
likely to be the preferred form. This method normally
requires that the input parameter be quoted, although
Perl&rsquo;s after 5.8.1 can use v&minus;strings as a
special form of quoting, but this is highly discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike
&quot;Decimal Versions&quot;, Dotted-Decimal Versions have
more than a single decimal point, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># Prints <br>
$v = version&minus;&gt;new( &quot;v1.200&quot;); # v1.200.0
<br>
$v = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v1.20.0&quot;); # v1.20.0
<br>
$v = qv(&quot;v1.2.3&quot;); # v1.2.3 <br>
$v = qv(&quot;1.2.3&quot;); # v1.2.3 <br>
$v = qv(&quot;1.20&quot;); # v1.20.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
Dotted-Decimal Versions permit the greatest amount of
freedom to specify a version, whereas Decimal Versions
enforce a certain uniformity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just like
&quot;Decimal Versions&quot;, Dotted-Decimal Versions can be
used as &quot;Alpha Versions&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Alpha
Versions</b> <br>
For module authors using <small>CPAN,</small> the convention
has been to note unstable releases with an underscore in the
version string. (See <small>CPAN</small> .) version.pm
follows this convention and alpha releases will test as
being newer than the more recent stable release, and less
than the next stable release. Only the last element may be
separated by an underscore:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># Declaring
<br>
use version 0.77; our $VERSION =
version&minus;&gt;declare(&quot;v1.2_3&quot;); <br>
# Parsing <br>
$v1 = version&minus;&gt;parse(&quot;v1.2_3&quot;); <br>
$v1 = version&minus;&gt;parse(&quot;1.002_003&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
<b>must</b> quote the version when writing an alpha Decimal
version. The stringified form of Decimal versions will
always be the same string that was used to initialize the
version object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Regular
Expressions for Version Parsing</b> <br>
A formalized definition of the legal forms for version
strings is included in the &quot;version::regex&quot; class.
Primitives are included for common elements, although they
are scoped to the file so they are useful for reference
purposes only. There are two publicly accessible scalars
that can be used in other code (not exported): <br>
$version::LAX</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This regexp covers all of the
legal forms allowed under the current version string parser.
This is not to say that all of these forms are recommended,
and some of them can only be used when quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For dotted
decimals:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">v1.2 <br>
1.2345.6 <br>
v1.23_4</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; is optional if two or more decimals appear.
If only a single decimal is included, then the leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; is required to trigger the dotted-decimal
parsing. A leading zero is permitted, though not recommended
except when quoted, because of the risk that Perl will treat
the number as octal. A trailing underscore plus one or more
digits denotes an alpha or development release (and must be
quoted to be parsed properly).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For decimal
versions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1 <br>
1.2345 <br>
1.2345_01</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">an integer
portion, an optional decimal point, and optionally one or
more digits to the right of the decimal are all required. A
trailing underscore is permitted and a leading zero is
permitted. Just like the lax dotted-decimal version, quoting
the values is required for alpha/development forms to be
parsed correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$version::STRICT</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This regexp covers a much more
limited set of formats and constitutes the best practices
for initializing version objects. Whether you choose to
employ decimal or dotted-decimal for is a personal
preference however. <br>
v1.234.5</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">For dotted-decimal versions, a
leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; is required, with three or more
sub-versions of no more than three digits. A leading 0
(zero) before the first sub-version (in the above example,
&rsquo;1&rsquo;) is also prohibited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">2.3456</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">For decimal versions, an
integer portion (no leading 0), a decimal point, and one or
more digits to the right of the decimal are all
required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both of the
provided scalars are already compiled as regular expressions
and do not contain either anchors or implicit groupings, so
they can be included in your own regular expressions freely.
For example, consider the following code:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">($pkg, $ver) =~
/ <br>
^[ \t]* <br>
use [ \t]+($PKGNAME) <br>
(?:[ \t]+($version::STRICT))? <br>
[ \t]*; <br>
/x;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This would
match a line of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
Foo::Bar::Baz v1.2.3; # legal only in Perl 5.8.1+</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where $PKGNAME
is another regular expression that defines the legal forms
for package names.</p>

<h2>IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
<a name="IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Equivalence
between Decimal and Dotted-Decimal Versions</b> <br>
When Perl 5.6.0 was released, the decision was made to
provide a transformation between the old-style decimal
versions and new-style dotted-decimal versions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5.6.0 ==
5.006000 <br>
5.005_04 == 5.5.40</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The floating
point number is taken and split first on the single decimal
place, then each group of three digits to the right of the
decimal makes up the next digit, and so on until the number
of significant digits is exhausted, <b>plus</b> enough
trailing zeros to reach the next multiple of three.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This was the
method that version.pm adopted as well. Some examples may be
helpful:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">equivalent <br>
decimal zero&minus;padded dotted&minus;decimal <br>
&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
<br>
1.2 1.200 v1.200.0 <br>
1.02 1.020 v1.20.0 <br>
1.002 1.002 v1.2.0 <br>
1.0023 1.002300 v1.2.300 <br>
1.00203 1.002030 v1.2.30 <br>
1.002003 1.002003 v1.2.3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Quoting
Rules</b> <br>
Because of the nature of the Perl parsing and tokenizing
routines, certain initialization values <b>must</b> be
quoted in order to correctly parse as the intended version,
especially when using the &quot;declare&quot; or
&quot;<b>qv()</b>&quot; methods. While you do not have to
quote decimal numbers when creating version objects, it is
always safe to quote <b>all</b> initial values when using
version.pm methods, as this will ensure that what you type
is what is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
if you quote your initializer, then the quoted value that
goes <b>in</b> will be exactly what comes <b>out</b> when
your $VERSION is printed (stringified). If you do not quote
your value, Perl&rsquo;s normal numeric handling comes into
play and you may not get back what you were expecting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use a
mathematic formula that resolves to a floating point number,
you are dependent on Perl&rsquo;s conversion routines to
yield the version you expect. You are pretty safe by
dividing by a power of 10, for example, but other operations
are not likely to be what you intend. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$VERSION =
version&minus;&gt;new((qw$Revision: 1.4)[1]/10); <br>
print $VERSION; # yields 0.14 <br>
$V2 = version&minus;&gt;new(100/9); # Integer overflow in
decimal number <br>
print $V2; # yields something like 11.111.111.100</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.8.1 and
beyond are able to automatically quote v&minus;strings but
that is not possible in earlier versions of Perl. In other
words:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$version =
version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v2.5.4&quot;); # legal in all
versions of Perl <br>
$newvers = version&minus;&gt;new(v2.5.4); # legal only in
Perl &gt;= 5.8.1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What about
v&minus;strings?</b> <br>
There are two ways to enter v&minus;strings: a bare number
with two or more decimal points, or a bare number with one
or more decimal points and a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo;
character (also bare). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$vs1 = 1.2.3; #
encoded as \1\2\3 <br>
$vs2 = v1.2; # encoded as \1\2</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
use of bare v&minus;strings to initialize version objects is
<b>strongly</b> discouraged in all circumstances. Also, bare
v&minus;strings are not completely supported in any version
of Perl prior to 5.8.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you insist
on using bare v&minus;strings with Perl &gt; 5.6.0, be aware
of the following limitations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1) For Perl
releases 5.6.0 through 5.8.0, the v&minus;string code merely
guesses, based on some characteristics of v&minus;strings.
You <b>must</b> use a three part version, e.g. 1.2.3 or
v1.2.3 in order for this heuristic to be successful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2) For Perl
releases 5.8.1 and later, v&minus;strings have changed in
the Perl core to be magical, which means that the version.pm
code can automatically determine whether the v&minus;string
encoding was used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3) In all
cases, a version created using v&minus;strings will have a
stringified form that has a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo;
character, for the simple reason that sometimes it is
impossible to tell whether one was present initially.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Version
Object Internals</b> <br>
version.pm provides an overloaded version object that is
designed to both encapsulate the author&rsquo;s intended
$VERSION assignment as well as make it completely natural to
use those objects as if they were numbers (e.g. for
comparisons). To do this, a version object contains both the
original representation as typed by the author, as well as a
parsed representation to ease comparisons. Version objects
employ overload methods to simplify code that needs to
compare, print, etc the objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The internal
structure of version objects is a blessed hash with several
components:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bless( { <br>
'original' =&gt; 'v1.2.3_4', <br>
'alpha' =&gt; 1, <br>
'qv' =&gt; 1, <br>
'version' =&gt; [ <br>
1, <br>
2, <br>
3, <br>
4 <br>
] <br>
}, 'version' ); <br>
original</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A faithful representation of
the value used to initialize this version object. The only
time this will not be precisely the same characters that
exist in the source file is if a short dotted-decimal
version like v1.2 was used (in which case it will contain
&rsquo;v1.2&rsquo;). This form is
<b><small>STRONGLY</small></b> discouraged, in that it will
confuse you and your users.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p>A boolean that denotes whether this is a decimal or

version.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">alpha</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A boolean that denotes whether
this is an alpha version. <small>NOTE:</small> that the
underscore can only appear in the last position. See
&quot;<b>is_alpha()</b>&quot; in version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">version</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An array of non-negative
integers that is used for comparison purposes with other
version objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Replacement
<small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION</small></b> <br>
In addition to the version objects, this modules also
replaces the core <small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION</small> function
with one that uses version objects for its comparisons. The
return from this operator is always the stringified form as
a simple scalar (i.e. not an object), but the warning
message generated includes either the stringified form or
the normal form, depending on how it was called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package Foo;
<br>
$VERSION = 1.2; <br>
package Bar; <br>
$VERSION = &quot;v1.3.5&quot;; # works with all Perl's
(since it is quoted) <br>
package main; <br>
use version; <br>
print $Foo::VERSION; # prints 1.2 <br>
print $Bar::VERSION; # prints 1.003005 <br>
eval &quot;use foo 10&quot;; <br>
print $@; # prints &quot;foo version 10 required...&quot;
<br>
eval &quot;use foo 1.3.5; # work in Perl 5.6.1 or better
<br>
print $@; # prints &quot;foo version 1.3.5 required...&quot;
<br>
eval &quot;use bar 1.3.6&quot;; <br>
print $@; # prints &quot;bar version 1.3.6 required...&quot;
<br>
eval &quot;use bar 1.004&quot;; # note Decimal version <br>
print $@; # prints &quot;bar version 1.004
required...&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>IMPORTANT
NOTE:</small> This may mean that code which searches for a
specific string (to determine whether a given module is
available) may need to be changed. It is always better to
use the built-in comparison implicit in &quot;use&quot; or
&quot;require&quot;, rather than manually poking at
&quot;class&minus;&gt;VERSION&quot; and then doing a
comparison yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The replacement
<small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION,</small> when used as a function,
like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print
$module&minus;&gt;VERSION;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will also
exclusively return the stringified form. See
&quot;Stringification&quot; for more details.</p>

<h2>USAGE DETAILS
<a name="USAGE DETAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
modules that use version.pm</b> <br>
As much as possible, the version.pm module remains
compatible with all current code. However, if your module is
using a module that has defined $VERSION using the version
class, there are a couple of things to be aware of. For
purposes of discussion, we will assume that we have the
following module installed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
Example; <br>
use version; $VERSION = qv('1.2.2'); <br>
...module code here... <br>
1; <br>
Decimal versions always work</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Code of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use Example
1.002003;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">will always
work correctly. The &quot;use&quot; will perform an
automatic $VERSION comparison using the floating point
number given as the first term after the module name (e.g.
above 1.002.003). In this case, the installed module is too
old for the requested line, so you would see an error
like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example version
1.002003 (v1.2.3) required&minus;&minus;this is only version
1.002002 (v1.2.2)...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Dotted-Decimal version work
sometimes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With Perl &gt;= 5.6.2, you can
also use a line like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use Example
1.2.3;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and it will
again work (i.e. give the error message as above), even with
releases of Perl which do not normally support
v&minus;strings (see &quot;What about v&minus;strings?&quot;
above). This has to do with that fact that &quot;use&quot;
only checks to see if the second term <i>looks like a
number</i> and passes that to the replacement
<small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION</small> . This is not true in Perl
5.005_04, however, so you are <b>strongly encouraged</b> to
always use a Decimal version in your code, even for those
versions of Perl which support the Dotted-Decimal
version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Object
Methods <br>
new()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like many <small>OO</small>
interfaces, the <b>new()</b> method is used to initialize
version objects. If two arguments are passed to
&quot;new()&quot;, the <b>second</b> one will be used as if
it were prefixed with &quot;v&quot;. This is to support
historical use of the &quot;qw&quot; operator with the
<small>CVS</small> variable $Revision, which is
automatically incremented by <small>CVS</small> every time
the file is committed to the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
facilitate this feature, the following code can be
employed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$VERSION =
version&minus;&gt;new(qw$Revision: 2.7 $);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and the version
object will be created as if the following code were
used:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$VERSION =
version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v2.7&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
the version will be automatically parsed out of the string,
and it will be quoted to preserve the meaning
<small>CVS</small> normally carries for versions. The
<small>CVS</small> $Revision$ increments differently from
Decimal versions (i.e. 1.10 follows 1.9), so it must be
handled as if it were a Dotted-Decimal Version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A new version
object can be created as a copy of an existing version
object, either as a class method:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$v1 =
version&minus;&gt;new(12.3); <br>
$v2 = version&minus;&gt;new($v1);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or as an object
method:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$v1 =
version&minus;&gt;new(12.3); <br>
$v2 = $v1&minus;&gt;new(12.3);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and in each
case, $v1 and $v2 will be identical. <small>NOTE:</small> if
you create a new object using an existing object like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$v2 =
$v1&minus;&gt;new();</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">the new object
<b>will not</b> be a clone of the existing object. In the
example case, $v2 will be an empty object of the same type
as $v1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>qv()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An alternate way to create a
new version object is through the exported <b>qv()</b> sub.
This is not strictly like other q? operators (like qq, qw),
in that the only delimiters supported are parentheses (or
spaces). It is the best way to initialize a short version
without triggering the floating point interpretation. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$v1 = qv(1.2);
# v1.2.0 <br>
$v2 = qv(&quot;1.2&quot;); # also v1.2.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see,
either a bare number or a quoted string can usually be used
interchangeably, except in the case of a trailing zero,
which must be quoted to be converted properly. For this
reason, it is strongly recommended that all initializers to
<b>qv()</b> be quoted strings instead of bare numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To prevent the
&quot;qv()&quot; function from being exported to the
caller&rsquo;s namespace, either use version with a null
parameter:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use version
();</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or just require
version, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">require
version;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Both methods
will prevent the <b>import()</b> method from firing and
exporting the &quot;qv()&quot; sub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
subsequent examples, the following three objects will be
used:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$ver =
version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;1.2.3.4&quot;); # see
&quot;Quoting Rules&quot; <br>
$alpha = version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;1.2.3_4&quot;); # see
&quot;Alpha Versions&quot; <br>
$nver = version&minus;&gt;new(1.002); # see &quot;Decimal
Versions&quot; <br>
Normal Form</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For any version object which is
initialized with multiple decimal places (either quoted or
if possible v&minus;string), or initialized using the
<b>qv()</b> operator, the stringified representation is
returned in a normalized or reduced form (no extraneous
zeros), and with a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">print
$ver&minus;&gt;normal; # prints as v1.2.3.4 <br>
print $ver&minus;&gt;stringify; # ditto <br>
print $ver; # ditto <br>
print $nver&minus;&gt;normal; # prints as v1.2.0 <br>
print $nver&minus;&gt;stringify; # prints as 1.002, <br>
# see &quot;Stringification&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
preserve the meaning of the processed version, the
normalized representation will always contain at least three
sub terms. In other words, the following is guaranteed to
always be true:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">my $newver =
version&minus;&gt;new($ver&minus;&gt;stringify); <br>
if ($newver eq $ver ) # always true <br>
{...}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Numification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Although all mathematical
operations on version objects are forbidden by default, it
is possible to retrieve a number which corresponds to the
version object through the use of the $obj&minus;&gt;numify
method. For formatting purposes, when displaying a number
which corresponds a version object, all sub versions are
assumed to have three decimal places. So for example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">print
$ver&minus;&gt;numify; # prints 1.002003004 <br>
print $nver&minus;&gt;numify; # prints 1.002</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike the
stringification operator, there is never any need to append
trailing zeros to preserve the correct version value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Stringification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default stringification for
version objects returns exactly the same string as was used
to create it, whether you used &quot;new()&quot; or
&quot;qv()&quot;, with one exception. The sole exception is
if the object was created using &quot;qv()&quot; and the
initializer did not have two decimal places or a leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; (both optional), then the stringified form
will have a leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; prepended, in order to
support round-trip processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Initialized as
Stringifies to <br>
============== ============== <br>
version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;1.2&quot;) 1.2 <br>
version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v1.2&quot;) v1.2 <br>
qv(&quot;1.2.3&quot;) 1.2.3 <br>
qv(&quot;v1.3.5&quot;) v1.3.5 <br>
qv(&quot;1.2&quot;) v1.2 ### exceptional case</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See also
<small>UNIVERSAL::VERSION</small> , as this also returns the
stringified form when used as a class method.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>IMPORTANT
NOTE:</small> There is one exceptional cases shown in the
above table where the &quot;initializer&quot; is not
stringwise equivalent to the stringified representation. If
you use the &quot;qv&quot;() operator on a version without a
leading &rsquo;v&rsquo; <b>and</b> with only a single
decimal place, the stringified output will have a leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo;, to preserve the sense. See the
&quot;<b>qv()</b>&quot; operator for more details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>IMPORTANT
NOTE 2:</small> Attempting to bypass the normal
stringification rules by manually applying <b>numify()</b>
and <b>normal()</b> will sometimes yield surprising
results:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">print
version&minus;&gt;new(version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;v1.0&quot;)&minus;&gt;numify)&minus;&gt;normal;
# v1.0.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
this is that the <b>numify()</b> operator will turn
&quot;v1.0&quot; into the equivalent string
&quot;1.000000&quot;. Forcing the outer version object to
<b>normal()</b> form will display the mathematically
equivalent &quot;v1.0.0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As the example
in &quot;<b>new()</b>&quot; shows, you can always create a
copy of an existing version object with the same value by
the very compact:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$v2 =
$v1&minus;&gt;new($v1);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and be assured
that both $v1 and $v2 will be completely equivalent, down to
the same internal representation as well as
stringification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Comparison operators</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Both &quot;cmp&quot; and
&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot; operators perform the same comparison
between terms (upgrading to a version object automatically).
Perl automatically generates all of the other comparison
operators based on those two. In addition to the obvious
equalities listed below, appending a single trailing 0 term
does not change the value of a version for comparison
purposes. In other words &quot;v1.2&quot; and
&quot;1.2.0&quot; will compare as identical.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the following relations hold:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As Number As
String Truth Value <br>

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
<br>
$ver &gt; 1.0 $ver gt &quot;1.0&quot; true <br>
$ver &lt; 2.5 $ver lt true <br>
$ver != 1.3 $ver ne &quot;1.3&quot; true <br>
$ver == 1.2 $ver eq &quot;1.2&quot; false <br>
$ver == 1.2.3.4 $ver eq &quot;1.2.3.4&quot; see discussion
below</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is probably
best to chose either the Decimal notation or the string
notation and stick with it, to reduce confusion. Perl6
version objects <b>may</b> only support Decimal comparisons.
See also &quot;Quoting Rules&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>WARNING:</small>
Comparing version with unequal numbers of decimal points
(whether explicitly or implicitly initialized), may yield
unexpected results at first glance. For example, the
following inequalities hold:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">version&minus;&gt;new(0.96)
&gt; version&minus;&gt;new(0.95); # 0.960.0 &gt; 0.950.0
<br>
version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;0.96.1&quot;) &lt;
version&minus;&gt;new(0.95); # 0.096.1 &lt; 0.950.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For this
reason, it is best to use either exclusively &quot;Decimal
Versions&quot; or &quot;Dotted-Decimal Versions&quot; with
multiple decimal points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Logical Operators</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you need to test whether a
version object has been initialized, you can simply test it
directly:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$vobj =
version&minus;&gt;new($something); <br>
if ( $vobj ) # true only if $something was
non&minus;blank</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
test whether a version object is an alpha version, for
example to prevent the use of some feature not present in
the main release:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$vobj =
version&minus;&gt;new(&quot;1.2_3&quot;); # MUST QUOTE <br>
...later... <br>
if ( $vobj&minus;&gt;is_alpha ) # True</p>
