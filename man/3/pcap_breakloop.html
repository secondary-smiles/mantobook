<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pcap_breakloop</b>()
sets a flag that will force <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP) or
<b>pcap_loop</b>(3PCAP) to return rather than looping; they
will return the number of packets that have been processed
so far, or <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</b> if no packets have been
processed so far. If the loop is currently blocked waiting
for packets to arrive, <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() will also, on
some platforms, wake up the thread that is blocked. In this
version of libpcap, the only platforms on which a wakeup is
caused by <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() are Linux and Windows, and
the wakeup will only be caused when capturing on network
interfaces; it will not be caused on other operating
systems, and will not be caused on any OS when capturing on
other types of devices.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This routine is
safe to use inside a signal handler on UNIX or a console
control handler on Windows, or in a thread other than the
one in which the loop is running, as it merely sets a flag
that is checked within the loop and, on some platforms,
performs a signal-safe and thread-safe API call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The flag is
checked in loops reading packets from the OS - a signal by
itself will not necessarily terminate those loops - as well
as in loops processing a set of packets returned by the OS.
<b>Note that if you are catching signals on UNIX systems
that support restarting system calls after a signal, and
calling pcap_breakloop() in the signal handler, you must
specify, when catching those signals, that system calls
should NOT be restarted by that signal. Otherwise, if the
signal interrupted a call reading packets in a live capture,
when your signal handler returns after calling
pcap_breakloop(), the call will be restarted, and the loop
will not terminate until more packets arrive and the call
completes.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note also
that, in a multi-threaded application, if one thread is
blocked in pcap_dispatch(), pcap_loop(), pcap_next(3PCAP),
or pcap_next_ex(3PCAP), a call to pcap_breakloop() in a
different thread will only unblock that thread on the
platforms and capture devices listed above.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a non-zero
packet buffer timeout is set on the <b>pcap_t</b>, and you
are capturing on a network interface, the thread will be
unblocked with the timeout expires. This is not guaranteed
to happen unless at least one packet has arrived; the only
platforms on which it happens are macOS, the BSDs, Solaris
11, AIX, Tru64 UNIX, and Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
ensure that the loop will eventually be unblocked on any
other platforms, or unblocked when capturing on a device
other than a network interface, you will need to use
whatever mechanism the OS provides for breaking a thread out
of blocking calls in order to unblock the thread, such as
thread cancellation or thread signalling in systems that
support POSIX threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note that if
pcap_breakloop() unblocks the thread capturing packets, and
you are running on a platform that supports packet
buffering, there may be packets in the buffer that arrived
before pcap_breakloop() were called but that weren&rsquo;t
yet provided to libpcap, those packets will not have been
processed by pcap_dispatch() or pcap_loop(). If
pcap_breakloop() was called in order to terminate the
capture process, then, in order to process those packets,
you would have to call pcap_dispatch() one time in order to
process the last batch of packets. This may block until the
packet buffer timeout expires, so a non-zero packet buffer
timeout must be used.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>pcap_next</b>() and <b>pcap_next_ex</b>() will, on some
platforms, loop reading packets from the OS; that loop will
not necessarily be terminated by a signal, so
<b>pcap_breakloop</b>() should be used to terminate packet
processing even if <b>pcap_next</b>() or
<b>pcap_next_ex</b>() is being used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pcap_breakloop</b>()
does not guarantee that no further packets will be processed
by <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() or <b>pcap_loop</b>() after it is
called; at most one more packet might be processed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</b> is returned from
<b>pcap_dispatch</b>() or <b>pcap_loop</b>(), the flag is
cleared, so a subsequent call will resume reading packets.
If a positive number is returned, the flag is not cleared,
so a subsequent call will return <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</b> and
clear the flag.</p>

<h2>BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
<a name="BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This function
became available in libpcap release 0.8.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In releases
prior to libpcap 1.10.0, <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() will not
wake up a blocked thread on any platform.</p>
