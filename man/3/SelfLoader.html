<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
tells its users that functions in the <small>FOOBAR</small>
package are to be autoloaded from after the
&quot;__DATA__&quot; token. See also &quot;Autoloading&quot;
in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The __DATA__
token</b> <br>
The &quot;__DATA__&quot; token tells the perl compiler that
the perl code for compilation is finished. Everything after
the &quot;__DATA__&quot; token is available for reading via
the filehandle <small>FOOBAR::DATA,</small> where
<small>FOOBAR</small> is the name of the current package
when the &quot;__DATA__&quot; token is reached. This works
just the same as &quot;__END__&quot; does in package
&rsquo;main&rsquo;, but for other modules data after
&quot;__END__&quot; is not automatically retrievable,
whereas data after &quot;__DATA__&quot; is. The
&quot;__DATA__&quot; token is not recognized in versions of
perl prior to 5.001m.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that it is
possible to have &quot;__DATA__&quot; tokens in the same
package in multiple files, and that the last
&quot;__DATA__&quot; token in a given package that is
encountered by the compiler is the one accessible by the
filehandle. This also applies to &quot;__END__&quot; and
main, i.e. if the &rsquo;main&rsquo; program has an
&quot;__END__&quot;, but a module &rsquo;require&rsquo;d
(_not_ &rsquo;use&rsquo;d) by that program has a
&rsquo;package main;&rsquo; declaration followed by an
&rsquo;&quot;__DATA__&quot;&rsquo;, then the
&quot;DATA&quot; filehandle is set to access the data after
the &quot;__DATA__&quot; in the module, _not_ the data after
the &quot;__END__&quot; token in the &rsquo;main&rsquo;
program, since the compiler encounters the
&rsquo;require&rsquo;d file later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SelfLoader
autoloading</b> <br>
The <b>SelfLoader</b> works by the user placing the
&quot;__DATA__&quot; token <i>after</i> perl code which
needs to be compiled and run at &rsquo;require&rsquo; time,
but <i>before</i> subroutine declarations that can be loaded
in later &minus; usually because they may never be
called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> will read from the
<small>FOOBAR::DATA</small> filehandle to load in the data
after &quot;__DATA__&quot;, and load in any subroutine when
it is called. The costs are the one-time parsing of the data
after &quot;__DATA__&quot;, and a load delay for the _first_
call of any autoloaded function. The benefits (hopefully)
are a speeded up compilation phase, with no need to load
functions which are never used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> will stop reading from
&quot;__DATA__&quot; if it encounters the
&quot;__END__&quot; token &minus; just as you would expect.
If the &quot;__END__&quot; token is present, and is followed
by the token <small>DATA,</small> then the <b>SelfLoader</b>
leaves the <small>FOOBAR::DATA</small> filehandle open on
the line after that token.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> exports the &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;
subroutine to the package using the <b>SelfLoader</b>, and
this loads the called subroutine when it is first
called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
advantage to putting subroutines which will _always_ be
called after the &quot;__DATA__&quot; token.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Autoloading
and package lexicals</b> <br>
A &rsquo;my $pack_lexical&rsquo; statement makes the
variable $pack_lexical local _only_ to the file up to the
&quot;__DATA__&quot; token. Subroutines declared elsewhere
_cannot_ see these types of variables, just as if you
declared subroutines in the package but in another file,
they cannot see these variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So
specifically, autoloaded functions cannot see package
lexicals (this applies to both the <b>SelfLoader</b> and the
Autoloader). The &quot;vars&quot; pragma provides an
alternative to defining package-level globals that will be
visible to autoloaded routines. See the documentation on
<b>vars</b> in the pragma section of perlmod.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SelfLoader
and AutoLoader</b> <br>
The <b>SelfLoader</b> can replace the AutoLoader &minus;
just change &rsquo;use AutoLoader&rsquo; to &rsquo;use
SelfLoader&rsquo; (though note that the <b>SelfLoader</b>
exports the <small>AUTOLOAD</small> function &minus; but if
you have your own <small>AUTOLOAD</small> and are using the
AutoLoader too, you probably know what you&rsquo;re doing),
and the &quot;__END__&quot; token to &quot;__DATA__&quot;.
You will need perl version 5.001m or later to use this
(version 5.001 with all patches up to patch m).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
need to inherit from the <b>SelfLoader</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> works similarly to the AutoLoader, but
picks up the subs from after the &quot;__DATA__&quot;
instead of in the &rsquo;lib/auto&rsquo; directory. There is
a maintenance gain in not needing to run AutoSplit on the
module at installation, and a runtime gain in not needing to
keep opening and closing files to load subs. There is a
runtime loss in needing to parse the code after the
&quot;__DATA__&quot;. Details of the <b>AutoLoader</b> and
another view of these distinctions can be found in that
module&rsquo;s documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>__DATA__,
__END__, and the <small>FOOBAR::DATA</small> filehandle.</b>
<br>
This section is only relevant if you want to use the
&quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot; together with the
<b>SelfLoader</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Data after the
&quot;__DATA__&quot; token in a module is read using the
<small>FOOBAR::DATA</small> filehandle. &quot;__END__&quot;
can still be used to denote the end of the
&quot;__DATA__&quot; section if followed by the token
<small>DATA</small> &minus; this is supported by the
<b>SelfLoader</b>. The &quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot; filehandle
is left open if an &quot;__END__&quot; followed by a
<small>DATA</small> is found, with the filehandle positioned
at the start of the line after the &quot;__END__&quot;
token. If no &quot;__END__&quot; token is present, or an
&quot;__END__&quot; token with no <small>DATA</small> token
on the same line, then the filehandle is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> reads from wherever the current position
of the &quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot; filehandle is, until the
<small>EOF</small> or &quot;__END__&quot;. This means that
if you want to use that filehandle (and <small>ONLY</small>
if you want to), you should either</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. Put all your
subroutine declarations immediately after the
&quot;__DATA__&quot; token and put your own data after those
declarations, using the &quot;__END__&quot; token to mark
the end of subroutine declarations. You must also ensure
that the <b>SelfLoader</b> reads first by calling
&rsquo;SelfLoader&minus;&gt;<b>load_stubs()</b>;&rsquo;, or
by using a function which is selfloaded;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. You should
read the &quot;FOOBAR::DATA&quot; filehandle first, leaving
the handle open and positioned at the first line of
subroutine declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You could
conceivably do both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Classes and
inherited methods.</b> <br>
For modules which are not classes, this section is not
relevant. This section is only relevant if you have methods
which could be inherited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A subroutine
stub (or forward declaration) looks like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub stub;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">i.e. it is a
subroutine declaration without the body of the subroutine.
For modules which are not classes, there is no real need for
stubs as far as autoloading is concerned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For modules
which <small>ARE</small> classes, and need to handle
inherited methods, stubs are needed to ensure that the
method inheritance mechanism works properly. You can load
the stubs into the module at &rsquo;require&rsquo; time, by
adding the statement
&rsquo;SelfLoader&minus;&gt;<b>load_stubs()</b>;&rsquo; to
the module to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The alternative
is to put the stubs in before the &quot;__DATA__&quot; token
<small>BEFORE</small> releasing the module, and for this
purpose the &quot;Devel::SelfStubber&quot; module is
available. However this does require the extra step of
ensuring that the stubs are in the module. If this is done I
strongly recommend that this is done <small>BEFORE</small>
releasing the module &minus; it should <small>NOT</small> be
done at install time in general.</p>

<h2>Multiple packages and fully qualified subroutine names
<a name="Multiple packages and fully qualified subroutine names"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Subroutines in
multiple packages within the same file are supported &minus;
but you should note that this requires exporting the
&quot;SelfLoader::AUTOLOAD&quot; to every package which
requires it. This is done automatically by the
<b>SelfLoader</b> when it first loads the subs into the
cache, but you should really specify it in the
initialization before the &quot;__DATA__&quot; by putting a
&rsquo;use SelfLoader&rsquo; statement in each package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fully qualified
subroutine names are also supported. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">__DATA__ <br>
sub foo::bar {23} <br>
package baz; <br>
sub dob {32}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will all be
loaded correctly by the <b>SelfLoader</b>, and the
<b>SelfLoader</b> will ensure that the packages
&rsquo;foo&rsquo; and &rsquo;baz&rsquo; correctly have the
<b>SelfLoader</b> &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; method when the data
after &quot;__DATA__&quot; is first parsed.</p>
