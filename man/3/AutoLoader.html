&minus; load subroutines only on demand</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package Foo;
<br>
use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD'; # import the default AUTOLOAD
subroutine <br>
package Bar; <br>
use AutoLoader; # don't import AUTOLOAD, define our own <br>
sub AUTOLOAD { <br>
... <br>
$AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD = &quot;...&quot;; <br>
goto &amp;AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD; <br>
}</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>AutoLoader</b> module works with the <b>AutoSplit</b>
module and the &quot;__END__&quot; token to defer the
loading of some subroutines until they are used rather than
loading them all at once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use
<b>AutoLoader</b>, the author of a module has to place the
definitions of subroutines to be autoloaded after an
&quot;__END__&quot; token. (See perldata.) The
<b>AutoSplit</b> module can then be run manually to extract
the definitions into individual files
<i>auto/funcname.al</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>AutoLoader</b>
implements an <small>AUTOLOAD</small> subroutine. When an
undefined subroutine in is called in a client module of
<b>AutoLoader</b>, <b>AutoLoader</b>&rsquo;s
<small>AUTOLOAD</small> subroutine attempts to locate the
subroutine in a file with a name related to the location of
the file from which the client module was read. As an
example, if <i><small>POSIX</small> .pm</i> is located in
<i>/usr/local/lib/perl5/POSIX.pm</i>, <b>AutoLoader</b> will
look for perl subroutines <b><small>POSIX</small></b> in
<i>/usr/local/lib/perl5/auto/POSIX/*.al</i>, where the
&quot;.al&quot; file has the same name as the subroutine,
sans package. If such a file exists, <small>AUTOLOAD</small>
will read and evaluate it, thus (presumably) defining the
needed subroutine. <small>AUTOLOAD</small> will then
&quot;goto&quot; the newly defined subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once this
process completes for a given function, it is defined, so
future calls to the subroutine will bypass the
<small>AUTOLOAD</small> mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Subroutine
Stubs</b> <br>
In order for object method lookup and/or prototype checking
to operate correctly even when methods have not yet been
defined it is necessary to &quot;forward declare&quot; each
subroutine (as in &quot;sub NAME;&quot;). See &quot;
<small>SYNOPSIS&quot;</small> in perlsub. Such forward
declaration creates &quot;subroutine stubs&quot;, which are
place holders with no code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The AutoSplit
and <b>AutoLoader</b> modules automate the creation of
forward declarations. The AutoSplit module creates an
&rsquo;index&rsquo; file containing forward declarations of
all the AutoSplit subroutines. When the AutoLoader module is
&rsquo;use&rsquo;d it loads these declarations into its
callers package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of this
mechanism it is important that <b>AutoLoader</b> is always
&quot;use&quot;d and not &quot;require&quot;d.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
AutoLoader&rsquo;s <small>AUTOLOAD</small> Subroutine</b>
<br>
In order to use <b>AutoLoader</b>&rsquo;s
<small>AUTOLOAD</small> subroutine you <i>must</i>
explicitly import it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use AutoLoader
'AUTOLOAD';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Overriding
AutoLoader&rsquo;s <small>AUTOLOAD</small> Subroutine</b>
<br>
Some modules, mainly extensions, provide their own
<small>AUTOLOAD</small> subroutines. They typically need to
check for some special cases (such as constants) and then
fallback to <b>AutoLoader</b>&rsquo;s
<small>AUTOLOAD</small> for the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Such modules
should <i>not</i> import <b>AutoLoader</b>&rsquo;s
<small>AUTOLOAD</small> subroutine. Instead, they should
define their own <small>AUTOLOAD</small> subroutines along
these lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use AutoLoader;
<br>
use Carp; <br>
sub AUTOLOAD { <br>
my $sub = $AUTOLOAD; <br>
(my $constname = $sub) =~ s/.*:://; <br>
my $val = constant($constname, @_ ? $_[0] : 0); <br>
if ($! != 0) { <br>
if ($! =~ /Invalid/ || $!{EINVAL}) { <br>
$AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD = $sub; <br>
goto &amp;AutoLoader::AUTOLOAD; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
croak &quot;Your vendor has not defined constant
$constname&quot;; <br>
} <br>
} <br>
*$sub = sub { $val }; # same as: eval &quot;sub $sub { $val
}&quot;; <br>
goto &amp;$sub; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If any
module&rsquo;s own <small>AUTOLOAD</small> subroutine has no
need to fallback to the AutoLoader&rsquo;s
<small>AUTOLOAD</small> subroutine (because it doesn&rsquo;t
have any AutoSplit subroutines), then that module should not
use <b>AutoLoader</b> at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Package
Lexicals</b> <br>
Package lexicals declared with &quot;my&quot; in the main
block of a package using <b>AutoLoader</b> will not be
visible to auto-loaded subroutines, due to the fact that the
given scope ends at the &quot;__END__&quot; marker. A module
using such variables as package globals will not work
properly under the <b>AutoLoader</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;vars&quot; pragma (see &quot;vars&quot; in perlmod)
may be used in such situations as an alternative to
explicitly qualifying all globals with the package
namespace. Variables pre-declared with this pragma will be
visible to any autoloaded routines (but will not be
invisible outside the package, unfortunately).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Not Using
AutoLoader</b> <br>
You can stop using AutoLoader by simply</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">no
AutoLoader;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>AutoLoader
vs. SelfLoader</b> <br>
The <b>AutoLoader</b> is similar in purpose to
<b>SelfLoader</b>: both delay the loading of
subroutines.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SelfLoader</b>
uses the &quot;__DATA__&quot; marker rather than
&quot;__END__&quot;. While this avoids the use of a
hierarchy of disk files and the associated open/close for
each routine loaded, <b>SelfLoader</b> suffers a startup
speed disadvantage in the one-time parsing of the lines
after &quot;__DATA__&quot;, after which routines are cached.
<b>SelfLoader</b> can also handle multiple packages in a
file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>AutoLoader</b>
only reads code as it is requested, and in many cases should
be faster, but requires a mechanism like <b>AutoSplit</b> be
used to create the individual files. ExtUtils::MakeMaker
will invoke <b>AutoSplit</b> automatically if
<b>AutoLoader</b> is used in a module source file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Forcing
AutoLoader to Load a Function</b> <br>
Sometimes, it can be necessary or useful to make sure that a
certain function is fully loaded by AutoLoader. This is the
case, for example, when you need to wrap a function to
inject debugging code. It is also helpful to force early
loading of code before forking to make use of copy-on-write
as much as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
AutoLoader 5.73, you can call the
&quot;AutoLoader::autoload_sub&quot; function with the
fully-qualified name of the function to load from its
<i>.al</i> file. The behaviour is exactly the same as if you
called the function, triggering the regular
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; mechanism, but it does not actually
execute the autoloaded function.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AutoLoaders
prior to Perl 5.002 had a slightly different interface. Any
old modules which use <b>AutoLoader</b> should be changed to
the new calling style. Typically this just means changing a
require to a use, adding the explicit 'AUTOLOAD' import if
needed, and removing <b>AutoLoader</b> from @ISA.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On systems with
restrictions on file name length, the file corresponding to
a subroutine may have a shorter name that the routine
itself. This can lead to conflicting file names. The
<i>AutoSplit</i> package warns of these potential conflicts
when used to split a module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AutoLoader may
fail to find the autosplit files (or even find the wrong
ones) in cases where @INC contains relative paths,
<b>and</b> the program does &quot;chdir&quot;.</p>

equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language

(The <br>
fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same

is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.) This is my
interpretation <br>
