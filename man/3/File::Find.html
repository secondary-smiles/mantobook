<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are
functions for searching through directory trees doing work
on each file found similar to the Unix <i>find</i> command.
File::Find exports two functions, &quot;find&quot; and
&quot;finddepth&quot;. They work similarly but have subtle
differences. <b><br>
find</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">find(\&amp;wanted,
@directories); <br>
find(\%options, @directories);</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;find()&quot;
does a depth-first search over the given @directories in the
order they are given. For each file or directory found, it
calls the &amp;wanted subroutine. (See below for details on
how to use the &amp;wanted function). Additionally, for each
directory found, it will &quot;chdir()&quot; into that
directory and continue the search, invoking the &amp;wanted
function on each file or subdirectory in the directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>finddepth</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">finddepth(\&amp;wanted,
@directories); <br>
finddepth(\%options, @directories);</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;finddepth()&quot;
works just like &quot;find()&quot; except that it invokes
the &amp;wanted function for a directory <i>after</i>
invoking it for the directory&rsquo;s contents. It does a
postorder traversal instead of a preorder traversal, working
from the bottom of the directory tree up where
&quot;find()&quot; works from the top of the tree down.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Despite the
name of the &quot;finddepth()&quot; function, both
&quot;find()&quot; and &quot;finddepth()&quot; perform a
depth-first search of the directory hierarchy.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>%options</b>
<br>
The first argument to &quot;find()&quot; is either a code
reference to your &amp;wanted function, or a hash reference
describing the operations to be performed for each file. The
code reference is described in &quot;The wanted
function&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are the
possible keys for the hash: <br>
&quot;wanted&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The value should be a code
reference. This code reference is described in &quot;The
wanted function&quot; below. The &amp;wanted subroutine is
mandatory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;bydepth&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reports the name of a directory
only <small>AFTER</small> all its entries have been
reported. Entry point &quot;finddepth()&quot; is a shortcut
for specifying &quot;{ bydepth =&gt; 1 }&quot; in the first
argument of &quot;find()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;preprocess&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The value should be a code
reference. This code reference is used to preprocess the
current directory. The name of the currently processed
directory is in $File::Find::dir. Your preprocessing
function is called after &quot;readdir()&quot;, but before
the loop that calls the &quot;wanted()&quot; function. It is
called with a list of strings (actually file/directory
names) and is expected to return a list of strings. The code
can be used to sort the file/directory names alphabetically,
numerically, or to filter out directory entries based on
their name alone. When <i>follow</i> or <i>follow_fast</i>
are in effect, &quot;preprocess&quot; is a no-op.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;postprocess&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The value should be a code
reference. It is invoked just before leaving the currently
processed directory. It is called in void context with no
arguments. The name of the current directory is in
$File::Find::dir. This hook is handy for summarizing a
directory, such as calculating its disk usage. When
<i>follow</i> or <i>follow_fast</i> are in effect,
&quot;postprocess&quot; is a no-op.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;follow&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Causes symbolic links to be
followed. Since directory trees with symbolic links
(followed) may contain files more than once and may even
have cycles, a hash has to be built up with an entry for
each file. This might be expensive both in space and time
for a large directory tree. See &quot;follow_fast&quot; and
&quot;follow_skip&quot; below. If either <i>follow</i> or
<i>follow_fast</i> is in effect:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>It is guaranteed that an <i>lstat</i> has been called
before the user&rsquo;s &quot;wanted()&quot; function is
called. This enables fast file checks involving
&quot;_&quot;. Note that this guarantee no longer holds if
<i>follow</i> or <i>follow_fast</i> are not set.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>There is a variable $File::Find::fullname which holds
the absolute pathname of the file with all symbolic links
resolved. If the link is a dangling symbolic link, then
fullname will be set to &quot;undef&quot;.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is a no-op
on Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;follow_fast&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is similar to
<i>follow</i> except that it may report some files more than
once. It does detect cycles, however. Since only symbolic
links have to be hashed, this is much cheaper both in space
and time. If processing a file more than once (by the
user&rsquo;s &quot;wanted()&quot; function) is worse than
just taking time, the option <i>follow</i> should be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is also a
no-op on Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;follow_skip&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;follow_skip==1&quot;,
which is the default, causes all files which are neither
directories nor symbolic links to be ignored if they are
about to be processed a second time. If a directory or a
symbolic link are about to be processed a second time,
File::Find dies.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;follow_skip==0&quot;
causes File::Find to die if any file is about to be
processed a second time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;follow_skip==2&quot;
causes File::Find to ignore any duplicate files and
directories but to proceed normally otherwise.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;dangling_symlinks&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies what to do with
symbolic links whose target doesn&rsquo;t exist. If true and
a code reference, will be called with the symbolic link name
and the directory it lives in as arguments. Otherwise, if
true and warnings are on, a warning of the form
&quot;symbolic_link_name is a dangling symbolic link\n&quot;
will be issued. If false, the dangling symbolic link will be
silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;no_chdir&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Does not &quot;chdir()&quot; to
each directory as it recurses. The &quot;wanted()&quot;
function will need to be aware of this, of course. In this
case, $_ will be the same as $File::Find::name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;untaint&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If find is used in taint-mode
(&minus;T command line switch or if <small>EUID</small> !=
<small>UID</small> or if <small>EGID</small> !=
<small>GID</small> ), then internally directory names have
to be untainted before they can be &quot;chdir&quot;&rsquo;d
to. Therefore they are checked against a regular expression
<i>untaint_pattern</i>. Note that all names passed to the
user&rsquo;s &quot;wanted()&quot; function are still
tainted. If this option is used while not in taint-mode,
&quot;untaint&quot; is a no-op.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;untaint_pattern&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See above. This should be set
using the &quot;qr&quot; quoting operator. The default is
set to &quot;qr|^([&minus;+@\w./]+)$|&quot;. Note that the
parentheses are vital.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;untaint_skip&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If set, a directory which fails
the <i>untaint_pattern</i> is skipped, including all its
sub-directories. The default is to &quot;die&quot; in such a
case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The wanted
function</b> <br>
The &quot;wanted()&quot; function does whatever
verifications you want on each file and directory. Note that
despite its name, the &quot;wanted()&quot; function is a
generic callback function, and does <b>not</b> tell
File::Find if a file is &quot;wanted&quot; or not. In fact,
its return value is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The wanted
function takes no arguments but rather does its work through
a collection of variables. <br>
$File::Find::dir is the current directory name, <br>
$_ is the current filename within that directory <br>
$File::Find::name is the complete pathname to the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The above
variables have all been localized and may be changed without
affecting data outside of the wanted function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
when examining the file <i>/some/path/foo.ext</i> you will
have:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$File::Find::dir
= /some/path/ <br>
$_ = foo.ext <br>
$File::Find::name = /some/path/foo.ext</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are
<b>chdir()</b>&rsquo;d to $File::Find::dir when the function
is called, unless &quot;no_chdir&quot; was specified. Note
that when changing to directories is in effect, the root
directory (<i>/</i>) is a somewhat special case inasmuch as
the concatenation of $File::Find::dir, '/' and $_ is not
literally equal to $File::Find::name. The table below
summarizes all variants:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$File::Find::name
$File::Find::dir $_ <br>
default / / . <br>
no_chdir=&gt;0 /etc / etc <br>
/etc/x /etc x <br>
no_chdir=&gt;1 / / / <br>
/etc / /etc <br>
/etc/x /etc /etc/x</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
&quot;follow&quot; or &quot;follow_fast&quot; are in effect,
there is also a $File::Find::fullname. The function may set
$File::Find::prune to prune the tree unless
&quot;bydepth&quot; was specified. Unless &quot;follow&quot;
or &quot;follow_fast&quot; is specified, for compatibility
reasons (find.pl, find2perl) there are in addition the
following globals available: $File::Find::topdir,
$File::Find::topdev, $File::Find::topino,
$File::Find::topmode and $File::Find::topnlink.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This library is
useful for the &quot;find2perl&quot; tool (distributed as
part of the App&minus;find2perl <small>CPAN</small>
distribution), which when fed,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">find2perl /
&minus;name .nfs\* &minus;mtime +7 \ <br>
&minus;exec rm &minus;f {} \; &minus;o &minus;fstype nfs
&minus;prune</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">produces
something like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub wanted {
<br>
/^\.nfs.*\z/s &amp;&amp; <br>
(($dev, $ino, $mode, $nlink, $uid, $gid) = lstat($_))
&amp;&amp; <br>
int(&minus;M _) &gt; 7 &amp;&amp; <br>
unlink($_) <br>
|| <br>
($nlink || (($dev, $ino, $mode, $nlink, $uid, $gid) =
lstat($_))) &amp;&amp; <br>
$dev &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; <br>
($File::Find::prune = 1); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notice the
&quot;_&quot; in the above &quot;int(&minus;M _)&quot;: the
&quot;_&quot; is a magical filehandle that caches the
information from the preceding &quot;stat()&quot;,
&quot;lstat()&quot;, or filetest.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
another interesting wanted function. It will find all
symbolic links that don&rsquo;t resolve:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub wanted {
<br>
&minus;l &amp;&amp; !&minus;e &amp;&amp; print &quot;bogus
link: $File::Find::name\n&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
may mix directories and (non-directory) files in the list of
directories to be searched by the &quot;wanted()&quot;
function.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">find(\&amp;wanted,
&quot;./foo&quot;, &quot;./bar&quot;,
&quot;./baz/epsilon&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the example
above, no file in <i>./baz/</i> other than
<i>./baz/epsilon</i> will be evaluated by
&quot;wanted()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also the
script &quot;pfind&quot; on <small>CPAN</small> for a nice
application of this module.</p>

<h2>WARNINGS
<a name="WARNINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you run your
program with the &quot;&minus;w&quot; switch, or if you use
the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma, File::Find will report
warnings for several weird situations. You can disable these
warnings by putting the statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">no warnings
'File::Find';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">in the
appropriate scope. See warnings for more info about lexical
warnings.</p>

<h2>BUGS AND CAVEATS
<a name="BUGS AND CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$dont_use_nlink</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">You can set the variable
$File::Find::dont_use_nlink to 0 if you are sure the
filesystem you are scanning reflects the number of
subdirectories in the parent directory&rsquo;s
&quot;nlink&quot; count.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you do set
$File::Find::dont_use_nlink to 0, you may notice an
improvement in speed at the risk of not recursing into
subdirectories if a filesystem doesn&rsquo;t populate
&quot;nlink&quot; as expected.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$File::Find::dont_use_nlink
now defaults to 1 on all platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symlinks</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Be aware that the option to
follow symbolic links can be dangerous. Depending on the
structure of the directory tree (including symbolic links to
directories) you might traverse a given (physical) directory
more than once (only if &quot;follow_fast&quot; is in
effect). Furthermore, deleting or changing files in a
symbolically linked directory might cause very unpleasant
surprises, since you delete or change files in an unknown
directory.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">File::Find used
to produce incorrect results if called recursively. During
the development of perl 5.8 this bug was fixed. The first
fixed version of File::Find was 1.01.</p>
