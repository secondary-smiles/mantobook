<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The File::Copy
module provides two basic functions, &quot;copy&quot; and
&quot;move&quot;, which are useful for getting the contents
of a file from one place to another. <br>
copy</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;copy&quot; function
takes two parameters: a file to copy from and a file to copy
to. Either argument may be a string, a FileHandle reference
or a FileHandle glob. Obviously, if the first argument is a
filehandle of some sort, it will be read from, and if it is
a file <i>name</i> it will be opened for reading. Likewise,
the second argument will be written to. If the second
argument does not exist but the parent directory does exist,
then it will be created. Trying to copy a file into a
non-existent directory is an error. Trying to copy a file on
top of itself is also an error. &quot;copy&quot; will not
overwrite read-only files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
destination (second argument) already exists and is a
directory, and the source (first argument) is not a
filehandle, then the source file will be copied into the
directory specified by the destination, using the same base
name as the source file. It&rsquo;s a failure to have a
filehandle as the source when the destination is a
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note that
passing in files as handles instead of names may lead to
loss of information on some operating systems; it is
recommended that you use file names whenever possible.</b>
Files are opened in binary mode where applicable. To get a
consistent behaviour when copying from a filehandle to a
file, use &quot;binmode&quot; on the filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">An optional
third parameter can be used to specify the buffer size used
for copying. This is the number of bytes from the first
file, that will be held in memory at any given time, before
being written to the second file. The default buffer size
depends upon the file, but will generally be the whole file
(up to 2MB), or 1k for filehandles that do not reference
files (eg. sockets).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You may use the
syntax &quot;use File::Copy &quot;cp&quot;&quot; to get at
the &quot;cp&quot; alias for this function. The syntax is
<i>exactly</i> the same. The behavior is nearly the same as
well: as of version 2.15, &quot;cp&quot; will preserve the
source file&rsquo;s permission bits like the shell utility
cp(1) would do, while &quot;copy&quot; uses the default
permissions for the target file (which may depend on the
process&rsquo; &quot;umask&quot;, file ownership, inherited
ACLs, etc.). If an error occurs in setting permissions,
&quot;cp&quot; will return 0, regardless of whether the file
was successfully copied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">move</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;move&quot; function
also takes two parameters: the current name and the intended
name of the file to be moved. If the destination already
exists and is a directory, and the source is not a
directory, then the source file will be renamed into the
directory specified by the destination.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If possible,
<b>move()</b> will simply rename the file. Otherwise, it
copies the file to the new location and deletes the
original. If an error occurs during this copy-and-delete
process, you may be left with a (possibly partial) copy of
the file under the destination name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You may use the
&quot;mv&quot; alias for this function in the same way that
you may use the &quot;cp&quot; alias for
&quot;copy&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syscopy</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">File::Copy also provides the
&quot;syscopy&quot; routine, which copies the file specified
in the first parameter to the file specified in the second
parameter, preserving OS-specific attributes and file
structure. For Unix systems, this is equivalent to the
simple &quot;copy&quot; routine, which doesn&rsquo;t
preserve OS-specific attributes. For <small>VMS</small>
systems, this calls the &quot;rmscopy&quot; routine (see
below). For <small>OS/2</small> systems, this calls the
&quot;syscopy&quot; <small>XSUB</small> directly. For Win32
systems, this calls &quot;Win32::CopyFile&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Special
behaviour if &quot;syscopy&quot; is defined ( <small>OS/2,
VMS</small> and Win32)</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If both
arguments to &quot;copy&quot; are not file handles, then
&quot;copy&quot; will perform a &quot;system copy&quot; of
the input file to a new output file, in order to preserve
file attributes, indexed file structure, <i>etc.</i> The
buffer size parameter is ignored. If either argument to
&quot;copy&quot; is a handle to an opened file, then data is
copied using Perl operators, and no effort is made to
preserve file attributes or record structure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The system copy
routine may also be called directly under <small>VMS</small>
and <small>OS/2</small> as &quot;File::Copy::syscopy&quot;
(or under <small>VMS</small> as
&quot;File::Copy::rmscopy&quot;, which is the routine that
does the actual work for syscopy).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">rmscopy($from,$to[,$date_flag])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The first and second arguments
may be strings, typeglobs, typeglob references, or objects
inheriting from IO::Handle; they are used in all cases to
obtain the <i>filespec</i> of the input and output files,
respectively. The name and type of the input file are used
as defaults for the output file, if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A new version
of the output file is always created, which inherits the
structure and <small>RMS</small> attributes of the input
file, except for owner and protections (and possibly
timestamps; see below). All data from the input file is
copied to the output file; if either of the first two
parameters to &quot;rmscopy&quot; is a file handle, its
position is unchanged. (Note that this means a file handle
pointing to the output file will be associated with an old
version of that file after &quot;rmscopy&quot; returns, not
the newly created version.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The third
parameter is an integer flag, which tells
&quot;rmscopy&quot; how to handle timestamps. If it is &lt;
0, none of the input file&rsquo;s timestamps are propagated
to the output file. If it is &gt; 0, then it is interpreted
as a bitmask: if bit 0 (the <small>LSB</small> ) is set,
then timestamps other than the revision date are propagated;
if bit 1 is set, the revision date is propagated. If the
third parameter to &quot;rmscopy&quot; is 0, then it behaves
much like the <small>DCL COPY</small> command: if the name
or type of the output file was explicitly specified, then no
timestamps are propagated, but if they were taken implicitly
from the input filespec, then all timestamps other than the
revision date are propagated. If this parameter is not
supplied, it defaults to 0.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;rmscopy&quot;
is <small>VMS</small> specific and cannot be exported; it
must be referenced by its full name, e.g.:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">File::Copy::rmscopy($from,
$to) or die $!;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Like
&quot;copy&quot;, &quot;rmscopy&quot; returns 1 on success.
If an error occurs, it sets $!, deletes the output file, and
returns 0.</p>

<h2>RETURN
<a name="RETURN"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All functions
return 1 on success, 0 on failure. $! will be set if an
error was encountered.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before calling
<b>copy()</b> or <b>move()</b> on a filehandle, the caller
should close or <b>flush()</b> the file to avoid writes
being lost. Note that this is the case even for
<b>move()</b>, because it may actually copy the file,
depending on the OS-specific implementation, and the
underlying filesystem(s).</p>
