<h2>PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE2
<a name="PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE2"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In normal use
of PCRE2, if there is a match up to the end of a subject
string, but more characters are needed to match the entire
pattern, PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH is returned, just like any
other failing match. There are circumstances where it might
be helpful to distinguish this &quot;partial match&quot;
case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One example is
an application where the subject string is very long, and
not all available at once. The requirement here is to be
able to do the matching segment by segment, but special
action is needed when a matched substring spans the boundary
between two segments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another example
is checking a user input string as it is typed, to ensure
that it conforms to a required format. Invalid characters
can be immediately diagnosed and rejected, giving instant
feedback.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Partial
matching is a PCRE2-specific feature; it is not
Perl-compatible. It is requested by setting one of the
PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD or PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT options when
calling a matching function. The difference between the two
options is whether or not a partial match is preferred to an
alternative complete match, though the details differ
between the two types of matching function. If both options
are set, PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
use partial matching with just-in-time optimized code, as
well as setting a partial match option for the matching
function, you must also call <b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b> with
one or both of these options:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD
<br>
PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE
should also be set if you are going to run non-partial
matches on the same pattern. Separate code is compiled for
each mode. If the appropriate JIT mode has not been
compiled, interpretive matching code is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setting a
partial matching option disables two of PCRE2&rsquo;s
standard optimization hints. PCRE2 remembers the last
literal code unit in a pattern, and abandons matching
immediately if it is not present in the subject string. This
optimization cannot be used for a subject string that might
match only partially. PCRE2 also remembers a minimum length
of a matching string, and does not bother to run the
matching function on shorter strings. This optimization is
also disabled for partial matching.</p>

<h2>REQUIREMENTS FOR A PARTIAL MATCH
<a name="REQUIREMENTS FOR A PARTIAL MATCH"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A possible
partial match occurs during matching when the end of the
subject string is reached successfully, but either more
characters are needed to complete the match, or the addition
of more characters might change what is matched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example 1: if
the pattern is /abc/ and the subject is &quot;ab&quot;, more
characters are definitely needed to complete a match. In
this case both hard and soft matching options yield a
partial match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example 2: if
the pattern is /ab+/ and the subject is &quot;ab&quot;, a
complete match can be found, but the addition of more
characters might change what is matched. In this case, only
PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD returns a partial match;
PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT returns the complete match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On reaching the
end of the subject, when PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, if the
next pattern item is \z, \Z, \b, \B, or $ there is always a
partial match. Otherwise, for both options, the next pattern
item must be one that inspects a character, and at least one
of the following must be true:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(1) At least
one character has already been inspected. An inspected
character need not form part of the final matched string;
lookbehind assertions and the \K escape sequence provide
ways of inspecting characters before the start of a matched
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(2) The pattern
contains one or more lookbehind assertions. This condition
exists in case there is a lookbehind that inspects
characters before the start of the match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(3) There is a
special case when the whole pattern can match an empty
string. When the starting point is at the end of the
subject, the empty string match is a possibility, and if
PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set and neither of the above
conditions is true, it is returned. However, because adding
more characters might result in a non-empty match,
PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD returns a partial match, which in this
case means &quot;there is going to be a match at this point,
but until some more characters are added, we do not know if
it will be an empty string or something longer&quot;.</p>

<h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_match()
<a name="PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_match()"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a partial
matching option is set, the result of calling
<b>pcre2_match()</b> can be one of the following: <b><br>
A successful match</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">A complete match has been
found, starting and ending within this subject.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">No match can start anywhere in
this subject.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Adding more characters may
result in a complete match that uses one or more characters
from the end of this subject.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a partial
match is returned, the first two elements in the ovector
point to the portion of the subject that was matched, but
the values in the rest of the ovector are undefined. The
appearance of \K in the pattern has no effect for a partial
match. Consider this pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/abc\K123/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If it is
matched against &quot;456abc123xyz&quot; the result is a
complete match, and the ovector defines the matched string
as &quot;123&quot;, because \K resets the &quot;start of
match&quot; point. However, if a partial match is requested
and the subject string is &quot;456abc12&quot;, a partial
match is found for the string &quot;abc12&quot;, because all
these characters are needed for a subsequent re-match with
additional characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there is
more than one partial match, the first one that was found
provides the data that is returned. Consider this
pattern:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/123\w+X|dogY/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If this is
matched against the subject string &quot;abc123dog&quot;,
both alternatives fail to match, but the end of the subject
is reached during matching, so PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is
returned. The offsets are set to 3 and 9, identifying
&quot;123dog&quot; as the first partial match. (In this
example, there are two partial matches, because
&quot;dog&quot; on its own partially matches the second
alternative.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How a
partial match is processed by pcre2_match()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What happens
when a partial match is identified depends on which of the
two partial matching options is set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned
as soon as a partial match is found, without continuing to
search for possible complete matches. This option is
&quot;hard&quot; because it prefers an earlier partial match
over a later complete match. For this reason, the assumption
is made that the end of the supplied subject string is not
the true end of the available data, which is why \z, \Z, \b,
\B, and $ always give a partial match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, the partial match is remembered,
but matching continues as normal, and other alternatives in
the pattern are tried. If no complete match can be found,
PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned instead of
PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH. This option is &quot;soft&quot; because
it prefers a complete match over a partial match. All the
various matching items in a pattern behave as if the subject
string is potentially complete; \z, \Z, and $ match at the
end of the subject, as normal, and for \b and \B the end of
the subject is treated as a non-alphanumeric.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The difference
between the two partial matching options can be illustrated
by a pattern such as:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/dog(sbody)?/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This matches
either &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;dogsbody&quot;, greedily
(that is, it prefers the longer string if possible). If it
is matched against the string &quot;dog&quot; with
PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT, it yields a complete match for
&quot;dog&quot;. However, if PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, the
result is PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL. On the other hand, if the
pattern is made ungreedy the result is different:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/dog(sbody)??/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case
the result is always a complete match because that is found
first, and matching never continues after finding a complete
match. It might be easier to follow this explanation by
thinking of the two patterns like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/dog(sbody)?/
is the same as /dogsbody|dog/ <br>
/dog(sbody)??/ is the same as /dog|dogsbody/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
pattern will never match &quot;dogsbody&quot;, because it
will always find the shorter match first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example of
partial matching using pcre2test</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre2test</b> data modifiers <b>partial_hard</b> (or
<b>ph</b>) and <b>partial_soft</b> (or <b>ps</b>) set
PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD and PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT, respectively,
when calling <b>pcre2_match()</b>. Here is a run of
<b>pcre2test</b> using a pattern that matches the whole
subject in the form of a date:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
<br>
data&gt; 25dec3\=ph <br>
Partial match: 23dec3 <br>
data&gt; 3ju\=ph <br>
Partial match: 3ju <br>
data&gt; 3juj\=ph <br>
No match</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
gives the same results for both hard and soft partial
matching options. Here is an example where there is a
difference:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
<br>
data&gt; 25jun04\=ps <br>
0: 25jun04 <br>
1: jun <br>
data&gt; 25jun04\=ph <br>
Partial match: 25jun04</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With
PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT, the subject is matched completely. For
PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD, however, the subject is assumed not to
be complete, so there is only a partial match.</p>

<h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_match()
<a name="MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_match()"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE was not
originally designed with multi-segment matching in mind.
However, over time, features (including partial matching)
that make multi-segment matching possible have been added. A
very long string can be searched segment by segment by
calling <b>pcre2_match()</b> repeatedly, with the aim of
achieving the same results that would happen if the entire
string was available for searching all the time. Normally,
the strings that are being sought are much shorter than each
individual segment, and are in the middle of very long
strings, so the pattern is normally not anchored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Special logic
must be implemented to handle a matched substring that spans
a segment boundary. PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD should be used,
because it returns a partial match at the end of a segment
whenever there is the possibility of changing the match by
adding more characters. The PCRE2_NOTBOL option should also
be set for all but the first segment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a partial
match occurs, the next segment must be added to the current
subject and the match re-run, using the <i>startoffset</i>
argument of <b>pcre2_match()</b> to begin at the point where
the partial match started. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d/
<br>
data&gt; ...the date is 23ja\=ph <br>
Partial match: 23ja <br>
data&gt; ...the date is 23jan19 and on that
day...\=offset=15 <br>
0: 23jan19 <br>
1: jan</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note the use of
the <b>offset</b> modifier to start the new match where the
partial match was found. In this example, the next segment
was added to the one in which the partial match was found.
This is the most straightforward approach, typically using a
memory buffer that is twice the size of each segment. After
a partial match, the first half of the buffer is discarded,
the second half is moved to the start of the buffer, and a
new segment is added before repeating the match as in the
example above. After a no match, the entire buffer can be
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there are
memory constraints, you may want to discard text that
precedes a partial match before adding the next segment.
Unfortunately, this is not at present straightforward. In
cases such as the above, where the pattern does not contain
any lookbehinds, it is sufficient to retain only the
partially matched substring. However, if the pattern
contains a lookbehind assertion, characters that precede the
start of the partial match may have been inspected during
the matching process. When <b>pcre2test</b> displays a
partial match, it indicates these characters with
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; if the <b>allusedtext</b> modifier is
set:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
&quot;(?&lt;=123)abc&quot; <br>
data&gt; xx123ab\=ph,allusedtext <br>
Partial match: 123ab <br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
<b>allusedtext</b> modifier is not available for JIT
matching, because JIT matching does not record the first (or
last) consulted characters. For this reason, this
information is not available via the API. It is therefore
not possible in general to obtain the exact number of
characters that must be retained in order to get the right
match result. If you cannot retain the entire segment, you
must find some heuristic way of choosing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you know the
approximate length of the matching substrings, you can use
that to decide how much text to retain. The only lookbehind
information that is currently available via the API is the
length of the longest individual lookbehind in a pattern,
but this can be misleading if there are nested lookbehinds.
The value returned by calling <b>pcre2_pattern_info()</b>
with the PCRE2_INFO_MAXLOOKBEHIND option is the maximum
number of characters (not code units) that any individual
lookbehind moves back when it is processed. A pattern such
as &quot;(?&lt;=(?&lt;!b)a)&quot; has a maximum lookbehind
value of one, but inspects two characters before its
starting point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a non-UTF or
a 32-bit case, moving back is just a subtraction, but in
UTF-8 or UTF-16 you have to count characters while moving
back through the code units.</p>

<h2>PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_dfa_match()
<a name="PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_dfa_match()"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DFA
function moves along the subject string character by
character, without backtracking, searching for all possible
matches simultaneously. If the end of the subject is reached
before the end of the pattern, there is the possibility of a
partial match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned
only if there have been no complete matches. Otherwise, the
complete matches are returned. If PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set,
a partial match takes precedence over any complete matches.
The portion of the string that was matched when the longest
partial match was found is set as the first matching
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the DFA
function always searches for all possible matches, and there
is no difference between greedy and ungreedy repetition, its
behaviour is different from the <b>pcre2_match()</b>.
Consider the string &quot;dog&quot; matched against this
ungreedy pattern:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/dog(sbody)??/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whereas the
standard function stops as soon as it finds the complete
match for &quot;dog&quot;, the DFA function also finds the
partial match for &quot;dogsbody&quot;, and so returns that
when PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set.</p>

<h2>MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_dfa_match()
<a name="MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_dfa_match()"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a partial
match has been found using the DFA matching function, it is
possible to continue the match by providing additional
subject data and calling the function again with the same
compiled regular expression, this time setting the
PCRE2_DFA_RESTART option. You must pass the same working
space as before, because this is where details of the
previous partial match are stored. You can set the
PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT or PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD options with
PCRE2_DFA_RESTART to continue partial matching over multiple
segments. Here is an example using <b>pcre2test</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">re&gt;
/^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
<br>
data&gt; 23ja\=dfa,ps <br>
Partial match: 23ja <br>
data&gt; n05\=dfa,dfa_restart <br>
0: n05</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first call
has &quot;23ja&quot; as the subject, and requests partial
matching; the second call has &quot;n05&quot; as the subject
for the continued (restarted) match. Notice that when the
match is complete, only the last part is shown; PCRE2 does
not retain the previously partially-matched string. It is up
to the calling program to do that if it needs to. This means
that, for an unanchored pattern, if a continued match fails,
it is not possible to try again at a new starting point. All
this facility is capable of doing is continuing with the
previous match attempt. For example, consider this
pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1234|3789</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the first
part of the subject is &quot;ABC123&quot;, a partial match
of the first alternative is found at offset 3. There is no
partial match for the second alternative, because such a
match does not start at the same point in the subject
string. Attempting to continue with the string
&quot;7890&quot; does not yield a match because only those
alternatives that match at one point in the subject are
remembered. Depending on the application, this may or may
not be what you want.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you do want
to allow for starting again at the next character, one way
of doing it is to retain some or all of the segment and try
a new complete match, as described for <b>pcre2_match()</b>
above. Another possibility is to work with two buffers. If a
partial match at offset <i>n</i> in the first buffer is
followed by &quot;no match&quot; when PCRE2_DFA_RESTART is
used on the second buffer, you can then try a new match
starting at offset <i>n+1</i> in the first buffer.</p>
