<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Time::Duration
&minus; rounded or exact English expression of durations</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example use in
a program that ends by noting its runtime:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $start_time
= time(); <br>
use Time::Duration; <br>
# then things that take all that time, and then ends: <br>
print &quot;Runtime &quot;, duration(time() &minus;
$start_time), &quot;.\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example use in
a program that reports age of a file:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
Time::Duration; <br>
my $file = 'that_file'; <br>
my $age = $^T &minus; (stat($file))[9]; # 9 = modtime <br>
print &quot;$file was modified &quot;, ago($age);</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
provides functions for expressing durations in rounded or
exact terms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
example in the Synopsis, using
duration($interval_seconds):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;time() &minus; $start_time&quot; is 3 seconds, this
prints &quot;Runtime: <b>3 seconds</b>.&quot;. If it&rsquo;s
0 seconds, it&rsquo;s &quot;Runtime: <b>0
seconds</b>.&quot;. If it&rsquo;s 1 second, it&rsquo;s
&quot;Runtime: <b>1 second</b>.&quot;. If it&rsquo;s 125
seconds, you get &quot;Runtime: <b>2 minutes and 5
seconds</b>.&quot;. If it&rsquo;s 3820 seconds (which is
exactly 1h, 3m, 40s), you get it rounded to fit within two
expressed units: &quot;Runtime: <b>1 hour and 4
minutes</b>.&quot;. Using duration_exact instead would
return &quot;Runtime: <b>1 hour, 3 minutes, and 40
seconds</b>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the second
example in the Synopsis, using ago($interval_seconds):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the $age is
3 seconds, this prints &quot;<i>file</i> was modified <b>3
seconds ago</b>&quot;. If it&rsquo;s 0 seconds, it&rsquo;s
&quot;<i>file</i> was modified <b>just now</b>&quot;, as a
special case. If it&rsquo;s 1 second, it&rsquo;s &quot;from
<b>1 second ago</b>&quot;. If it&rsquo;s 125 seconds, you
get &quot;<i>file</i> was modified <b>2 minutes and 5
seconds ago</b>&quot;. If it&rsquo;s 3820 seconds (which is
exactly 1h, 3m, 40s), you get it rounded to fit within two
expressed units: &quot;<i>file</i> was modified <b>1 hour
and 4 minutes ago</b>&quot;. Using ago_exact instead would
return &quot;<i>file</i> was modified <b>1 hour, 3 minutes,
and 40 seconds ago</b>&quot;. And if the file&rsquo;s
modtime is, surprisingly, three seconds into the future,
$age is &minus;3, and you&rsquo;ll get the equally and
appropriately surprising &quot;<i>file</i> was modified <b>3
seconds from now</b>.&quot;</p>

<h2>MILLISECOND MODE
<a name="MILLISECOND MODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
this module assumes input is an integer representing number
of seconds and only emits results based on the integer part
of any floating-point values passed to it. However, if you
set the variable $Time::Duration::MILLISECOND to any true
value, then the methods will interpret inputs as
floating-point numbers and will emit results containing
information about the number of milliseconds in the
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
&quot;duration(1.021)&quot; will return <b>1 second and 21
milliseconds</b> in this mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Millisecond
mode is not enabled by default because this module sees
heavy use and existing users of it may be relying on its
implicit truncation of non-integer arguments.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
provides all the following functions, which are all exported
by default when you call &quot;use Time::Duration;&quot;.
<br>
duration($seconds) <br>
duration($seconds, $precision)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns English text expressing
the approximate time duration of abs($seconds), with at most
&quot;$precision&Acirc;&nbsp;||&Acirc;&nbsp;2&quot;
expressed units. (That is, duration($seconds) is the same as
duration($seconds,2).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
duration(120) or duration(&minus;120) is &quot;2
minutes&quot;. And <b>duration</b>(0) is &quot;0
seconds&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The precision
figure means that no more than that many units will be used
in expressing the time duration. For example, 31,629,659
seconds is a duration of <i>exactly</i> 1 year, 1 day, 2
hours, and 59 seconds (assuming 1 year = exactly 365 days,
as we do assume in this module). However, if you wanted an
approximation of this to at most two expressed (i.e.,
nonzero) units, it would round it and truncate it to &quot;1
year and 1 day&quot;. Max of 3 expressed units would get you
&quot;1 year, 1 day, and 2 hours&quot;. Max of 4 expressed
units would get you &quot;1 year, 1 day, 2 hours, and 59
seconds&quot;, which happens to be exactly true. Max of 5
(or more) expressed units would get you the same, since
there are only four nonzero units possible in for that
duration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">duration_exact($seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as duration($seconds),
except that the returned value is an exact (unrounded)
expression of $seconds. For example,
duration_exact(31629659) returns &quot;1 year, 1 day, 2
hours, and 59 seconds later&quot;, which is <i>exactly</i>
true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ago($seconds) <br>
ago($seconds, $precision)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For a positive value of
seconds, this prints the same as &quot;duration($seconds,
[$precision]) . '&Acirc;&nbsp;ago'&quot;. For example,
ago(120) is &quot;2 minutes ago&quot;. For a negative value
of seconds, this prints the same as &quot;duration($seconds,
[$precision]) . '&Acirc;&nbsp;from&Acirc;&nbsp;now'&quot;.
For example, ago(&minus;120) is &quot;2 minutes from
now&quot;. As a special case, <b>ago</b>(0) returns
&quot;right now&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ago_exact($seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as ago($seconds), except
that the returned value is an exact (unrounded) expression
of $seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">from_now($seconds) <br>
from_now($seconds, $precision) <br>
from_now_exact($seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The same as
ago(&minus;$seconds), ago(&minus;$seconds, $precision),
ago_exact(&minus;$seconds). For example, from_now(120) is
&quot;2 minutes from now&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">later($seconds) <br>
later($seconds, $precision)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For a positive value of
seconds, this prints the same as &quot;duration($seconds,
[$precision]) . '&Acirc;&nbsp;later'&quot;. For example,
ago(120) is &quot;2 minutes later&quot;. For a negative
value of seconds, this prints the same as
&quot;duration($seconds, [$precision]) .
'&Acirc;&nbsp;earlier'&quot;. For example, later(&minus;120)
is &quot;2 minutes earlier&quot;. As a special case,
<b>later</b>(0) returns &quot;right then&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">later_exact($seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as later($seconds), except
that the returned value is an exact (unrounded) expression
of $seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">earlier($seconds) <br>
earlier($seconds, $precision) <br>
earlier_exact($seconds)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The same as
later(&minus;$seconds), later(&minus;$seconds, $precision),
later_exact(&minus;$seconds). For example, earlier(120) is
&quot;2 minutes earlier&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">concise( <i>function(</i> ... )
)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Concise takes the string output
of one of the above functions and makes it more concise. For
example, &quot;ago(4567)&quot; returns &quot;1 hour and 16
minutes ago&quot;, but &quot;concise(ago(4567))&quot;
returns &quot;1h16m ago&quot;.</p>

<h2>I18N/L10N NOTES
<a name="I18N/L10N NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Little of the
internals of this module are English-specific. See source
and/or contact me if you&rsquo;re interested in making a
localized version for some other language than English.</p>

<h2>BACKSTORY
<a name="BACKSTORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I wrote the
basic &quot;ago()&quot; function for use in Infobot
(&quot;http://www.infobot.org&quot;), because I was tired of
this sort of response from the Purl Infobot:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">me&gt; Purl,
seen Woozle? <br>
&lt;Purl&gt; Woozle was last seen on #perl 20 days, 7 hours,
32 minutes <br>
and 40 seconds ago, saying: Wuzzle!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I figured if it
was 20 days ago, I don&rsquo;t care about the seconds. So
once I had written &quot;ago()&quot;, I abstracted the code
a bit and got all the other functions.</p>

<h2>CAVEAT
<a name="CAVEAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
calls a durational &quot;year&quot; an interval of exactly
365 days of exactly 24 hours each, with no provision for
leap years or monkey business with 23/25 hour days (much
less leap seconds!). But since the main work of this module
is approximation, that shouldn&rsquo;t be a great problem
for most purposes.</p>

<h2>SEE ALSO
<a name="SEE ALSO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Time::Elapsed
&minus; similarly converts durations to natural language,
but in addition to English also supports Danish, German,
French, and Turkish.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date::Interval,
which is similarly named, but does something rather
different.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Star Trek:
The Next Generation</i> (1987&minus;1994), where the
character Data would express time durations like &quot;1
year, 20 days, 22 hours, 59 minutes, and 35 seconds&quot;
instead of rounding to &quot;1 year and 21 days&quot;. This
is because no-one ever told him to use Time::Duration.</p>
