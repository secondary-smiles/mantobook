<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&rsquo;taint&rsquo;
mode</b> <br>
When &quot;use re 'taint'&quot; is in effect, and a tainted
string is the target of a regexp, the regexp memories (or
values returned by the m// operator in list context) are
tainted. This feature is useful when regexp operations on
tainted data aren&rsquo;t meant to extract safe substrings,
but to perform other transformations.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&rsquo;eval&rsquo;
mode</b> <br>
When &quot;use re 'eval'&quot; is in effect, a regexp is
allowed to contain &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width
assertions and &quot;(??{ ... })&quot; postponed
subexpressions that are derived from variable interpolation,
rather than appearing literally within the regexp. That is
normally disallowed, since it is a potential security risk.
Note that this pragma is ignored when the regular expression
is obtained from tainted data, i.e. evaluation is always
disallowed with tainted regular expressions. See &quot;(?{
code })&quot; in perlre and &quot;(??{ code })&quot; in
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the purpose
of this pragma, interpolation of precompiled regular
expressions (i.e., the result of &quot;qr//&quot;) is
<i>not</i> considered variable interpolation. Thus:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/foo${pat}bar/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>is</i>
allowed if $pat is a precompiled regular expression, even if
$pat contains &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; assertions or
&quot;(??{ ... })&quot; subexpressions.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&rsquo;strict&rsquo;
mode</b> <br>
Note that this is an experimental feature which may be
changed or removed in a future Perl release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When &quot;use
re 'strict'&quot; is in effect, stricter checks are applied
than otherwise when compiling regular expressions patterns.
These may cause more warnings to be raised than otherwise,
and more things to be fatal instead of just warnings. The
purpose of this is to find and report at compile time some
things, which may be legal, but have a reasonable
possibility of not being the programmer&rsquo;s actual
intent. This automatically turns on the &quot;regexp&quot;
warnings category (if not already on) within its scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an example
of something that is caught under &quot;&quot;strict'&quot;,
but not otherwise, is the pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">qr/\xABC/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;\x&quot; construct without curly braces should be
followed by exactly two hex digits; this one is followed by
three. This currently evaluates as equivalent to</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">qr/\x{AB}C/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">that is, the
character whose code point value is 0xAB, followed by the
letter &quot;C&quot;. But since &quot;C&quot; is a hex
digit, there is a reasonable chance that the intent was</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">qr/\x{ABC}/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">that is the
single character at 0xABC. Under 'strict' it is an error to
not follow &quot;\x&quot; with exactly two hex digits. When
not under 'strict' a warning is generated if there is only
one hex digit, and no warning is raised if there are more
than two.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is expected
that what exactly 'strict' does will evolve over time as we
gain experience with it. This means that programs that
compile under it in today&rsquo;s Perl may not compile, or
may have more or fewer warnings, in future Perls. There is
no backwards compatibility promises with regards to it. Also
there are already proposals for an alternate syntax for
enabling it. For these reasons, using it will raise a
&quot;experimental::re_strict&quot; class warning, unless
that category is turned off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if a
pattern compiled within 'strict' is recompiled, say by
interpolating into another pattern, outside of 'strict', it
is not checked again for strictness. This is because if it
works under strict it must work under non-strict.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&rsquo;/flags&rsquo;
mode</b> <br>
When &quot;use re '/<i>flags</i>'&quot; is specified, the
given <i>flags</i> are automatically added to every regular
expression till the end of the lexical scope. <i>flags</i>
can be any combination of 'a', 'aa', 'd', 'i', 'l', 'm',
'n', 'p', 's', 'u', 'x', and/or 'xx'.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;no re
'/<i>flags</i>'&quot; will turn off the effect of &quot;use
re '/<i>flags</i>'&quot; for the given flags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you want all your regular expressions to have /msxx on by
default, simply put</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use re
'/msxx';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">at the top of
your code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The character
set &quot;/adul&quot; flags cancel each other out. So, in
this example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use re
&quot;/u&quot;; <br>
&quot;ss&quot; =~ /\xdf/; <br>
use re &quot;/d&quot;; <br>
&quot;ss&quot; =~ /\xdf/;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the second
&quot;use re&quot; does an implicit &quot;no re
'/u'&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use re
&quot;/xx&quot;; # Doubled&minus;x <br>
... <br>
use re &quot;/x&quot;; # Single x from here on <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Turning on one
of the character set flags with &quot;use re&quot; takes
precedence over the &quot;locale&quot; pragma and the
&rsquo;unicode_strings&rsquo; &quot;feature&quot;, for
regular expressions. Turning off one of these flags when it
is active reverts to the behaviour specified by whatever
other pragmata are in scope. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use feature
&quot;unicode_strings&quot;; <br>
no re &quot;/u&quot;; # does nothing <br>
use re &quot;/l&quot;; <br>
no re &quot;/l&quot;; # reverts to unicode_strings
behaviour</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&rsquo;debug&rsquo;
mode</b> <br>
When &quot;use re 'debug'&quot; is in effect, perl emits
debugging messages when compiling and using regular
expressions. The output is the same as that obtained by
running a &quot;&minus;DDEBUGGING&quot;&minus;enabled perl
interpreter with the <b>&minus;Dr</b> switch. It may be
quite voluminous depending on the complexity of the match.
Using &quot;debugcolor&quot; instead of &quot;debug&quot;
enables a form of output that can be used to get a colorful
display on terminals that understand termcap color
sequences. Set $ENV{PERL_RE_TC} to a comma-separated list of
&quot;termcap&quot; properties to use for highlighting
strings on/off, pre-point part on/off. See &quot;Debugging
Regular Expressions&quot; in perldebug for additional
info.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE</small></b>
that the exact format of the &quot;debug&quot; mode is
<b><small>NOT</small></b> considered to be an officially
supported <small>API</small> of Perl. It is intended for
debugging only and may change as the core development team
deems appropriate without notice or deprecation in any
release of Perl, major or minor. Any documentation of the
output is purely advisory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of 5.9.5 the
directive &quot;use re 'debug'&quot; and its equivalents are
lexically scoped, as the other directives are. However they
have both compile-time and run-time effects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Pragmatic Modules&quot; in perlmodlib.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&rsquo;Debug&rsquo;
mode</b> <br>
Similarly &quot;use re 'Debug'&quot; produces debugging
output, the difference being that it allows the fine tuning
of what debugging output will be emitted. Options are
divided into three groups, those related to compilation,
those related to execution and those related to special
purposes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE</small></b>
that the options provided under the &quot;Debug&quot; mode
and the exact format of the output they create is
<b><small>NOT</small></b> considered to be an officially
supported <small>API</small> of Perl. It is intended for
debugging only and may change as the core development team
deems appropriate without notice or deprecation in any
release of Perl, major or minor. Any documentation of the
format or options available is advisory only and is subject
to change without notice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The options are
as follows: <br>
Compile related options</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>COMPILE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Turns on all non-extra compile
related debug options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>PARSE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Turns on debug output related
to the process of parsing the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>OPTIMISE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Enables output related to the
optimisation phase of compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>TRIEC</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Detailed info about trie
compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>DUMP</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Dump the final program out
after it is compiled and optimised.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>FLAGS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Dump the flags associated with
the program</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>TEST</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Print output intended for
testing the internals of the compile process</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Execute related options</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>EXECUTE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Turns on all non-extra execute
related debug options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>MATCH</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Turns on debugging of the main
matching loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>TRIEE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Extra debugging of how tries
execute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>INTUIT</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Enable debugging of start-point
optimisations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Extra debugging options</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>EXTRA</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Turns on all &quot;extra&quot;
debugging options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>BUFFERS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Enable debugging the capture
group storage during match. Warning, this can potentially
produce extremely large output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>TRIEM</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Enable enhanced
<small>TRIE</small> debugging. Enhances both
<small>TRIEE</small> and <small>TRIEC.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>STATE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Enable debugging of states in
the engine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>STACK</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Enable debugging of the
recursion stack in the engine. Enabling or disabling this
option automatically does the same for debugging states as
well. This output from this can be quite large.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>GPOS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Enable debugging of the \G
modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>OPTIMISEM</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Enable enhanced optimisation
debugging and start-point optimisations. Probably not useful
except when debugging the regexp engine itself.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>DUMP_PRE_OPTIMIZE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Enable the dumping of the
compiled pattern before the optimization phase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>WILDCARD</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">When Perl encounters a wildcard
subpattern, (see &quot;Wildcards in Property Values&quot; in
perlunicode), it suspends compilation of the main pattern,
compiles the subpattern, and then matches that against all
legal possibilities to determine the actual code points the
subpattern matches. After that it adds these to the main
pattern, and continues its compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">You may very
well want to see how your subpattern gets compiled, but it
is likely of less use to you to see how Perl matches that
against all the legal possibilities, as that is under
control of Perl, not you. Therefore, the debugging
information of the compilation portion is as specified by
the other options, but the debugging output of the matching
portion is normally suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">You can use the
<small>WILDCARD</small> option to enable the debugging
output of this subpattern matching. Careful! This can lead
to voluminous outputs, and it may not make much sense to you
what and why Perl is doing what it is. But it may be helpful
to you to see why things aren&rsquo;t going the way you
expect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
option alone doesn&rsquo;t cause any debugging information
to be output. What it does is stop the normal suppression of
execution-related debugging information during the matching
portion of the compilation of wildcards. You also have to
specify which execution debugging information you want, such
as by also including the <small>EXECUTE</small> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Other useful flags</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of 5.9.5 the
directive &quot;use re 'debug'&quot; and its equivalents are
lexically scoped, as are the other directives. However they
have both compile-time and run-time effects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Exportable
Functions</b> <br>
As of perl 5.9.5 &rsquo;re&rsquo; debug contains a number of
utility functions that may be optionally exported into the
caller&rsquo;s namespace. They are listed below. <br>
is_regexp($ref)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns true if the argument is
a compiled regular expression as returned by
&quot;qr//&quot;, false if it is not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This function
will not be confused by overloading or blessing. In
internals terms, this extracts the regexp pointer out of the
PERL_MAGIC_qr structure so it cannot be fooled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regexp_pattern($ref)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the argument is a compiled
regular expression as returned by &quot;qr//&quot;, then
this function returns the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In list context
it returns a two element list, the first element containing
the pattern and the second containing the modifiers used
when the pattern was compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">my ($pat,
$mods) = regexp_pattern($ref);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In scalar
context it returns the same as perl would when stringifying
a raw &quot;qr//&quot; with the same pattern inside. If the
argument is not a compiled reference then this routine
returns false but defined in scalar context, and the empty
list in list context. Thus the following</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if
(regexp_pattern($ref) eq '(?^i:foo)')</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">will be warning
free regardless of what $ref actually is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Like
&quot;is_regexp&quot; this function will not be confused by
overloading or blessing of the object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regname($name,$all)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns the contents of a named
buffer of the last successful match. If $all is true, then
returns an array ref containing one entry per buffer,
otherwise returns the first defined buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regnames($all)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns a list of all of the
named buffers defined in the last successful match. If $all
is true, then it returns all names defined, if not it
returns only names which were involved in the match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>regnames_count()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns the number of distinct
names defined in the pattern used for the last successful
match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note:</b>
this result is always the actual number of distinct named
buffers defined, it may not actually match that which is
returned by &quot;regnames()&quot; and related routines when
those routines have not been called with the $all parameter
set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regmust($ref)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the argument is a compiled
regular expression as returned by &quot;qr//&quot;, then
this function returns what the optimiser considers to be the
longest anchored fixed string and longest floating fixed
string in the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A <i>fixed
string</i> is defined as being a substring that must appear
for the pattern to match. An <i>anchored fixed string</i> is
a fixed string that must appear at a particular offset from
the beginning of the match. A <i>floating fixed string</i>
is defined as a fixed string that can appear at any point in
a range of positions relative to the start of the match. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">my $qr =
qr/here .* there/x; <br>
my ($anchored, $floating) = regmust($qr); <br>
print
&quot;anchored:'$anchored'\nfloating:'$floating'\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">results in</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">anchored:'here'
<br>
floating:'there'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
&quot;here&quot; is before the &quot;.*&quot; in the
pattern, its position can be determined exactly.
That&rsquo;s not true, however, for the &quot;there&quot;;
it could appear at any point after where the anchored string
appeared. Perl uses both for its optimisations, preferring
the longer, or, if they are equal, the floating.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE:</small></b>
This may not necessarily be the definitive longest anchored
and floating string. This will be what the optimiser of the
Perl that you are using thinks is the longest. If you
believe that the result is wrong please report it via the
perlbug utility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">optimization($ref)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the argument is a compiled
regular expression as returned by &quot;qr//&quot;, then
this function returns a hashref of the optimization
information discovered at compile time, so we can write
tests around it. If any other argument is given, returns
&quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The hash
contents are expected to change from time to time as we
develop new ways to optimize &minus; no assumption of
stability should be made, not even between minor versions of
perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For the current
version, the hash will have the following contents: <br>
minlen</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">An integer, the least number of
characters in any string that can match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">minlenret</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">An integer, the least number of
characters that can be in $&amp; after a match. (Consider eg
&quot; /ns(?=\d)/ &quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">gofs</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">An integer, the number of
characters before &quot;pos()&quot; to start match at.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">noscan</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A boolean, &quot;TRUE&quot; to
indicate that any anchored/floating substrings found should
not be used. ( <small>CHECKME:</small> apparently this is
set for an anchored pattern with no floating substring, but
never used.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">isall</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A boolean, &quot;TRUE&quot; to
indicate that the optimizer information is all that the
regular expression contains, and thus one does not need to
enter the regexp runtime engine at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">anchor <small>SBOL</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A boolean, &quot;TRUE&quot; if
the pattern is anchored to start of string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">anchor <small>MBOL</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A boolean, &quot;TRUE&quot; if
the pattern is anchored to any start of line within the
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">anchor <small>GPOS</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A boolean, &quot;TRUE&quot; if
the pattern is anchored to the end of the previous
match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">skip</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A boolean, &quot;TRUE&quot; if
the start class can match only the first of a run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">implicit</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A boolean, &quot;TRUE&quot; if
a &quot;/.*/&quot; has been turned implicitly into a
&quot;/^.*/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">anchored/floating</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A byte string representing an
anchored or floating substring respectively that any match
must contain, or undef if no such substring was found, or if
the substring would require utf8 to represent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">anchored utf8/floating utf8</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A utf8 string representing an
anchored or floating substring respectively that any match
must contain, or undef if no such substring was found, or if
the substring contains only 7&minus;bit <small>ASCII</small>
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">anchored min offset/floating
min offset</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">An integer, the first offset in
characters from a match location at which we should look for
the corresponding substring.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">anchored max offset/floating
max offset</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">An integer, the last offset in
characters from a match location at which we should look for
the corresponding substring.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Ignored for
anchored, so may be 0 or same as min.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">anchored end shift/floating end
shift</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><small>FIXME:</small> not sure
what this is, something to do with lookbehind. regcomp.c
says: <br>
When the final pattern is compiled and the data is moved
from the <br>
scan_data_t structure into the regexp structure the
information <br>
about lookbehind is factored in, with the information that
would <br>
have been lost precalculated in the end_shift field for the
<br>
associated string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">checking</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A constant string, one of
&quot;anchored&quot;, &quot;floating&quot; or
&quot;none&quot; to indicate which substring (if any) should
be checked for first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">stclass</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">A string representation of a
character class (&quot;start class&quot;) that must be the
first character of any match.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><small>TODO:</small>
explain the representations.</p>
