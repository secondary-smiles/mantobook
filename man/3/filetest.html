<h2>NAME

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">filetest
&minus; Perl pragma to control the filetest permission
operators</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$can_perhaps_read
= &minus;r &quot;file&quot;; # use the mode bits <br>
{ <br>
use filetest 'access'; # intuit harder <br>
$can_really_read = &minus;r &quot;file&quot;; <br>
} <br>
$can_perhaps_read = &minus;r &quot;file&quot;; # use the
mode bits again</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This pragma
tells the compiler to change the behaviour of the filetest
permission operators, &quot;&minus;r&quot;
&quot;&minus;w&quot; &quot;&minus;x&quot;
&quot;&minus;R&quot; &quot;&minus;W&quot;
&quot;&minus;X&quot; (see perlfunc).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behaviour of file test operators is to use the simple mode
bits as returned by the <b>stat()</b> family of system
calls. However, many operating systems have additional
features to define more complex access rights, for example
ACLs (Access Control Lists). For such environments,
&quot;use filetest&quot; may help the permission operators
to return results more consistent with other tools.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The &quot;use
filetest&quot; or &quot;no filetest&quot; statements affect
file tests defined in their block, up to the end of the
closest enclosing block (they are lexically
block-scoped).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, only
the &quot;access&quot; sub-pragma is implemented. It enables
(or disables) the use of <b>access()</b> when available,
that is, on most <small>UNIX</small> systems and other
<small>POSIX</small> environments. See details below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Consider
this carefully</b> <br>
The <b>stat()</b> mode bits are probably right for most of
the files and directories found on your system, because few
people want to use the additional features offered by
<b>access()</b>. But you may encounter surprises if your
program runs on a system that uses ACLs, since the
<b>stat()</b> information won&rsquo;t reflect the actual
permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There may be a
slight performance decrease in the filetest operations when
the filetest pragma is in effect, because checking bits is
very cheap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, note that
using the file tests for security purposes is a lost cause
from the start: there is a window open for race conditions
(who is to say that the permissions will not change between
the test and the real operation?). Therefore if you are
serious about security, just try the real operation and test
for its success &minus; think in terms of atomic operations.
Filetests are more useful for filesystem administrative
tasks, when you have no need for the content of the elements
on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
&quot;access&quot; sub-pragma</b> <small><br>
UNIX</small> and <small>POSIX</small> systems provide an
abstract <b>access()</b> operating system call, which should
be used to query the read, write, and execute rights. This
function hides various distinct approaches in additional
operating system specific security features, like Access
Control Lists (ACLs)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The extended
filetest functionality is used by Perl only when the
argument of the operators is a filename, not when it is a
filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Limitation
with regard to &quot;_&quot;</b> <br>
Because <b>access()</b> does not invoke <b>stat()</b> (at
least not in a way visible to Perl), <b>the stat result
cache &quot;_&quot; is not set</b>. This means that the
outcome of the following two tests is different. The first
has the stat bits of <i>/etc/passwd</i> in &quot;_&quot;,
and in the second case this still contains the bits of
&quot;/etc&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">{ &minus;d
'/etc'; <br>
&minus;w '/etc/passwd'; <br>
print &minus;f _ ? 'Yes' : 'No'; # Yes <br>
} <br>
{ use filetest 'access'; <br>
&minus;d '/etc'; <br>
&minus;w '/etc/passwd'; <br>
print &minus;f _ ? 'Yes' : 'No'; # No <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of course,
unless your <small>OS</small> does not implement
<b>access()</b>, in which case the pragma is simply ignored.
Best not to use &quot;_&quot; at all in a file where the
filetest pragma is active!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a side
effect, as &quot;_&quot; doesn&rsquo;t work, stacked
filetest operators (&quot;&minus;f &minus;w $file&quot;)
won&rsquo;t work either.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This limitation
might be removed in a future version of perl.</p>
