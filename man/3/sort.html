<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sort &minus;
perl pragma to control sort() behaviour</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sort pragma
is now a no-op, and its use is discouraged. These three
operations are valid, but have no effect:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use sort
'stable'; # guarantee stability <br>
use sort 'defaults'; # revert to default behavior <br>
no sort 'stable'; # stability not important</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Historically
the &quot;sort&quot; pragma you can control the behaviour of
the builtin &quot;sort()&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to
v5.28.0 there were two other options:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use sort
'_mergesort'; <br>
use sort '_qsort'; # or '_quicksort'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you try and
specify either of these in v5.28+ it will croak.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
sort has been stable since v5.8.0, and given this consistent
behaviour for almost two decades, everyone has come to
assume stability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Stability will
remain the default &minus; hence there is no need for a
pragma for code to opt into stability &quot;just in
case&quot; this changes &minus; it won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We do not
foresee going back to offering multiple implementations of
general purpose sorting &minus; hence there is no future
need to offer a pragma to choose between them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you know
that you care that much about performance of your sorting,
and that for your use case and your data, it was worth
investigating alternatives, possible to identify an
alternative from our default that was better, and the cost
of switching was worth it, then you know more than we do.
Likely whatever choices we can give are not as good as
implementing your own. (For example, a Radix sort can be
faster than O(n log n), but can&rsquo;t be used for all keys
and has larger overheads.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We are not
averse to <b>changing</b> the sort algorithm, but we
don&rsquo;t see the benefit in offering the choice of two
general purpose implementations.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The function
&quot;sort::current()&quot; was provided to report the
current state of the sort pragmata. This function was not
exported, and there is no code to call it on
<small>CPAN.</small> It is now deprecated, and will warn by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As we no longer
store any sort &quot;state&quot;, it can no longer return
the correct value, so it will always return the string
&quot;stable&quot;, as this is consistent with what we
actually have implemented.</p>
