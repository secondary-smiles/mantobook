<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Tie::File&quot;
represents a regular text file as a Perl array. Each element
in the array corresponds to a record in the file. The first
line of the file is element 0 of the array; the second line
is element 1, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The file is
<i>not</i> loaded into memory, so this will work even for
gigantic files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Changes to the
array are reflected in the file immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lazy people and
beginners may now stop reading the manual.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;recsep&quot;</b>
<br>
What is a &rsquo;record&rsquo;? By default, the meaning is
the same as for the &quot;&lt;...&gt;&quot; operator:
It&rsquo;s a string terminated by $/, which is probably
&quot;\n&quot;. (Minor exception: on <small>DOS</small> and
Win32 systems, a &rsquo;record&rsquo; is a string terminated
by &quot;\r\n&quot;.) You may change the definition of
&quot;record&quot; by supplying the &quot;recsep&quot;
option in the &quot;tie&quot; call:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tie @array,
'Tie::File', $file, recsep =&gt; 'es';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This says that
records are delimited by the string &quot;es&quot;. If the
file contained the following data:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Curse these
pesky flies!\n</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">then the @array
would appear to have four elements:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Curse
th&quot; <br>
&quot;e p&quot; <br>
&quot;ky fli&quot; <br>
&quot;!\n&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An undefined
value is not permitted as a record separator. Perl&rsquo;s
special &quot;paragraph mode&quot; semantics (a la &quot;$/
= &quot;&quot;&quot;) are not emulated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Records read
from the tied array do not have the record separator string
on the end; this is to allow</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$array[17] .=
&quot;extra&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to work as
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(See
&quot;autochomp&quot;, below.) Records stored into the array
will have the record separator string appended before they
are written to the file, if they don&rsquo;t have one
already. For example, if the record separator string is
&quot;\n&quot;, then the following two lines do exactly the
same thing:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$array[17] =
&quot;Cherry pie&quot;; <br>
$array[17] = &quot;Cherry pie\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The result is
that the contents of line 17 of the file will be replaced
with &quot;Cherry pie&quot;; a newline character will
separate line 17 from line 18. This means that this code
will do nothing:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">chomp
$array[17];</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
&quot;chomp&quot;ed value will have the separator reattached
when it is written back to the file. There is no way to
create a file whose trailing record separator string is
missing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inserting
records that <i>contain</i> the record separator string is
not supported by this module. It will probably produce a
reasonable result, but what this result will be may change
in a future version. Use &rsquo;splice&rsquo; to insert
records or to replace one record with several.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;autochomp&quot;</b>
<br>
Normally, array elements have the record separator removed,
so that if the file contains the text</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Gold <br>
Frankincense <br>
Myrrh</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the tied array
will appear to contain &quot;(&quot;Gold&quot;,
&quot;Frankincense&quot;, &quot;Myrrh&quot;)&quot;. If you
set &quot;autochomp&quot; to a false value, the record
separator will not be removed. If the file above was tied
with</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tie @gifts,
&quot;Tie::File&quot;, $gifts, autochomp =&gt; 0;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">then the array
@gifts would appear to contain &quot;(&quot;Gold\n&quot;,
&quot;Frankincense\n&quot;, &quot;Myrrh\n&quot;)&quot;, or
(on Win32 systems) &quot;(&quot;Gold\r\n&quot;,
&quot;Frankincense\r\n&quot;,
&quot;Myrrh\r\n&quot;)&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;mode&quot;</b>
<br>
Normally, the specified file will be opened for read and
write access, and will be created if it does not exist.
(That is, the flags &quot;O_RDWR | O_CREAT&quot; are
supplied in the &quot;open&quot; call.) If you want to
change this, you may supply alternative flags in the
&quot;mode&quot; option. See Fcntl for a listing of
available flags. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># open the file
if it exists, but fail if it does not exist <br>
use Fcntl 'O_RDWR'; <br>
tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDWR; <br>
# create the file if it does not exist <br>
use Fcntl 'O_RDWR', 'O_CREAT'; <br>
tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDWR | O_CREAT;
<br>
# open an existing file in read&minus;only mode <br>
use Fcntl 'O_RDONLY'; <br>
tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, mode =&gt; O_RDONLY;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Opening the
data file in write-only or append mode is not supported.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;memory&quot;</b>
<br>
This is an upper limit on the amount of memory that
&quot;Tie::File&quot; will consume at any time while
managing the file. This is used for two things: managing the
<i>read cache</i> and managing the <i>deferred write
buffer</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Records read in
from the file are cached, to avoid having to re-read them
repeatedly. If you read the same record twice, the first
time it will be stored in memory, and the second time it
will be fetched from the <i>read cache</i>. The amount of
data in the read cache will not exceed the value you
specified for &quot;memory&quot;. If &quot;Tie::File&quot;
wants to cache a new record, but the read cache is full, it
will make room by expiring the least-recently visited
records from the read cache.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
memory limit is 2Mib. You can adjust the maximum read cache
size by supplying the &quot;memory&quot; option. The
argument is the desired cache size, in bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># I have a lot
of memory, so use a large cache to speed up access <br>
tie @array, 'Tie::File', $file, memory =&gt; 20_000_000;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setting the
memory limit to 0 will inhibit caching; records will be
fetched from disk every time you examine them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;memory&quot; value is not an absolute or exact limit
on the memory used. &quot;Tie::File&quot; objects contains
some structures besides the read cache and the deferred
write buffer, whose sizes are not charged against
&quot;memory&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The cache
itself consumes about 310 bytes per cached record, so if
your file has many short records, you may want to decrease
the cache memory limit, or else the cache overhead may
exceed the size of the cached data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;dw_size&quot;</b>
<br>
(This is an advanced feature. Skip this section on first
reading.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use
deferred writing (See &quot;Deferred Writing&quot;, below)
then data you write into the array will not be written
directly to the file; instead, it will be saved in the
<i>deferred write buffer</i> to be written out later. Data
in the deferred write buffer is also charged against the
memory limit you set with the &quot;memory&quot; option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may set the
&quot;dw_size&quot; option to limit the amount of data that
can be saved in the deferred write buffer. This limit may
not exceed the total memory limit. For example, if you set
&quot;dw_size&quot; to 1000 and &quot;memory&quot; to 2500,
that means that no more than 1000 bytes of deferred writes
will be saved up. The space available for the read cache
will vary, but it will always be at least 1500 bytes (if the
deferred write buffer is full) and it could grow as large as
2500 bytes (if the deferred write buffer is empty.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
don&rsquo;t specify a &quot;dw_size&quot;, it defaults to
the entire memory limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Option
Format</b> <br>
&quot;&minus;mode&quot; is a synonym for &quot;mode&quot;.
&quot;&minus;recsep&quot; is a synonym for
&quot;recsep&quot;. &quot;&minus;memory&quot; is a synonym
for &quot;memory&quot;. You get the idea.</p>

<h2>Public Methods
<a name="Public Methods"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;tie&quot; call returns an object, say $o. You may
call</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$rec =
$o&minus;&gt;FETCH($n); <br>
$o&minus;&gt;STORE($n, $rec);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to fetch or
store the record at line $n, respectively; similarly the
other tied array methods. (See perltie for details.) You may
also call the following methods on this object:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;flock&quot;</b>
<br>
$o&minus;&gt;flock(MODE)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will lock the
tied file. &quot;MODE&quot; has the same meaning as the
second argument to the Perl built-in &quot;flock&quot;
function; for example &quot;LOCK_SH&quot; or &quot;LOCK_EX |
LOCK_NB&quot;. (These constants are provided by the
&quot;use Fcntl ':flock'&quot; declaration.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;MODE&quot;
is optional; the default is &quot;LOCK_EX&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Tie::File&quot;
maintains an internal table of the byte offset of each
record it has seen in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you use
&quot;flock&quot; to lock the file, &quot;Tie::File&quot;
assumes that the read cache is no longer trustworthy,
because another process might have modified the file since
the last time it was read. Therefore, a successful call to
&quot;flock&quot; discards the contents of the read cache
and the internal record offset table.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Tie::File&quot;
promises that the following sequence of operations will be
safe:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $o = tie
@array, &quot;Tie::File&quot;, $filename; <br>
$o&minus;&gt;flock;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In particular,
&quot;Tie::File&quot; will <i>not</i> read or write the file
during the &quot;tie&quot; call. (Exception: Using
&quot;mode =&gt; O_TRUNC&quot; will, of course, erase the
file during the &quot;tie&quot; call. If you want to do this
safely, then open the file without &quot;O_TRUNC&quot;, lock
the file, and use &quot;@array = ()&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The best way to
unlock a file is to discard the object and untie the array.
It is probably unsafe to unlock the file without also
untying it, because if you do, changes may remain unwritten
inside the object. That is why there is no shortcut for
unlocking. If you really want to unlock the file
prematurely, you know what to do; if you don&rsquo;t know
what to do, then don&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All the usual
warnings about file locking apply here. In particular, note
that file locking in Perl is <b>advisory</b>, which means
that holding a lock will not prevent anyone else from
reading, writing, or erasing the file; it only prevents them
from getting another lock at the same time. Locks are
analogous to green traffic lights: If you have a green
light, that does not prevent the idiot coming the other way
from plowing into you sideways; it merely guarantees to you
that the idiot does not also have a green light at the same
time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;autochomp&quot;</b>
<br>
my $old_value = $o&minus;&gt;autochomp(0); # disable
autochomp option <br>
my $old_value = $o&minus;&gt;autochomp(1); # enable
autochomp option <br>
my $ac = $o&minus;&gt;autochomp(); # recover current
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;autochomp&quot;, above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;offset&quot;</b>
<br>
$off = $o&minus;&gt;offset($n);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This method
returns the byte offset of the start of the $nth record in
the file. If there is no such record, it returns an
undefined value.</p>

<h2>Tying to an already-opened filehandle
<a name="Tying to an already-opened filehandle"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If $fh is a
filehandle, such as is returned by &quot;IO::File&quot; or
one of the other &quot;IO&quot; modules, you may use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tie @array,
'Tie::File', $fh, ...;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly if
you opened that handle &quot;FH&quot; with regular
&quot;open&quot; or &quot;sysopen&quot;, you may use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tie @array,
'Tie::File', \*FH, ...;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Handles that
were opened write-only won&rsquo;t work. Handles that were
opened read-only will work as long as you don&rsquo;t try to
modify the array. Handles must be attached to seekable
sources of data&minus;&minus;&minus;that means no pipes or
sockets. If &quot;Tie::File&quot; can detect that you
supplied a non-seekable handle, the &quot;tie&quot; call
will throw an exception. (On Unix systems, it can detect
this.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
Tie::File will only close any filehandles that it opened
internally. If you passed it a filehandle as above, you
&quot;own&quot; the filehandle, and are responsible for
closing it after you have untied the @array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tie::File calls
&quot;binmode&quot; on filehandles that it opens internally,
but not on filehandles passed in by the user. For
consistency, especially if using the tied files
cross-platform, you may wish to call &quot;binmode&quot; on
the filehandle prior to tying the file.</p>

<h2>Deferred Writing
<a name="Deferred Writing"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(This is an
advanced feature. Skip this section on first reading.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally,
modifying a &quot;Tie::File&quot; array writes to the
underlying file immediately. Every assignment like
&quot;$a[3] = ...&quot; rewrites as much of the file as is
necessary; typically, everything from line 3 through the end
will need to be rewritten. This is the simplest and most
transparent behavior. Performance even for large files is
reasonably good.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, under
some circumstances, this behavior may be excessively slow.
For example, suppose you have a million-record file, and you
want to do:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for (@FILE) {
<br>
$_ = &quot;&gt; $_&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first time
through the loop, you will rewrite the entire file, from
line 0 through the end. The second time through the loop,
you will rewrite the entire file from line 1 through the
end. The third time through the loop, you will rewrite the
entire file from line 2 to the end. And so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
performance in such cases is unacceptable, you may defer the
actual writing, and then have it done all at once. The
following loop will perform much better for large files:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(tied
@a)&minus;&gt;defer; <br>
for (@a) { <br>
$_ = &quot;&gt; $_&quot;; <br>
} <br>
(tied @a)&minus;&gt;flush;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;Tie::File&quot;&rsquo;s memory limit is large enough,
all the writing will done in memory. Then, when you call
&quot;&minus;&gt;flush&quot;, the entire file will be
rewritten in a single pass.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Actually, the
preceding discussion is something of a fib. You don&rsquo;t
need to enable deferred writing to get good performance for
this common case, because &quot;Tie::File&quot; will do it
for you automatically unless you specifically tell it not
to. See &quot;Autodeferring&quot;, below.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Calling
&quot;&minus;&gt;flush&quot; returns the array to
immediate-write mode. If you wish to discard the deferred
writes, you may call &quot;&minus;&gt;discard&quot; instead
of &quot;&minus;&gt;flush&quot;. Note that in some cases,
some of the data will have been written already, and it will
be too late for &quot;&minus;&gt;discard&quot; to discard
all the changes. Support for &quot;&minus;&gt;discard&quot;
may be withdrawn in a future version of
&quot;Tie::File&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Deferred writes
are cached in memory up to the limit specified by the
&quot;dw_size&quot; option (see above). If the
deferred-write buffer is full and you try to write still
more deferred data, the buffer will be flushed. All buffered
data will be written immediately, the buffer will be
emptied, and the now-empty space will be used for future
deferred writes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
deferred-write buffer isn&rsquo;t yet full, but the total
size of the buffer and the read cache would exceed the
&quot;memory&quot; limit, the oldest records will be expired
from the read cache until the total size is under the
limit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;push&quot;,
&quot;pop&quot;, &quot;shift&quot;, &quot;unshift&quot;, and
&quot;splice&quot; cannot be deferred. When you perform one
of these operations, any deferred data is written to the
file and the operation is performed immediately. This may
change in a future version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you resize
the array with deferred writing enabled, the file will be
resized immediately, but deferred records will not be
written. This has a surprising consequence: &quot;@a =
(...)&quot; erases the file immediately, but the writing of
the actual data is deferred. This might be a bug. If it is a
bug, it will be fixed in a future version.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Autodeferring</b>
<br>
&quot;Tie::File&quot; tries to guess when deferred writing
might be helpful, and to turn it on and off
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for (@a) { <br>
$_ = &quot;&gt; $_&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this
example, only the first two assignments will be done
immediately; after this, all the changes to the file will be
deferred up to the user-specified memory limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should
usually be able to ignore this and just use the module
without thinking about deferring. However, special
applications may require fine control over which writes are
deferred, or may require that all writes be immediate. To
disable the autodeferment feature, use</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(tied
@o)&minus;&gt;autodefer(0);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">tie @array,
'Tie::File', $file, autodefer =&gt; 0;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
&quot;&minus;&gt;autodefer(1)&quot; re-enables
autodeferment, and &quot;&minus;&gt;autodefer()&quot;
recovers the current value of the autodefer setting.</p>

<h2>CONCURRENT ACCESS TO FILES
<a name="CONCURRENT ACCESS TO FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Caching and
deferred writing are inappropriate if you want the same file
to be accessed simultaneously from more than one process.
Other optimizations performed internally by this module are
also incompatible with concurrent access. A future version
of this module will support a &quot;concurrent =&gt; 1&quot;
option that enables safe concurrent access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Previous
versions of this documentation suggested using &quot;memory
=&gt; 0&quot; for safe concurrent access. This was mistaken.
Tie::File will not support safe concurrent access before
version 0.96.</p>

<p>The behavior of tied arrays is not precisely the same as
for regular arrays. For example:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># This DOES
print &quot;How unusual!&quot; <br>
undef $a[10]; print &quot;How unusual!\n&quot; if defined
$a[10];</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;undef&quot;&minus;ing
a &quot;Tie::File&quot; array element just blanks out the
corresponding record in the file. When you read it back
again, you&rsquo;ll get the empty string, so the
supposedly&minus;&quot;undef&quot;&rsquo;ed value will be
defined. Similarly, if you have &quot;autochomp&quot;
disabled, then</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># This DOES
print &quot;How unusual!&quot; if 'autochomp' is disabled
<br>
undef $a[10]; <br>
print &quot;How unusual!\n&quot; if $a[10];</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because when
&quot;autochomp&quot; is disabled, $a[10] will read back as
&quot;\n&quot; (or whatever the record separator string
is.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There are other
minor differences, particularly regarding &quot;exists&quot;
and &quot;delete&quot;, but in general, the correspondence
is extremely close.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p style="margin-top: 1em">I have supposed that since this
module is concerned with file I/O, almost all normal use of
it will be heavily I/O bound. This means that the time to
maintain complicated data structures inside the module will
be dominated by the time to actually perform the I/O. When
there was an opportunity to spend <small>CPU</small> time to
avoid doing I/O, I usually tried to take it.</p></td></tr>

<p>You might be tempted to think that deferred writing is
like transactions, with &quot;flush&quot; as
&quot;commit&quot; and &quot;discard&quot; as
&quot;rollback&quot;, but it isn&rsquo;t, so
don&rsquo;t.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>There is a large memory overhead for each record offset
and for each cache entry: about 310 bytes per cached data
record, and about 21 bytes per offset table entry.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The per-record
overhead will limit the maximum number of records you can
access per file. Note that <i>accessing</i> the length of
the array via &quot;$x = scalar @tied_file&quot; accesses
<b>all</b> records and stores their offsets. The same for
&quot;foreach (@tied_file)&quot;, even if you exit the loop
early.</p>

<h2>SUBCLASSING
<a name="SUBCLASSING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This version
promises absolutely nothing about the internals, which may
change without notice. A future version of the module will
have a well-defined and stable subclassing
<small>API.</small></p>

<h2>WHAT ABOUT &quot;DB_File&quot;?
<a name="WHAT ABOUT &quot;DB_File&quot;?"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">People
sometimes point out that DB_File will do something similar,
and ask why &quot;Tie::File&quot; module is necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are a
number of reasons that you might prefer
&quot;Tie::File&quot;. A list is available at

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Gigantic thanks
to Jarkko Hietaniemi, for agreeing to put this in the core
when I hadn&rsquo;t written it yet, and for generally being
helpful, supportive, and competent. (Usually the rule is
&quot;choose any one.&quot;) Also big thanks to Abhijit
Menon-Sen for all of the same things.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Special thanks
to Craig Berry and Peter Prymmer (for <small>VMS</small>
portability help), Randy Kobes (for Win32 portability help),
Clinton Pierce and Autrijus Tang (for heroic eleventh-hour
Win32 testing above and beyond the call of duty), Michael G
Schwern (for testing advice), and the rest of the
<small>CPAN</small> testers (for testing generally).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Special thanks
to Tels for suggesting several speed and memory
optimizations.</p>

<h2>TODO
<a name="TODO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More tests.
(Stuff I didn&rsquo;t think of yet.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Paragraph
mode?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed-length
mode. Leave-blanks mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Maybe an
autolocking mode?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For many common
uses of the module, the read cache is a liability. For
example, a program that inserts a single record, or that
scans the file once, will have a cache hit rate of zero.
This suggests a major optimization: The cache should be
initially disabled. Here&rsquo;s a hybrid approach:
Initially, the cache is disabled, but the cache code
maintains statistics about how high the hit rate would be
*if* it were enabled. When it sees the hit rate get high
enough, it enables itself. The <small>STAT</small> comments
in this code are the beginning of an implementation of
this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Record locking
with <b>fcntl()</b>? Then the module might support an undo
log and get real transactions. What a tour de force that
would be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keeping track
of the highest cached record. This would allow
reads-in-a-row to skip the cache lookup faster (if reading
from 1..N with empty cache at start, the last cached value
will be always N&minus;1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More tests.</p>
