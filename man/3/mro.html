Method Resolution Order</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use mro; #
enables next::method and friends globally <br>

default) <br>
use mro 'c3'; # enable C3 MRO for this class</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;mro&quot; namespace provides several utilities for
dealing with method resolution order and method caching in
general.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
interfaces are only available in Perl 5.9.5 and higher. See
MRO::Compat on <small>CPAN</small> for a mostly forwards
compatible implementation for older Perls.</p>

<h2>OVERVIEW
<a name="OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
possible to change the <small>MRO</small> of a given class
either by using &quot;use mro&quot; as shown in the
synopsis, or by using the &quot;mro::set_mro&quot; function
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The special
methods &quot;next::method&quot;, &quot;next::can&quot;, and
&quot;maybe::next::method&quot; are not available until this
&quot;mro&quot; module has been loaded via &quot;use&quot;
or &quot;require&quot;.</p>

<h2>The C3 MRO
<a name="The C3 MRO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the traditional Perl default <small>MRO</small> (depth first
search, called &quot;DFS&quot; here), Perl now offers the C3
<small>MRO</small> as well. Perl&rsquo;s support for C3 is
based on the work done in Stevan Little&rsquo;s module
Class::C3, and most of the C3&minus;related documentation
here is ripped directly from there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is
C3?</b> <br>
C3 is the name of an algorithm which aims to provide a sane
method resolution order under multiple inheritance. It was
first introduced in the language Dylan (see links in the
&quot; <small>SEE ALSO&quot;</small> section), and then
later adopted as the preferred <small>MRO</small> (Method
Resolution Order) for the new-style classes in Python 2.3.
Most recently it has been adopted as the
&quot;canonical&quot; <small>MRO</small> for Raku
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How does C3
work</b> <br>
C3 works by always preserving local precedence ordering.
This essentially means that no class will appear before any
of its subclasses. Take, for instance, the classic diamond
inheritance pattern:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;A&gt; <br>
/ \ <br>
&lt;B&gt; &lt;C&gt; <br>
\ / <br>
&lt;D&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
Perl 5 <small>MRO</small> would be (D, B, A, C). The result
being that <b>A</b> appears before <b>C</b>, even though
<b>C</b> is the subclass of <b>A</b>. The C3
<small>MRO</small> algorithm however, produces the following
order: (D, B, C, A), which does not have this issue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example is
fairly trivial; for more complex cases and a deeper
explanation, see the links in the &quot; <small>SEE
ALSO&quot;</small> section.</p>

<h2>Functions
<a name="Functions"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mro::get_linear_isa($classname[,
$type])</b> <br>
Returns an arrayref which is the linearized
<small>MRO</small> of the given class. Uses whichever
<small>MRO</small> is currently in effect for that class by
default, or the given <small>MRO</small> (either
&quot;c3&quot; or &quot;dfs&quot; if specified as
$type).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The linearized
<small>MRO</small> of a class is an ordered array of all of
the classes one would search when resolving a method on that
class, starting with the class itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
requested class doesn&rsquo;t yet exist, this function will
still succeed, and return &quot;[ $classname ]&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;UNIVERSAL&quot; (and any members of
&quot;UNIVERSAL&quot;&rsquo;s <small>MRO</small> ) are not
part of the <small>MRO</small> of a class, even though all
classes implicitly inherit methods from
&quot;UNIVERSAL&quot; and its parents.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mro::set_mro
($classname, $type)</b> <br>
Sets the <small>MRO</small> of the given class to the $type
argument (either &quot;c3&quot; or &quot;dfs&quot;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mro::get_mro($classname)</b>
<br>
Returns the <small>MRO</small> of the given class (either
&quot;c3&quot; or &quot;dfs&quot;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mro::get_isarev($classname)</b>
<br>
Gets the &quot;mro_isarev&quot; for this class, returned as
an arrayref of class names. These are every class that
&quot;isa&quot; the given class name, even if the isa
relationship is indirect. This is used internally by the
<small>MRO</small> code to keep track of method/MRO cache
invalidations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As with
&quot;mro::get_linear_isa&quot; above, &quot;UNIVERSAL&quot;
is special. &quot;UNIVERSAL&quot; (and parents&rsquo;)
isarev lists do not include every class in existence, even
though all classes are effectively descendants for method
inheritance purposes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mro::is_universal($classname)</b>
<br>
Returns a boolean status indicating whether or not the given
classname is either &quot;UNIVERSAL&quot; itself, or one of
&quot;UNIVERSAL&quot;&rsquo;s parents by @ISA
inheritance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any class for
which this function returns true is &quot;universal&quot; in
the sense that all classes potentially inherit methods from
it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mro::invalidate_all_method_caches()</b>
<br>
Increments &quot;PL_sub_generation&quot;, which invalidates
method caching in all packages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mro::method_changed_in($classname)</b>
<br>
Invalidates the method cache of any classes dependent on the
given class. This is not normally necessary. The only known
case where pure perl code can confuse the method cache is
when you manually install a new constant subroutine by using
a readonly scalar value, like the internals of constant do.
If you find another case, please report it so we can either
fix it or document the exception here.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mro::get_pkg_gen($classname)</b>
<br>
Returns an integer which is incremented every time a real
local method in the package $classname changes, or the local
@ISA of $classname is modified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
intended for authors of modules which do lots of class
introspection, as it allows them to very quickly check if
anything important about the local properties of a given
class have changed since the last time they looked. It does
not increment on method/@ISA changes in superclasses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
still up to you to seek out the actual changes, and there
might not actually be any. Perhaps all of the changes since
you last checked cancelled each other out and left the
package in the state it was in before.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This integer
normally starts off at a value of 1 when a package stash is
instantiated. Calling it on packages whose stashes do not
exist at all will return 0. If a package stash is completely
deleted (not a normal occurrence, but it can happen if
someone does something like &quot;undef %PkgName::&quot;),
the number will be reset to either 0 or 1, depending on how
completely the package was wiped out.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>next::method</b>
<br>
This is somewhat like &quot;SUPER&quot;, but it uses the C3
method resolution order to get better consistency in
multiple inheritance situations. Note that while inheritance
in general follows whichever <small>MRO</small> is in effect
for the given class, &quot;next::method&quot; only uses the
C3 <small>MRO.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One generally
uses it like so:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub some_method
{ <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
my $superclass_answer = $self&minus;&gt;next::method(@_);
<br>
return $superclass_answer + 1; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
don&rsquo;t (re&minus;)specify the method name. It forces
you to always use the same method name as the method you
started in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It can be
called on an object or a class, of course.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way it
resolves which actual method to call is:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>First, it determines the linearized C3
<small>MRO</small> of the object or class it is being called
on.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Then, it determines the class and method name of the
context it was invoked from.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Finally, it searches down the C3 <small>MRO</small> list
until it reaches the contextually enclosing class, then
searches further down the <small>MRO</small> list for the
next method with the same name as the contextually enclosing
method.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Failure to find
a next method will result in an exception being thrown (see
below for alternatives).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
substantially different than the behavior of
&quot;SUPER&quot; under complex multiple inheritance. (This
becomes obvious when one realizes that the common
superclasses in the C3 linearizations of a given class and
one of its parents will not always be ordered the same for
both.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Caveat</b>:
Calling &quot;next::method&quot; from methods defined
outside the class:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is an
edge case when using &quot;next::method&quot; from within a
subroutine which was created in a different module than the
one it is called from. It sounds complicated, but it really
isn&rsquo;t. Here is an example which will not work
correctly:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*Foo::foo = sub
{ (shift)&minus;&gt;next::method(@_) };</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The problem
exists because the anonymous subroutine being assigned to
the *Foo::foo glob will show up in the call stack as being
called &quot;__ANON__&quot; and not &quot;foo&quot; as you
might expect. Since &quot;next::method&quot; uses
&quot;caller&quot; to find the name of the method it was
called in, it will fail in this case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But fear not,
there&rsquo;s a simple solution. The module
&quot;Sub::Name&quot; will reach into the perl internals and
assign a name to an anonymous subroutine for you. Simply do
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use Sub::Name
'subname'; <br>
*Foo::foo = subname 'Foo::foo' =&gt; sub {
(shift)&minus;&gt;next::method(@_) };</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and things will
Just Work.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>next::can</b>
<br>
This is similar to &quot;next::method&quot;, but just
returns either a code reference or &quot;undef&quot; to
indicate that no further methods of this name exist.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>maybe::next::method</b>
<br>
In simple cases, it is equivalent to:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$self&minus;&gt;next::method(@_)
if $self&minus;&gt;next::can;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But there are
some cases where only this solution works (like &quot;goto
&amp;maybe::next::method&quot;);</p>
