<h2>NAME

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Data::Compare::Plugins
&minus; how to extend Data::Compare</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Data::Compare
natively handles several built-in data types &minus;
scalars, references to scalars, references to arrays,
references to hashes, references to subroutines, compiled
regular expressions, and globs. For objects, it tries to Do
The Right Thing and compares the underlying data type.
However, this is not always what you want. This is
especially true if you have complex objects which overload
stringification and/or numification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hence we allow
for plugins.</p>

<h2>FINDING PLUGINS
<a name="FINDING PLUGINS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Data::Compare
will try to load any module installed on your system under
the various @INC/Data/Compare/Plugins/ directories. If there
is a problem loading any of them, an appropriate warning
will be issued.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of how
we find plugins, no plugins are available when running in
&quot;taint&quot; mode.</p>

<h2>WRITING PLUGINS
<a name="WRITING PLUGINS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Internally,
plugins are &quot;require&quot;d into Data::Compare. This
means that they need to evaluate to true. We make use of
that true value. Where normally you just put:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">at the end of
an included file, you should instead ensure that you return
a reference to an array. This is treated as being true so
satisfies perl, and is a damned sight more useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside that
array should be either a description of what this plugin is
to do, or references to several arrays containing such
descriptions. A description consists of two or three items.
First a string telling us what the first data-type handled
by your plugin is. Second, (and optional, defaulting to the
same as the first) the second data-type to compare. To
handle comparisons to ordinary scalars, give the empty
string for the data-type, ie:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">['MyType', '',
sub { ...}]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Third and last,
we need a reference to the subroutine which does the
comparison. That subroutine should expect to take two
parameters, which will be of the specified type. It should
return 1 if they compare the same, or 0 if they compare
different.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be aware that
while you might give a description like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">['Type1',
'Type2', sub { ... }]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">this will
handle both comparing Type1 to Type2, and comparing Type2 to
Type1. ie, comparison is commutative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
use Data::Compare&rsquo;s own comparison function from
within your handler (to, for example, compare a data
structure that you have stored somewhere in your object)
then you will need to call it as Data::Compare::Compare.
However, you must be careful to avoid infinite recursion by
calling D::C::Compare which in turn calls back to your
handler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name of
your plugins does not matter, only that it lives in one of
those directories. Of course, giving it a sensible name
means that the usual installation mechanisms will put it in
the right place, and meaningful names will make it easier to
debug your code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For an example,
look at the plugin that handles Scalar::Properties objects,
which is distributed with Data::Compare.</p>

<h2>DISTRIBUTION
<a name="DISTRIBUTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Provided that
the above rules are followed I see no reason for you to not
upload your plugin to the <small>CPAN</small> yourself. You
will need to make Data::Compare a pre-requisite, so that the
<small>CPAN</small> .pm installer does the right thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
if you would prefer me to roll your plugin in with the
Data::Compare distribution, I&rsquo;d be happy to do so
provided that the code is clear and well-commented, and that
you include tests and documentation.</p>
