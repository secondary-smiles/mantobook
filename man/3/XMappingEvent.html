XMappingEvent &minus; MapNotify and MappingNotify event
structures</p>

<h2>STRUCTURES
<a name="STRUCTURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
for <b>MapNotify</b> events contains:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
int type; /* MapNotify */ <br>
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ <br>
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ <br>
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */ <br>
Window event; <br>
Window window; <br>
Bool override_redirect; /* boolean, is override set... */
<br>
} XMapEvent;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive this event, the structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> event to a client application, it
sends an <b>XGraphicsExposeEvent</b> structure with the type
member set to <b>GraphicsExpose</b>. The display member is
set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The
send_event member is set to <b>True</b> if the event came
from a <b>SendEvent</b> protocol request. The serial member
is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The event
member is set either to the window that was mapped or to its
parent, depending on whether <b>StructureNotify</b> or
<b>SubstructureNotify</b> was selected. The window member is
set to the window that was mapped. The override_redirect
member is set to the override-redirect attribute of the
window. Window manager clients normally should ignore this
window if the override-redirect attribute is <b>True</b>,
because these events usually are generated from pop-ups,
which override structure control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
for <b>MappingNotify</b> events is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
int type; /* MappingNotify */ <br>
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ <br>
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ <br>
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */ <br>
Window window; /* unused */ <br>
int request; /* one of MappingModifier, MappingKeyboard,
<br>
MappingPointer */ <br>
int first_keycode; /* first keycode */ <br>
int count; /* defines range of change with first_keycode*/
<br>
} XMappingEvent;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive this event, the structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> event to a client application, it

32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The request
member is set to indicate the kind of mapping change that
occurred and can be <b>MappingModifier</b>,
<b>MappingKeyboard</b>, <b>MappingPointer</b>. If it is
<b>MappingModifier</b>, the modifier mapping was changed. If
it is <b>MappingKeyboard</b>, the keyboard mapping was
changed. If it is <b>MappingPointer</b>, the pointer button
mapping was changed. The first_keycode and count members are
set only if the request member was set to
<b>MappingKeyboard</b>. The number in first_keycode
represents the first number in the range of the altered
mapping, and count represents the number of keycodes
altered.</p>
