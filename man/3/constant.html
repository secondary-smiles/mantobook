<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This pragma
allows you to declare constants at compile-time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
declare a constant such as &quot;PI&quot; using the method
shown above, each machine your script runs upon can have as
many digits of accuracy as it can use. Also, your program
will be easier to read, more likely to be maintained (and
maintained correctly), and far less likely to send a space
probe to the wrong planet because nobody noticed the one
equation in which you wrote 3.14195.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a constant
is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its value at
compile time, and may then optimize the expression further.
In particular, any code in an &quot;if (CONSTANT)&quot;
block will be optimized away if the constant is false.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As with all
&quot;use&quot; directives, defining a constant happens at
compile time. Thus, it&rsquo;s probably not correct to put a
constant declaration inside of a conditional statement (like
&quot;if ($foo) { use constant ... }&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Constants
defined using this module cannot be interpolated into
strings like variables. However, concatenation works just
fine:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Pi
equals PI...\n&quot;; # WRONG: does not expand
&quot;PI&quot; <br>
print &quot;Pi equals &quot;.PI.&quot;...\n&quot;; #
right</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even though a
reference may be declared as a constant, the reference may
point to data which may be changed, as this code shows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use constant
ARRAY =&gt; [ 1,2,3,4 ]; <br>
print ARRAY&minus;&gt;[1]; <br>
ARRAY&minus;&gt;[1] = &quot; be changed&quot;; <br>
print ARRAY&minus;&gt;[1];</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Constants
belong to the package they are defined in. To refer to a
constant defined in another package, specify the full
package name, as in &quot;Some::Package::CONSTANT&quot;.
Constants may be exported by modules, and may also be called
as either class or instance methods, that is, as
&quot;Some::Package&minus;&gt;CONSTANT&quot; or as
&quot;$obj&minus;&gt;CONSTANT&quot; where $obj is an
instance of &quot;Some::Package&quot;. Subclasses may define
their own constants to override those in their base
class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of version
1.32 of this module, constants can be defined in packages
other than the caller, by including the package name in the
name of the constant:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use constant
&quot;OtherPackage::FWIBBLE&quot; =&gt; 7865; <br>

constant&minus;&gt;import(&quot;Other::FWOBBLE&quot;,$value);
# dynamically at run time</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of all
caps for constant names is merely a convention, although it
is recommended in order to make constants stand out and to
help avoid collisions with other barewords, keywords, and
subroutine names. Constant names must begin with a letter or
underscore. Names beginning with a double underscore are
reserved. Some poor choices for names will generate
warnings, if warnings are enabled at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>List
constants</b> <br>
Constants may be lists of more (or less) than one value. A
constant with no values evaluates to &quot;undef&quot; in
scalar context. Note that constants with more than one value
do <i>not</i> return their last value in scalar context as
one might expect. They currently return the number of
values, but <b>this may change in the future</b>. Do not use
constants with multiple values in scalar context.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE:</small></b>
This implies that the expression defining the value of a
constant is evaluated in list context. This may produce
surprises:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use constant
TIMESTAMP =&gt; localtime; # WRONG! <br>
use constant TIMESTAMP =&gt; scalar localtime; # right</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first line
above defines &quot;TIMESTAMP&quot; as a 9&minus;element
list, as returned by &quot;localtime()&quot; in list
context. To set it to the string returned by
&quot;localtime()&quot; in scalar context, an explicit
&quot;scalar&quot; keyword is required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">List constants
are lists, not arrays. To index or slice them, they must be
placed in parentheses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my @workdays =
WEEKDAYS[1 .. 5]; # WRONG! <br>
my @workdays = (WEEKDAYS)[1 .. 5]; # right</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Defining
multiple constants at once</b> <br>
Instead of writing multiple &quot;use constant&quot;
statements, you may define multiple constants in a single
statement by giving, instead of the constant name, a
reference to a hash where the keys are the names of the
constants to be defined. Obviously, all constants defined
using this method must have a single value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use constant {
<br>
FOO =&gt; &quot;A single value&quot;, <br>
BAR =&gt; &quot;This&quot;, &quot;won't&quot;,
&quot;work!&quot;, # Error! <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
fundamental limitation of the way hashes are constructed in
Perl. The error messages produced when this happens will
often be quite cryptic -- in the worst case there may be
none at all, and you&rsquo;ll only later find that something
is broken.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When defining
multiple constants, you cannot use the values of other
constants defined in the same declaration. This is because
the calling package doesn&rsquo;t know about any constant
within that group until <i>after</i> the &quot;use&quot;
statement is finished.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use constant {
<br>
BITMASK =&gt; 0xAFBAEBA8, <br>
NEGMASK =&gt; ~BITMASK, # Error! <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Magic
constants</b> <br>
Magical values and references can be made into constants at
compile time, allowing for way cool stuff like this. (These
error numbers aren&rsquo;t totally portable, alas.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use constant
E2BIG =&gt; ($! = 7); <br>
print E2BIG, &quot;\n&quot;; # something like &quot;Arg list
too long&quot; <br>
print 0+E2BIG, &quot;\n&quot;; # &quot;7&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can&rsquo;t
produce a tied constant by giving a tied scalar as the
value. References to tied variables, however, can be used as
constants without any problems.</p>

<h2>TECHNICAL NOTES
<a name="TECHNICAL NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the current
implementation, scalar constants are actually inlinable
subroutines. As of version 5.004 of Perl, the appropriate
scalar constant is inserted directly in place of some
subroutine calls, thereby saving the overhead of a
subroutine call. See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in
perlsub for details about how and when this happens.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the rare
case in which you need to discover at run time whether a
particular constant has been declared via this module, you
may use this function to examine the hash
%constant::declared. If the given constant name does not
include a package name, the current package is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub declared
($) { <br>
use constant 1.01; # don't omit this! <br>
my $name = shift; <br>
$name =~ s/^::/main::/; <br>
my $pkg = caller; <br>
my $full_name = $name =~ /::/ ? $name :
&quot;${pkg}::$name&quot;; <br>
$constant::declared{$full_name}; <br>
}</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">List constants
are not inlined unless you are using Perl v5.20 or higher.
In v5.20 or higher, they are still not read-only, but that
may change in future versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
possible to have a subroutine or a keyword with the same
name as a constant in the same package. This is probably a
Good Thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A constant with
a name in the list &quot;STDIN STDOUT STDERR ARGV ARGVOUT
ENV INC SIG&quot; is not allowed anywhere but in package
&quot;main::&quot;, for technical reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike
constants in some languages, these cannot be overridden on
the command line or via environment variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can get
into trouble if you use constants in a context which
automatically quotes barewords (as is true for any
subroutine call). For example, you can&rsquo;t say
$hash{CONSTANT} because &quot;CONSTANT&quot; will be
interpreted as a string. Use $hash{CONSTANT()} or
$hash{+CONSTANT} to prevent the bareword quoting mechanism
from kicking in. Similarly, since the &quot;=&gt;&quot;
operator quotes a bareword immediately to its left, you have
to say &quot;CONSTANT() =&gt; 'value'&quot; (or simply use a
comma in place of the big arrow) instead of &quot;CONSTANT
=&gt; 'value'&quot;.</p>
