<h2>STRUCTURES
<a name="STRUCTURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
for <b>ColormapNotify</b> events contains:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
int type; /* ColormapNotify */ <br>
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ <br>
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ <br>
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */ <br>
Window window; <br>
Colormap colormap; /* colormap or None */ <br>
Bool new; <br>
int state; /* ColormapInstalled, ColormapUninstalled */ <br>
} XColormapEvent;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive this event, the structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> event to a client application, it
sends an <b>XGraphicsExposeEvent</b> structure with the type
member set to <b>GraphicsExpose</b>. The display member is
set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The
send_event member is set to <b>True</b> if the event came
from a <b>SendEvent</b> protocol request. The serial member
is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The window
member is set to the window whose associated colormap is
changed, installed, or uninstalled. For a colormap that is
changed, installed, or uninstalled, the colormap member is
set to the colormap associated with the window. For a
colormap that is changed by a call to <b>XFreeColormap</b>,
the colormap member is set to <b>None</b>. The new member is
set to indicate whether the colormap for the specified
window was changed or installed or uninstalled and can be
<b>True</b> or <b>False</b>. If it is <b>True</b>, the
colormap was changed. If it is <b>False</b>, the colormap
was installed or uninstalled. The state member is always set
to indicate whether the colormap is installed or uninstalled
and can be <b>ColormapInstalled</b> or
<b>ColormapUninstalled</b>.</p>
