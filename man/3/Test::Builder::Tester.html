<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A module that
helps you test testing modules that are built with
Test::Builder.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The testing
system is designed to be used by performing a three step
process for each test you wish to test. This process starts
with using &quot;test_out&quot; and &quot;test_err&quot; in
advance to declare what the testsuite you are testing will
output with Test::Builder to stdout and stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You then can
run the test(s) from your test suite that call
Test::Builder. At this point the output of Test::Builder is
safely captured by Test::Builder::Tester rather than being
interpreted as real test output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The final stage
is to call &quot;test_test&quot; that will simply compare
what you predeclared to what Test::Builder actually
outputted, and report the results back with a &quot;ok&quot;
or &quot;not ok&quot; (with debugging) to the normal
output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Functions</b>
<br>
These are the six methods that are exported as default. <br>
test_out <br>
test_err</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Procedures for predeclaring the
output that your test suite is expected to produce until
&quot;test_test&quot; is called. These procedures
automatically assume that each line terminates with
&quot;\n&quot;. So</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test_out(&quot;ok
1&quot;,&quot;ok 2&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">is the same
as</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test_out(&quot;ok
1\nok 2&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">which is even
the same as</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test_out(&quot;ok
1&quot;); <br>
test_out(&quot;ok 2&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Once
&quot;test_out&quot; or &quot;test_err&quot; (or
&quot;test_fail&quot; or &quot;test_diag&quot;) have been
called, all further output from Test::Builder will be
captured by Test::Builder::Tester. This means that you will
not be able perform further tests to the normal output in
the normal way until you call &quot;test_test&quot; (well,
unless you manually meddle with the output filehandles)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">test_fail</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Because the standard failure
message that Test::Builder produces whenever a test fails
will be a common occurrence in your test error output, and
because it has changed between Test::Builder versions,
rather than forcing you to call &quot;test_err&quot; with
the string all the time like so</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test_err(&quot;#
Failed test ($0 at line
&quot;.line_num(+1).&quot;)&quot;);</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;test_fail&quot;
exists as a convenience function that can be called instead.
It takes one argument, the offset from the current line that
the line that causes the fail is on.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test_fail(+1);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
the example in the synopsis could be rewritten more simply
as:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test_out(&quot;not
ok 1 &minus; foo&quot;); <br>
test_fail(+1); <br>
fail(&quot;foo&quot;); <br>
test_test(&quot;fail works&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">test_diag</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As most of the remaining
expected output to the error stream will be created by
Test::Builder&rsquo;s &quot;diag&quot; function,
Test::Builder::Tester provides a convenience function
&quot;test_diag&quot; that you can use instead of
&quot;test_err&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;test_diag&quot; function prepends comment hashes and
spacing to the start and newlines to the end of the expected
output passed to it and adds it to the list of expected
error output. So, instead of writing</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test_err(&quot;#
Couldn't open file&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">you can
write</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test_diag(&quot;Couldn't
open file&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Remember that
Test::Builder&rsquo;s diag function will not add newlines to
the end of output and test_diag will. So to check</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Test::Builder&minus;&gt;new&minus;&gt;diag(&quot;foo\n&quot;,&quot;bar\n&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You would
do</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">test_diag(&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;bar&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">without the
newlines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">test_test</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Actually performs the output
check testing the tests, comparing the data (with
&quot;eq&quot;) that we have captured from Test::Builder
against what was declared with &quot;test_out&quot; and
&quot;test_err&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This takes
name/value pairs that effect how the test is run. <br>
title (synonym &rsquo;name&rsquo;, &rsquo;label&rsquo;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The name of the test that will
be displayed after the &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;not
ok&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">skip_out</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Setting this to a true value
will cause the test to ignore if the output sent by the test
to the output stream does not match that declared with
&quot;test_out&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">skip_err</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Setting this to a true value
will cause the test to ignore if the output sent by the test
to the error stream does not match that declared with
&quot;test_err&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a
convenience, if only one argument is passed then this
argument is assumed to be the name of the test (as in the
above examples.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Once
&quot;test_test&quot; has been run test output will be
redirected back to the original filehandles that
Test::Builder was connected to (probably
<small>STDOUT</small> and <small>STDERR,</small> ) meaning
any further tests you run will function normally and cause
success/errors for Test::Harness.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">line_num</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A utility function that returns
the line number that the function was called on. You can
pass it an offset which will be added to the result. This is
very useful for working out the correct text of diagnostic
functions that contain line numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Essentially
this is the same as the &quot;__LINE__&quot; macro, but the
&quot;line_num(+3)&quot; idiom is arguably nicer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the six exported functions there exists one function that
can only be accessed with a fully qualified function call.
<br>
color</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When &quot;test_test&quot; is
called and the output that your tests generate does not
match that which you declared, &quot;test_test&quot; will
print out debug information showing the two conflicting
versions. As this output itself is debug information it can
be confusing which part of the output is from
&quot;test_test&quot; and which was the original output from
your original tests. Also, it may be hard to spot things
like extraneous whitespace at the end of lines that may
cause your test to fail even though the output looks
similar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To assist you
&quot;test_test&quot; can colour the background of the debug
information to disambiguate the different types of output.
The debug output will have its background coloured green and
red. The green part represents the text which is the same
between the executed and actual output, the red shows which
part differs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;color&quot; function determines if colouring should
occur or not. Passing it a true or false value will enable
or disable colouring respectively, and the function called
with no argument will return the current setting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To enable
colouring from the command line, you can use the
Text::Builder::Tester::Color module like so:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl
&minus;Mlib=Text::Builder::Tester::Color test.t</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Or by including
the Test::Builder::Tester::Color module directly in the
<small>PERL5LIB.</small></p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Test::Builder::Tester
does not handle plans well. It has never done anything
special with plans. This means that plans from outside
Test::Builder::Tester will effect Test::Builder::Tester,
worse plans when using Test::Builder::Tester will effect
overall testing. At this point there are no plans to fix
this bug as people have come to depend on it, and
Test::Builder::Tester is now discouraged in favor of
&quot;Test2::API::intercept()&quot;. See
&lt;https://github.com/Test&minus;More/test&minus;more/issues/667&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Calls
&quot;Test::Builder&minus;&gt;no_ending&quot; turning off
the ending tests. This is needed as otherwise it will trip
out because we&rsquo;ve run more tests than we strictly
should have and it&rsquo;ll register any failures we had
that we were testing for as real failures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The color
function doesn&rsquo;t work unless Term::ANSIColor is
compatible with your terminal. Additionally,
Win32::Console::ANSI must be installed on windows platforms
for color output.</p>
