<h2>STRUCTURES
<a name="STRUCTURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
for <b>ConfigureNotify</b> events contains:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
int type; /* ConfigureNotify */ <br>
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ <br>
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ <br>
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */ <br>
Window event; <br>
Window window; <br>
int x, y; <br>
int width, height; <br>
int border_width; <br>
Window above; <br>
Bool override_redirect; <br>
} XConfigureEvent;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive this event, the structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> event to a client application, it
sends an <b>XGraphicsExposeEvent</b> structure with the type
member set to <b>GraphicsExpose</b>. The display member is
set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The
send_event member is set to <b>True</b> if the event came
from a <b>SendEvent</b> protocol request. The serial member
is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The event
member is set either to the reconfigured window or to its
parent, depending on whether <b>StructureNotify</b> or
<b>SubstructureNotify</b> was selected. The window member is
set to the window whose size, position, border, and/or
stacking order was changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The x and y
members are set to the coordinates relative to the parent
window&rsquo;s origin and indicate the position of the
upper-left outside corner of the window. The width and
height members are set to the inside size of the window, not
including the border. The border_width member is set to the
width of the window&rsquo;s border, in pixels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The above
member is set to the sibling window and is used for stacking
operations. If the X server sets this member to <b>None</b>,
the window whose state was changed is on the bottom of the
stack with respect to sibling windows. However, if this
member is set to a sibling window, the window whose state
was changed is placed on top of this sibling window.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect
attribute of the window. Window manager clients normally
should ignore this window if the override_redirect member is
<b>True</b>.</p>
