<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenSSL
implements asynchronous capabilities through an
<b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> . This represents code that
can be started and executes until some event occurs. At that
point the code can be paused and control returns to user
code until some subsequent event indicates that the job can
be resumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The creation of
an <b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> is a relatively expensive
operation. Therefore, for efficiency reasons, jobs can be
created up front and reused many times. They are held in a
pool until they are needed, at which point they are removed
from the pool, used, and then returned to the pool when the
job completes. If the user application is multi-threaded,
then <b>ASYNC_init_thread()</b> may be called for each
thread that will initiate asynchronous jobs. Before user
code exits per-thread resources need to be cleaned up. This
will normally occur automatically (see
<b>OPENSSL_init_crypto</b>(3)) but may be explicitly
initiated by using <b>ASYNC_cleanup_thread()</b>. No
asynchronous jobs must be outstanding for the thread when
<b>ASYNC_cleanup_thread()</b> is called. Failing to ensure
this will result in memory leaks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>max_size</i> argument limits the number of
<b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> s that will be held in the
pool. If <i>max_size</i> is set to 0 then no upper limit is
set. When an <b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> is needed but
there are none available in the pool already then one will
be automatically created, as long as the total of
<b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> s managed by the pool does
not exceed <i>max_size</i>. When the pool is first
initialised <i>init_size</i> <b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b>
s will be created immediately. If <b>ASYNC_init_thread()</b>
is not called before the pool is first used then it will be
called automatically with a <i>max_size</i> of 0 (no upper
limit) and an <i>init_size</i> of 0 (no
<b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> s created up front).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An asynchronous
job is started by calling the <b>ASYNC_start_job()</b>
function. Initially <i>*job</i> should be
<small>NULL.</small> <i>ctx</i> should point to an
<b><small>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX</small></b> object created through
the <b>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new</b>(3) function. <i>ret</i> should
point to a location where the return value of the
asynchronous function should be stored on completion of the
job. <i>func</i> represents the function that should be
started asynchronously. The data pointed to by <i>args</i>
and of size <i>size</i> will be copied and then passed as an
argument to <i>func</i> when the job starts. ASYNC_start_job
will return one of the following values: <b><small><br>
ASYNC_ERR</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An error occurred trying to
start the job. Check the OpenSSL error queue (e.g. see
<b>ERR_print_errors</b>(3)) for more details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>ASYNC_NO_JOBS</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">There are no jobs currently
available in the pool. This call can be retried again at a
later time.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>ASYNC_PAUSE</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The job was successfully
started but was &quot;paused&quot; before it completed (see
<b>ASYNC_pause_job()</b> below). A handle to the job is
placed in <i>*job</i>. Other work can be performed (if
desired) and the job restarted at a later time. To restart a
job call <b>ASYNC_start_job()</b> again passing the job
handle in <i>*job</i>. The <i>func</i>, <i>args</i> and
<i>size</i> parameters will be ignored when restarting a
job. When restarting a job <b>ASYNC_start_job() must</b> be
called from the same thread that the job was originally
started from.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b><small>ASYNC_FINISH</small></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The job completed. <i>*job</i>
will be <small>NULL</small> and the return value from
<i>func</i> will be placed in <i>*ret</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At any one time
there can be a maximum of one job actively running per
thread (you can have many that are paused).
<b>ASYNC_get_current_job()</b> can be used to get a pointer
to the currently executing <b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> .
If no job is currently executing then this will return
<small>NULL.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If executing
within the context of a job (i.e. having been called
directly or indirectly by the function &quot;func&quot;
passed as an argument to <b>ASYNC_start_job()</b>) then
<b>ASYNC_pause_job()</b> will immediately return control to
the calling application with
<b><small>ASYNC_PAUSE</small></b> returned from the
<b>ASYNC_start_job()</b> call. A subsequent call to
ASYNC_start_job passing in the relevant
<b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> in the <i>*job</i> parameter
will resume execution from the <b>ASYNC_pause_job()</b>
call. If <b>ASYNC_pause_job()</b> is called whilst not
within the context of a job then no action is taken and
<b>ASYNC_pause_job()</b> returns immediately.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ASYNC_get_wait_ctx()</b>
can be used to get a pointer to the
<b><small>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX</small></b> for the <i>job</i>.
<b><small>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX</small></b> s contain two different
ways to notify applications that a job is ready to be
resumed. One is a &quot;wait&quot; file descriptor, and the
other is a &quot;callback&quot; mechanism.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;wait&quot; file descriptor associated with
<b><small>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX</small></b> is used for
applications to wait for the file descriptor to be ready for
&quot;read&quot; using a system function call such as select
or poll (being ready for &quot;read&quot; indicates that the
job should be resumed). If no file descriptor is made
available then an application will have to periodically
&quot;poll&quot; the job by attempting to restart it to see
if it is ready to continue.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX</small></b>
s also have a &quot;callback&quot; mechanism to notify
applications. The callback is set by an application, and it
will be automatically called when an engine completes a
cryptography operation, so that the application can resume
the paused work flow without polling. An engine could be
written to look whether the callback has been set. If it has
then it would use the callback mechanism in preference to
the file descriptor notifications. If a callback is not set
then the engine may use file descriptor based notifications.
Please note that not all engines may support the callback
mechanism, so the callback may not be used even if it has
been set. See <b>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX_new()</b> for more
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ASYNC_block_pause()</b> function will prevent the
currently active job from pausing. The block will remain in
place until a subsequent call to
<b>ASYNC_unblock_pause()</b>. These functions can be nested,
e.g. if you call <b>ASYNC_block_pause()</b> twice then you
must call <b>ASYNC_unblock_pause()</b> twice in order to
re-enable pausing. If these functions are called while there
is no currently active job then they have no effect. This
functionality can be useful to avoid deadlock scenarios. For
example during the execution of an
<b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> an application acquires a
lock. It then calls some cryptographic function which
invokes <b>ASYNC_pause_job()</b>. This returns control back
to the code that created the <b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b>
. If that code then attempts to acquire the same lock before
resuming the original job then a deadlock can occur. By
calling <b>ASYNC_block_pause()</b> immediately after
acquiring the lock and <b>ASYNC_unblock_pause()</b>
immediately before releasing it then this situation cannot
occur.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some platforms
cannot support async operations. The
<b>ASYNC_is_capable()</b> function can be used to detect
whether the current platform is async capable or not.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUES
<a name="RETURN VALUES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ASYNC_init_thread
returns 1 on success or 0 otherwise.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ASYNC_start_job
returns one of <b><small>ASYNC_ERR</small></b> ,
<b><small>ASYNC_NO_JOBS</small></b> ,
<b><small>ASYNC_PAUSE</small></b> or
<b><small>ASYNC_FINISH</small></b> as described above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ASYNC_pause_job
returns 0 if an error occurred or 1 on success. If called
when not within the context of an
<b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> then this is counted as
success so 1 is returned.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ASYNC_get_current_job
returns a pointer to the currently executing
<b><small>ASYNC_JOB</small></b> or <small>NULL</small> if
not within the context of a job.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ASYNC_get_wait_ctx()</b>
returns a pointer to the
<b><small>ASYNC_WAIT_CTX</small></b> for the job.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ASYNC_is_capable()</b>
returns 1 if the current platform is async capable or 0
otherwise.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On Windows
platforms the <i>&lt;openssl/async.h&gt;</i> header is
dependent on some of the types customarily made available by
including <i>&lt;windows.h&gt;</i>. The application
developer is likely to require control over when the latter
is included, commonly as one of the first included headers.
Therefore, it is defined as an application developer&rsquo;s
responsibility to include <i>&lt;windows.h&gt;</i> prior to
<i>&lt;openssl/async.h&gt;</i>.</p>
