<h2>PCRE2 MATCHING ALGORITHMS
<a name="PCRE2 MATCHING ALGORITHMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes the two different algorithms that are available in
PCRE2 for matching a compiled regular expression against a
given subject string. The &quot;standard&quot; algorithm is
the one provided by the <b>pcre2_match()</b> function. This
works in the same as as Perl&rsquo;s matching function, and
provide a Perl-compatible matching operation. The
just-in-time (JIT) optimization that is described in the
<b>pcre2jit</b> documentation is compatible with this
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
algorithm is provided by the <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>
function; it operates in a different way, and is not
Perl-compatible. This alternative has advantages and
disadvantages compared with the standard algorithm, and
these are described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When there is
only one possible way in which a given subject string can
match a pattern, the two algorithms give the same answer. A
difference arises, however, when there are multiple
possibilities. For example, if the pattern</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">^&lt;.*&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is matched
against the string</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;something&gt;
&lt;something else&gt; &lt;something further&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">there are three
possible answers. The standard algorithm finds only one of
them, whereas the alternative algorithm finds all three.</p>

<h2>REGULAR EXPRESSIONS AS TREES
<a name="REGULAR EXPRESSIONS AS TREES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The set of
strings that are matched by a regular expression can be
represented as a tree structure. An unlimited repetition in
the pattern makes the tree of infinite size, but it is still
a tree. Matching the pattern to a given subject string (from
a given starting point) can be thought of as a search of the
tree. There are two ways to search a tree: depth-first and
breadth-first, and these correspond to the two matching
algorithms provided by PCRE2.</p>

<h2>THE STANDARD MATCHING ALGORITHM
<a name="THE STANDARD MATCHING ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
terminology of Jeffrey Friedl&rsquo;s book &quot;Mastering
Regular Expressions&quot;, the standard algorithm is an
&quot;NFA algorithm&quot;. It conducts a depth-first search
of the pattern tree. That is, it proceeds along a single
path through the tree, checking that the subject matches
what is required. When there is a mismatch, the algorithm
tries any alternatives at the current point, and if they all
fail, it backs up to the previous branch point in the tree,
and tries the next alternative branch at that level. This
often involves backing up (moving to the left) in the
subject string as well. The order in which repetition
branches are tried is controlled by the greedy or ungreedy
nature of the quantifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a leaf node
is reached, a matching string has been found, and at that
point the algorithm stops. Thus, if there is more than one
possible match, this algorithm returns the first one that it
finds. Whether this is the shortest, the longest, or some
intermediate length depends on the way the alternations and
the greedy or ungreedy repetition quantifiers are specified
in the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because it ends
up with a single path through the tree, it is relatively
straightforward for this algorithm to keep track of the
substrings that are matched by portions of the pattern in
parentheses. This provides support for capturing parentheses
and backreferences.</p>

<h2>THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING ALGORITHM
<a name="THE ALTERNATIVE MATCHING ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This algorithm
conducts a breadth-first search of the tree. Starting from
the first matching point in the subject, it scans the
subject string from left to right, once, character by
character, and as it does this, it remembers all the paths
through the tree that represent valid matches. In
Friedl&rsquo;s terminology, this is a kind of &quot;DFA
algorithm&quot;, though it is not implemented as a
traditional finite state machine (it keeps multiple states
active simultaneously).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although the
general principle of this matching algorithm is that it
scans the subject string only once, without backtracking,
there is one exception: when a lookaround assertion is
encountered, the characters following or preceding the
current point have to be independently inspected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The scan
continues until either the end of the subject is reached, or
there are no more unterminated paths. At this point,
terminated paths represent the different matching
possibilities (if there are none, the match has failed).
Thus, if there is more than one possible match, this
algorithm finds all of them, and in particular, it finds the
longest. The matches are returned in the output vector in
decreasing order of length. There is an option to stop the
algorithm after the first match (which is necessarily the
shortest) is found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
size of vector needed to contain all the results depends on
the number of simultaneous matches, not on the number of
parentheses in the pattern. Using
<b>pcre2_match_data_create_from_pattern()</b> to create the
match data block is therefore not advisable when doing DFA
matching.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note also that
all the matches that are found start at the same point in
the subject. If the pattern</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cat(er(pillar)?)?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is matched
against the string &quot;the caterpillar catchment&quot;,
the result is the three strings &quot;caterpillar&quot;,
&quot;cater&quot;, and &quot;cat&quot; that start at the
fifth character of the subject. The algorithm does not
automatically move on to find matches that start at later
positions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2&rsquo;s
&quot;auto-possessification&quot; optimization usually
applies to character repeats at the end of a pattern (as
well as internally). For example, the pattern
&quot;a\d+&quot; is compiled as if it were &quot;a\d++&quot;
because there is no point even considering the possibility
of backtracking into the repeated digits. For DFA matching,
this means that only one possible match is found. If you
really do want multiple matches in such cases, either use an
ungreedy repeat (&quot;a\d+?&quot;) or set the
PCRE2_NO_AUTO_POSSESS option when compiling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are a
number of features of PCRE2 regular expressions that are not
supported or behave differently in the alternative matching
function. Those that are not supported cause an error if
encountered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. Because the
algorithm finds all possible matches, the greedy or ungreedy
nature of repetition quantifiers is not relevant (though it
may affect auto-possessification, as just described). During
matching, greedy and ungreedy quantifiers are treated in
exactly the same way. However, possessive quantifiers can
make a difference when what follows could also match what is
quantified, for example in a pattern like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">^a++\w!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This pattern
matches &quot;aaab!&quot; but not &quot;aaa!&quot;, which
would be matched by a non-possessive quantifier. Similarly,
if an atomic group is present, it is matched as if it were a
standalone pattern at the current point, and the longest
match is then &quot;locked in&quot; for the rest of the
overall pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. When dealing
with multiple paths through the tree simultaneously, it is
not straightforward to keep track of captured substrings for
the different matching possibilities, and PCRE2&rsquo;s
implementation of this algorithm does not attempt to do
this. This means that no captured substrings are
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. Because no
substrings are captured, backreferences within the pattern
are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">4. For the same
reason, conditional expressions that use a backreference as
the condition or test for a specific group recursion are not
supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5. Again for
the same reason, script runs are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">6. Because many
paths through the tree may be active, the \K escape
sequence, which resets the start of the match when
encountered (but may be on some paths and not on others), is
not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">7. Callouts are
supported, but the value of the <i>capture_top</i> field is
always 1, and the value of the <i>capture_last</i> field is
always 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">8. The \C
escape sequence, which (in the standard algorithm) always
matches a single code unit, even in a UTF mode, is not
supported in these modes, because the alternative algorithm
moves through the subject string one character (not code
unit) at a time, for all active paths through the tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">9. Except for
(*FAIL), the backtracking control verbs such as (*PRUNE) are
not supported. (*FAIL) is supported, and behaves like a
failing negative assertion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">10. The
PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF option for <b>pcre2_compile()</b> is
not supported by <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>.</p>

<h2>ADVANTAGES OF THE ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHM
<a name="ADVANTAGES OF THE ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
advantage of the alternative algorithm is that all possible
matches (at a single point in the subject) are automatically
found, and in particular, the longest match is found. To
find more than one match at the same point using the
standard algorithm, you have to do kludgy things with
callouts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Partial
matching is possible with this algorithm, though it has some
limitations. The <b>pcre2partial</b> documentation gives
details of partial matching and discusses multi-segment
matching.</p>

<h2>DISADVANTAGES OF THE ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHM
<a name="DISADVANTAGES OF THE ALTERNATIVE ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The alternative
algorithm suffers from a number of disadvantages:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. It is
substantially slower than the standard algorithm. This is
partly because it has to search for all possible matches,
but is also because it is less susceptible to
optimization.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. Capturing
parentheses, backreferences, script runs, and matching
within invalid UTF string are not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. Although
atomic groups are supported, their use does not provide the
performance advantage that it does for the standard
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">4. JIT
optimization is not supported.</p>
