<h2>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PCRE2 AND PERL
<a name="DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PCRE2 AND PERL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes some of the differences in the ways that PCRE2 and
Perl handle regular expressions. The differences described
here are with respect to Perl version 5.34.0, but as both
Perl and PCRE2 are continually changing, the information may
at times be out of date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1. When
PCRE2_DOTALL (equivalent to Perl&rsquo;s /s qualifier) is
not set, the behaviour of the &rsquo;.&rsquo; metacharacter
differs from Perl. In PCRE2, &rsquo;.&rsquo; matches the
next character unless it is the start of a newline sequence.
This means that, if the newline setting is CR, CRLF, or NUL,
&rsquo;.&rsquo; will match the code point LF (0x0A) in
ASCII/Unicode environments, and NL (either 0x15 or 0x25)
when using EBCDIC. In Perl, &rsquo;.&rsquo; appears never to
match LF, even when 0x0A is not a newline indicator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2. PCRE2 has
only a subset of Perl&rsquo;s Unicode support. Details of
what it does have are given in the <b>pcre2unicode</b>
page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">3. Like Perl,
PCRE2 allows repeat quantifiers on parenthesized assertions,
but they do not mean what you might think. For example,
(?!a){3} does not assert that the next three characters are
not &quot;a&quot;. It just asserts that the next character
is not &quot;a&quot; three times (in principle; PCRE2
optimizes this to run the assertion just once). Perl allows
some repeat quantifiers on other assertions, for example,
\b* , but these do not seem to have any use. PCRE2 does not
allow any kind of quantifier on non-lookaround
assertions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">4. Capture
groups that occur inside negative lookaround assertions are
counted, but their entries in the offsets vector are set
only when a negative assertion is a condition that has a
matching branch (that is, the condition is false). Perl may
set such capture groups in other circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5. The
following Perl escape sequences are not supported: \F, \l,
\L, \u, \U, and \N when followed by a character name. \N on
its own, matching a non-newline character, and \N{U+dd..},
matching a Unicode code point, are supported. The escapes
that modify the case of following letters are implemented by
Perl&rsquo;s general string-handling and are not part of its
pattern matching engine. If any of these are encountered by
PCRE2, an error is generated by default. However, if either
of the PCRE2_ALT_BSUX or PCRE2_EXTRA_ALT_BSUX options is
set, \U and \u are interpreted as ECMAScript interprets
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">6. The Perl
escape sequences \p, \P, and \X are supported only if PCRE2
is built with Unicode support (the default). The properties
that can be tested with \p and \P are limited to the general
category properties such as Lu and Nd, script names such as
Greek or Han, Bidi_Class, Bidi_Control, and the derived
properties Any and LC (synonym L&amp;). Both PCRE2 and Perl
support the Cs (surrogate) property, but in PCRE2 its use is
limited. See the <b>pcre2pattern</b> documentation for
details. The long synonyms for property names that Perl
supports (such as \p{Letter}) are not supported by PCRE2,
nor is it permitted to prefix any of these properties with
&quot;Is&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">7. PCRE2
supports the \Q...\E escape for quoting substrings.
Characters in between are treated as literals. However, this
is slightly different from Perl in that $ and @ are also
handled as literals inside the quotes. In Perl, they cause
variable interpolation (PCRE2 does not have variables).
Also, Perl does &quot;double-quotish backslash
interpolation&quot; on any backslashes between \Q and \E
which, its documentation says, &quot;may lead to confusing
results&quot;. PCRE2 treats a backslash between \Q and \E
just like any other character. Note the following
examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pattern PCRE2
matches Perl matches</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\Qabc$xyz\E
abc$xyz abc followed by the <br>
contents of $xyz <br>
\Qabc\$xyz\E abc\$xyz abc\$xyz <br>
\Qabc\E\$\Qxyz\E abc$xyz abc$xyz <br>
\QA\B\E A\B A\B <br>
\Q\\E \ \\E</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The \Q...\E
sequence is recognized both inside and outside character
classes by both PCRE2 and Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">8. Fairly
obviously, PCRE2 does not support the (?{code}) and
(??{code}) constructions. However, PCRE2 does have a
&quot;callout&quot; feature, which allows an external
function to be called during pattern matching. See the
<b>pcre2callout</b> documentation for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">9. Subroutine
calls (whether recursive or not) were treated as atomic
groups up to PCRE2 release 10.23, but from release 10.30
this changed, and backtracking into subroutine calls is now
supported, as in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">10. In PCRE2,
if any of the backtracking control verbs are used in a group
that is called as a subroutine (whether or not recursively),
their effect is confined to that group; it does not extend
to the surrounding pattern. This is not always the case in
Perl. In particular, if (*THEN) is present in a group that
is called as a subroutine, its action is limited to that
group, even if the group does not contain any | characters.
Note that such groups are processed as anchored at the point
where they are tested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">11. If a
pattern contains more than one backtracking control verb,
the first one that is backtracked onto acts. For example, in
the pattern A(*COMMIT)B(*PRUNE)C a failure in B triggers
(*COMMIT), but a failure in C triggers (*PRUNE).
Perl&rsquo;s behaviour is more complex; in many cases it is
the same as PCRE2, but there are cases where it differs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">12. There are
some differences that are concerned with the settings of
captured strings when part of a pattern is repeated. For
example, matching &quot;aba&quot; against the pattern
/^(a(b)?)+$/ in Perl leaves $2 unset, but in PCRE2 it is set
to &quot;b&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">13.
PCRE2&rsquo;s handling of duplicate capture group numbers
and names is not as general as Perl&rsquo;s. This is a
consequence of the fact the PCRE2 works internally just with
numbers, using an external table to translate between
numbers and names. In particular, a pattern such as
(?|(?&lt;a&gt;A)|(?&lt;b&gt;B)), where the two capture
groups have the same number but different names, is not
supported, and causes an error at compile time. If it were
allowed, it would not be possible to distinguish which group
matched, because both names map to capture group number 1.
To avoid this confusing situation, an error is given at
compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">14. Perl used
to recognize comments in some places that PCRE2 does not,
for example, between the ( and ? at the start of a group. If
the /x modifier is set, Perl allowed white space between (
and ? though the latest Perls give an error (for a while it
was just deprecated). There may still be some cases where
Perl behaves differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">15. Perl, when
in warning mode, gives warnings for character classes such
as [A-\d] or [a-[:digit:]]. It then treats the hyphens as
literals. PCRE2 has no warning features, so it gives an
error in these cases because they are almost certainly user
mistakes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">16. In PCRE2,
the upper/lower case character properties Lu and Ll are not
affected when case-independent matching is specified. For
example, \p{Lu} always matches an upper case letter. I think
Perl has changed in this respect; in the release at the time
of writing (5.34), \p{Lu} and \p{Ll} match all letters,
regardless of case, when case independence is specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">17. From
release 5.32.0, Perl locks out the use of \K in lookaround
assertions. From release 10.38 PCRE2 does the same by
default. However, there is an option for re-enabling the
previous behaviour. When this option is set, \K is acted on
when it occurs in positive assertions, but is ignored in
negative assertions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">18. PCRE2
provides some extensions to the Perl regular expression
facilities. Perl 5.10 included new features that were not in
earlier versions of Perl, some of which (such as named
parentheses) were in PCRE2 for some time before. This list
is with respect to Perl 5.34:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(a) Although
lookbehind assertions in PCRE2 must match fixed length
strings, each alternative toplevel branch of a lookbehind
assertion can match a different length of string. Perl used
to require them all to have the same length, but the latest
version has some variable length support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(b) From PCRE2
10.23, backreferences to groups of fixed length are
supported in lookbehinds, provided that there is no
possibility of referencing a non-unique number or name. Perl
does not support backreferences in lookbehinds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(c) If
PCRE2_DOLLAR_ENDONLY is set and PCRE2_MULTILINE is not set,
the $ meta-character matches only at the very end of the
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(d) A backslash
followed by a letter with no special meaning is faulted.
(Perl can be made to issue a warning.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(e) If
PCRE2_UNGREEDY is set, the greediness of the repetition
quantifiers is inverted, that is, by default they are not
greedy, but if followed by a question mark they are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(f)
PCRE2_ANCHORED can be used at matching time to force a
pattern to be tried only at the first matching position in
the subject string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(g) The
PCRE2_NOTBOL, PCRE2_NOTEOL, PCRE2_NOTEMPTY and
PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART options have no Perl equivalents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(h) The \R
escape sequence can be restricted to match only CR, LF, or
CRLF by the PCRE2_BSR_ANYCRLF option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(i) The callout
facility is PCRE2-specific. Perl supports codeblocks and
variable interpolation, but not general hooks on every
match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(j) The partial
matching facility is PCRE2-specific.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(k) The
alternative matching function (<b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>
matches in a different way and is not Perl-compatible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(l) PCRE2
recognizes some special sequences such as (*CR) or (*NO_JIT)
at the start of a pattern. These set overall options that
cannot be changed within the pattern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(m) PCRE2
supports non-atomic positive lookaround assertions. This is
an extension to the lookaround facilities. The default,
Perl-compatible lookarounds are atomic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">19. The Perl /a
modifier restricts /d numbers to pure ascii, and the /aa
modifier restricts /i case-insensitive matching to pure
ascii, ignoring Unicode rules. This separation cannot be
represented with PCRE2_UCP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">20. Perl has
different limits than PCRE2. See the <b>pcre2limit</b>
documentation for details. Perl went with 5.10 from
recursion to iteration keeping the intermediate matches on
the heap, which is ~10% slower but does not fall into any
stack-overflow limit. PCRE2 made a similar change at release
10.30, and also has many build-time and run-time
customizable limits.</p>
