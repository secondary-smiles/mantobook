<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IPC::Run::Win32Helper

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IPC::Run needs
to use sockets to redirect subprocess I/O so that the
<b>select()</b> loop will work on Win32. This seems to only
work on WinNT and Win2K at this time, not sure if it will
ever work on Win95 or Win98. If you have experience in this
area, please contact me at barries@slaysys.com, thanks!.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>optimize()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Most common incantations of
&quot;run()&quot; (<i>not</i> &quot;harness()&quot;,
&quot;start()&quot;, or &quot;finish()&quot;) now use
temporary files to redirect input and output instead of
pumper processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Temporary files
are used when sending to child processes if input is taken
from a scalar with no filter subroutines. This is the only
time we can assume that the parent is not interacting with
the child&rsquo;s redirected input as it runs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Temporary files
are used when receiving from children when output is to a
scalar or subroutine with or without filters, but only if
the child in question closes its inputs or takes input from
unfiltered SCALARs or named files. Normally, a child
inherits its <small>STDIN</small> from its parent; to close
it, use &quot;0&lt;&amp;&minus;&quot; or the &quot;noinherit
=&gt; 1&quot; option. If data is sent to the child from
<small>CODE</small> refs, filehandles or from scalars
through filters than the child&rsquo;s outputs will not be
optimized because &quot;optimize()&quot; assumes the parent
is interacting with the child. It is ok if the output is
filtered or handled by a subroutine, however.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This assumes
that all named files are real files (as opposed to named
pipes) and won&rsquo;t change; and that a process is not
communicating with the child indirectly (through means not
visible to IPC::Run). These can be an invalid assumptions,
but are the 99% case. Write me if you need an option to
enable or disable optimizations; I suspect it will work like
the &quot;binary()&quot; modifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To detect cases
that you might want to optimize by closing inputs, try
setting the &quot;IPCRUNDEBUG&quot; environment variable to
the special &quot;notopt&quot; value:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">C:&gt; set
IPCRUNDEBUG=notopt <br>
C:&gt; my_app_that_uses_IPC_Run.pl</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>optimizer()</b>
rationalizations</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only for that limited case can
we be sure that it&rsquo;s ok to batch all the input in to a
temporary file. If <small>STDIN</small> is from a
<small>SCALAR</small> or from a named file or filehandle
(again, only in &quot;run()&quot;), then outputs to
<small>CODE</small> refs are also assumed to be safe enough
to batch through a temp file, otherwise only outputs to
<small>SCALAR</small> refs are batched. This can cause a bit
of grief if the parent process benefits from or relies on a
bit of &quot;early returns&quot; coming in before the child
program exits. As long as the output is redirected to a
<small>SCALAR</small> ref, this will not be visible. When
output is redirected to a subroutine or (deprecated)
filters, the subroutine will not get any data until after
the child process exits, and it is likely to get bigger
chunks of data at once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
the optimization is that, without it, &quot;pumper&quot;
processes are used to overcome the inconsistencies of the
Win32 <small>API.</small> We need to use anonymous pipes to
connect to the child processes&rsquo; stdin, stdout, and
stderr, yet <b>select()</b> does not work on these.
<b>select()</b> only works on sockets on Win32. So for each
redirected child handle, there is normally a
&quot;pumper&quot; process that connects to the parent using
a socket--so the parent can <b>select()</b> on that fd--and
to the child on an anonymous pipe--so the child can
read/write a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using a socket
to connect directly to the child (as at least one
<small>MSDN</small> article suggests) seems to cause the
trailing output from most children to be lost. I think this
is because child processes rarely close their stdout and
stderr explicitly, and the winsock dll does not seem to
flush output when a process that uses it exits without
explicitly closing them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because of
these pumpers and the inherent slowness of Win32
<b>CreateProcess()</b>, child processes with redirects are
quite slow to launch; so this routine looks for the very
common case of reading/writing to/from scalar references in
a <b>run()</b> routine and converts such reads and writes in
to temporary file reads and writes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Such files are
marked as <small>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY</small> to
increase speed and as
<small>FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE</small> so it will be
cleaned up when the child process exits (for input files).
The user&rsquo;s default permissions are used for both the
temporary files and the directory that contains them, hope
your Win32 permissions are secure enough for you. Files are
created with the Win32API::File defaults of
FILE_SHARE_READ|FILE_SHARE_WRITE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Setting the
debug level to &quot;details&quot; or &quot;gory&quot; will
give detailed information about the optimization process;
setting it to &quot;basic&quot; or higher will tell whether
or not a given call is optimized. Setting it to
&quot;notopt&quot; will highlight those calls that
aren&rsquo;t optimized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">win32_parse_cmd_line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">@words = win32_parse_cmd_line(
q{foo bar 'baz baz' &quot;bat bat&quot;} );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">returns 4
words. This parses like the bourne shell (see the bit about
<b>shellwords()</b> in Text::ParseWords), assuming
we&rsquo;re trying to be a little cross-platform here. The
only difference is that &quot;\&quot; is *not* treated as an
escape except when it precedes punctuation, since it&rsquo;s
used all over the place in <small>DOS</small> path
specs.</p>

of Run.pm so all spawned processes get the benefit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">win32_spawn</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Spawns a child process,
possibly with <small>STDIN, STDOUT,</small> and
<small>STDERR</small> (file descriptors 0, 1, and 2,
respectively) redirected.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>LIMITATIONS</small></b>
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Cannot redirect
higher file descriptors due to lack of support for this in
the Win32 environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
worked around by marking a handle as inheritable in the
parent (or leaving it marked; this is the default in perl),
obtaining it&rsquo;s Win32 handle with
&quot;Win32API::GetOSFHandle(FH)&quot; or
&quot;Win32API::FdGetOsFHandle($fd)&quot; and passing it to
the child using the command line, the environment, or any
other <small>IPC</small> mechanism (it&rsquo;s a plain old
integer). The child can then use &quot;OsFHandleOpen()&quot;
or &quot;OsFHandleOpenFd()&quot; and possibly &quot;&lt;open
FOO &quot;&quot;&amp;BAR&quot;&gt;&gt; or &quot;&lt;open FOO
&quot;&quot;&amp;$fd&gt;&gt; as need be. Ach, the pain!</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Remember to
check the Win32 handle against
<small>INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE.</small></p>
