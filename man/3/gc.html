<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>GC_malloc</i>
and <i>GC_free</i> are plug-in replacements for standard
malloc and free. However, <i>GC_malloc</i> will attempt to
reclaim inaccessible space automatically by invoking a
conservative garbage collector at appropriate points. The
collector traverses all data structures accessible by
following pointers from the machines registers, stack(s),
data, and bss segments. Inaccessible structures will be
reclaimed. A machine word is considered to be a valid
pointer if it is an address inside an object allocated by
<i>GC_malloc</i> or friends.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In most cases
it is preferable to call the macros GC_MALLOC, GC_FREE, etc.
instead of calling GC_malloc and friends directly. This
allows debugging versions of the routines to be substituted
by defining GC_DEBUG before including gc.h.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
documentation in the include files gc_cpp.h and
gc_allocator.h, as well as the gcinterface.md file in the
distribution, for an alternate, C++ specific interface to
the garbage collector. Note that C++ programs generally need
to be careful to ensure that all allocated memory (whether
via new, malloc, or STL allocators) that may point to
garbage collected memory is either itself garbage collected,
or at least traced by the collector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike the
standard implementations of malloc, <i>GC_malloc</i> clears
the newly allocated storage. <i>GC_malloc_atomic</i> does
not. Furthermore, it informs the collector that the
resulting object will never contain any pointers, and should
therefore not be scanned by the collector.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>GC_free</i>
can be used to deallocate objects, but its use is optional,
and generally discouraged. <i>GC_realloc</i> has the
standard realloc semantics. It preserves pointer-free-ness.
<i>GC_register_finalizer</i> allows for registration of
functions that are invoked when an object becomes
inaccessible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The garbage
collector tries to avoid allocating memory at locations that
already appear to be referenced before allocation. (Such
apparent &lsquo;&lsquo;pointers&rsquo;&rsquo; are usually
large integers and the like that just happen to look like an
address.) This may make it hard to allocate very large
objects. An attempt to do so may generate a warning.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>GC_malloc_ignore_off_page</i>
and <i>GC_malloc_atomic_ignore_off_page</i> inform the
collector that the client code will always maintain a
pointer to near the beginning of the object (within the
first 512 bytes), and that pointers beyond that can be
ignored by the collector. This makes it much easier for the
collector to place large objects. These are recommended for
large object allocation. (Objects expected to be &gt; ~100
KB should be allocated this way.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to use the collector to find storage leaks in
programs destined to be run with standard malloc/free. The
collector can be compiled for thread-safe operation. Unlike
standard malloc, it is safe to call malloc after a previous
malloc call was interrupted by a signal, provided the
original malloc call is not resumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The collector
may, on rare occasion, produce warning messages. On UNIX
machines these appear on stderr. Warning messages can be
filtered, redirected, or ignored with
<i>GC_set_warn_proc</i> This is recommended for production
code. See gc.h for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fully portable
code should call <i>GC_INIT</i> from the primordial thread
of the main program before making any other GC calls. On
most platforms this does nothing and the collector is
initialized on first use. On a few platforms explicit
initialization is necessary. And it can never hurt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Debugging
versions of many of the above routines are provided as
macros. Their names are identical to the above, but consist
of all capital letters. If GC_DEBUG is defined before gc.h
is included, these routines do additional checking, and
allow the leak detecting version of the collector to produce
slightly more useful output. Without GC_DEBUG defined, they
behave exactly like the lower-case versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On some
machines, collection will be performed incrementally after a
call to <i>GC_enable_incremental.</i> This may temporarily
write protect pages in the heap. See the README file for
more information on how this interacts with system calls
that write to the heap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other
facilities not discussed here include limited facilities to
support incremental collection on machines without
appropriate VM support, provisions for providing more
explicit object layout information to the garbage collector,
more direct support for &lsquo;&lsquo;weak&rsquo;&rsquo;
pointers, support for &lsquo;&lsquo;abortable&rsquo;&rsquo;
garbage collections during idle time, etc.</p>
