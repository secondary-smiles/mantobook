<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Hash::Util::FieldHash&quot;
offers a number of functions in support of &quot;The
Inside-out Technique&quot; of class construction.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>id</p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="12%">


<p>id($obj)</p></td>
<td width="65%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
reference address of a reference $obj. If $obj is not a
reference, returns $obj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This function
is a stand-in replacement for Scalar::Util::refaddr, that
is, it returns the reference address of its argument as a
numeric value. The only difference is that
&quot;refaddr()&quot; returns &quot;undef&quot; when given a
non-reference while &quot;id()&quot; returns its argument
unchanged.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;id()&quot;
also uses a caching technique that makes it faster when the
id of an object is requested often, but slower if it is
needed only once or twice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">id_2obj</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">$obj = id_2obj($id)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If $id is the
id of a registered object (see &quot;register&quot;),
returns the object, otherwise an undefined value. For
registered objects this is the inverse function of
&quot;id()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">register</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">register($obj) <br>
register($obj, @hashrefs)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
form, registers an object to work with for the function
&quot;id_2obj()&quot;. In the second form, it additionally
marks the given hashrefs down for garbage collection. This
means that when the object goes out of scope, any entries in
the given hashes under the key of &quot;id($obj)&quot; will
be deleted from the hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is a fatal
error to register a non-reference $obj. Any non-hashrefs
among the following arguments are silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is
<i>not</i> an error to register the same object multiple
times with varying sets of hashrefs. Any hashrefs that are
not registered yet will be added, others ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Registry also
implies thread support. When a new thread is created, all
references are replaced with new ones, including all
objects. If a hash uses the reference address of an object
as a key, that connection would be broken. With a registered
object, its id will be updated in all hashes registered with
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">idhash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">idhash my %hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Makes an idhash
from the argument, which must be a hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">An
<i>idhash</i> works like a normal hash, except that it
stringifies a <i>reference used as a key</i> differently. A
reference is stringified as if the &quot;id()&quot; function
had been invoked on it, that is, its reference address in
decimal is used as the key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">idhashes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">idhashes \ my(%hash, %gnash,
%trash) <br>
idhashes \ @hashrefs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Creates many
idhashes from its hashref arguments. Returns those arguments
that could be converted or their number in scalar
context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fieldhash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">fieldhash %hash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Creates a
single fieldhash. The argument must be a hash. Returns a
reference to the given hash if successful, otherwise
nothing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
<i>fieldhash</i> is, in short, an idhash with auto-registry.
When an object (or, indeed, any reference) is used as a
fieldhash key, the fieldhash is automatically registered for
garbage collection with the object, as if &quot;register
$obj, \ %fieldhash&quot; had been called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fieldhashes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">fieldhashes @hashrefs;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Creates any
number of field hashes. Arguments must be hash references.
Returns the converted hashrefs in list context, their number
in scalar context.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A word on
terminology: I shall use the term <i>field</i> for a scalar
piece of data that a class associates with an object. Other
terms that have been used for this concept are &quot;object
variable&quot;, &quot;(object) property&quot;,
&quot;(object) attribute&quot; and more. Especially
&quot;attribute&quot; has some currency among Perl
programmer, but that clashes with the &quot;attributes&quot;
pragma. The term &quot;field&quot; also has some currency in
this sense and doesn&rsquo;t seem to conflict with other
Perl terminology.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl, an
object is a blessed reference. The standard way of
associating data with an object is to store the data inside
the object&rsquo;s body, that is, the piece of data pointed
to by the reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In consequence,
if two or more classes want to access an object they
<i>must</i> agree on the type of reference and also on the
organization of data within the object body. Failure to
agree on the type results in immediate death when the wrong
method tries to access an object. Failure to agree on data
organization may lead to one class trampling over the data
of another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This object
model leads to a tight coupling between subclasses. If one
class wants to inherit from another (and both classes access
object data), the classes must agree about implementation
details. Inheritance can only be used among classes that are
maintained together, in a single source or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In particular,
it is not possible to write general-purpose classes in this
technique, classes that can advertise themselves as
&quot;Put me on your @ISA list and use my methods&quot;. If
the other class has different ideas about how the object
body is used, there is trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For reference
&quot;Name_hash&quot; in &quot;Example 1&quot; shows the
standard implementation of a simple class &quot;Name&quot;
in the well-known hash based way. It also demonstrates the
predictable failure to construct a common subclass
&quot;NamedFile&quot; of &quot;Name&quot; and the class
&quot;IO::File&quot; (whose objects <i>must</i> be
globrefs).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus,
techniques are of interest that store object data <i>not</i>
in the object body but some other place.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
Inside-out Technique</b> <br>
With <i>inside-out</i> classes, each class declares a
(typically lexical) hash for each field it wants to use. The
reference address of an object is used as the hash key. By
definition, the reference address is unique to each object
so this guarantees a place for each field that is private to
the class and unique to each object. See &quot;Name_id&quot;
in &quot;Example 1&quot; for a simple example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In comparison
to the standard implementation where the object is a hash
and the fields correspond to hash keys, here the fields
correspond to hashes, and the object determines the hash
key. Thus the hashes appear to be turned <i>inside
out</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The body of an
object is never examined by an inside-out class, only its
reference address is used. This allows for the body of an
actual object to be <i>anything at all</i> while the object
methods of the class still work as designed. This is a key
feature of inside-out classes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Problems of
Inside-out</b> <br>
Inside-out classes give us freedom of inheritance, but as
usual there is a price.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most obviously,
there is the necessity of retrieving the reference address
of an object for each data access. It&rsquo;s a minor
inconvenience, but it does clutter the code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More important
(and less obvious) is the necessity of garbage collection.
When a normal object dies, anything stored in the object
body is garbage-collected by perl. With inside-out objects,
Perl knows nothing about the data stored in field hashes by
a class, but these must be deleted when the object goes out
of scope. Thus the class must provide a &quot;DESTROY&quot;
method to take care of that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the presence
of multiple classes it can be non-trivial to make sure that
every relevant destructor is called for every object. Perl
calls the first one it finds on the inheritance tree (if
any) and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A related issue
is thread-safety. When a new thread is created, the Perl
interpreter is cloned, which implies that all reference
addresses in use will be replaced with new ones. Thus, if a
class tries to access a field of a cloned object its
(cloned) data will still be stored under the now invalid
reference address of the original in the parent thread. A
general &quot;CLONE&quot; method must be provided to
re-establish the association.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Solutions</b>
<br>
&quot;Hash::Util::FieldHash&quot; addresses these issues on
several levels.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;id()&quot; function is provided in addition to the
existing &quot;Scalar::Util::refaddr()&quot;. Besides its
short name it can be a little faster under some
circumstances (and a bit slower under others). Benchmark if
it matters. The working of &quot;id()&quot; also allows the
use of the class name as a <i>generic object</i> as
described further down.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;id()&quot; function is incorporated in <i>id
hashes</i> in the sense that it is called automatically on
every key that is used with the hash. No explicit call is
necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The problems of
garbage collection and thread safety are both addressed by
the function &quot;register()&quot;. It registers an object
together with any number of hashes. Registry means that when
the object dies, an entry in any of the hashes under the
reference address of this object will be deleted. This
guarantees garbage collection in these hashes. It also means
that on thread cloning the object&rsquo;s entries in
registered hashes will be replaced with updated entries
whose key is the cloned object&rsquo;s reference address.
Thus the object-data association becomes thread-safe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Object registry
is best done when the object is initialized for use with a
class. That way, garbage collection and thread safety are
established for every object and every field that is
initialized.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally,
<i>field hashes</i> incorporate all these functions in one
package. Besides automatically calling the &quot;id()&quot;
function on every object used as a key, the object is
registered with the field hash on first use. Classes based
on field hashes are fully garbage-collected and thread safe
without further measures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>More
Problems</b> <br>
Another problem that occurs with inside-out classes is
serialization. Since the object data is not in its usual
place, standard routines like
&quot;Storable::freeze()&quot;, &quot;Storable::thaw()&quot;
and &quot;Data::Dumper::Dumper()&quot; can&rsquo;t deal with
it on their own. Both &quot;Data::Dumper&quot; and
&quot;Storable&quot; provide the necessary hooks to make
things work, but the functions or methods used by the hooks
must be provided by each inside-out class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A general
solution to the serialization problem would require another
level of registry, one that associates <i>classes</i> and
fields. So far, the functions of
&quot;Hash::Util::FieldHash&quot; are unaware of any
classes, which I consider a feature. Therefore
&quot;Hash::Util::FieldHash&quot; doesn&rsquo;t address the
serialization problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The Generic
Object</b> <br>
Classes based on the &quot;id()&quot; function (and hence
classes based on &quot;idhash()&quot; and
&quot;fieldhash()&quot;) show a peculiar behavior in that
the class name can be used like an object. Specifically,
methods that set or read data associated with an object
continue to work as class methods, just as if the class name
were an object, distinct from all other objects, with its
own data. This object may be called the <i>generic
object</i> of the class.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This works
because field hashes respond to keys that are not references
like a normal hash would and use the string offered as the
hash key. Thus, if a method is called as a class method, the
field hash is presented with the class name instead of an
object and blithely uses it as a key. Since the keys of real
objects are decimal numbers, there is no conflict and the
slot in the field hash can be used like any other. The
&quot;id()&quot; function behaves correspondingly with
respect to non-reference arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two possible
uses (besides ignoring the property) come to mind. A
singleton class could be implemented this using the generic
object. If necessary, an &quot;init()&quot; method could die
or ignore calls with actual objects (references), so only
the generic object will ever exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another use of
the generic object would be as a template. It is a
convenient place to store class-specific defaults for
various fields to be used in actual object
initialization.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Usually, the
feature can be entirely ignored. Calling <i>object
methods</i> as <i>class methods</i> normally leads to an
error and isn&rsquo;t used routinely anywhere. It may be a
problem that this error isn&rsquo;t indicated by a class
with a generic object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How to use
Field Hashes</b> <br>
Traditionally, the definition of an inside-out class
contains a bare block inside which a number of lexical
hashes are declared and the basic accessor methods defined,
usually through &quot;Scalar::Util::refaddr&quot;. Further
methods may be defined outside this block. There has to be a
<small>DESTROY</small> method and, for thread support, a
<small>CLONE</small> method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When field
hashes are used, the basic structure remains the same. Each
lexical hash will be made a field hash. The call to
&quot;refaddr&quot; can be omitted from the accessor
methods. <small>DESTROY</small> and <small>CLONE</small>
methods are not necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have an
existing inside-out class, simply making all hashes field
hashes with no other change should make no difference.
Through the calls to &quot;refaddr&quot; or equivalent, the
field hashes never get to see a reference and work like
normal hashes. Your <small>DESTROY</small> (and
<small>CLONE</small> ) methods are still needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make the
field hashes kick in, it is easiest to redefine
&quot;refaddr&quot; as</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub refaddr {
shift }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">instead of
importing it from &quot;Scalar::Util&quot;. It should now be
possible to disable <small>DESTROY</small> and
<small>CLONE.</small> Note that while it isn&rsquo;t
disabled, <small>DESTROY</small> will be called before the
garbage collection of field hashes, so it will be invoked
with a functional object and will continue to function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
desirable to import the functions &quot;fieldhash&quot;
and/or &quot;fieldhashes&quot; into every class that is
going to use them. They are only used once to set up the
class. When the class is up and running, these functions
serve no more purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there are
only a few field hashes to declare, it is simplest to</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
Hash::Util::FieldHash;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">early and call
the functions qualified:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hash::Util::FieldHash::fieldhash
my %foo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise,
import the functions into a convenient package like
&quot;HUF&quot; or, more general, &quot;Aux&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
package Aux; <br>
use Hash::Util::FieldHash ':all'; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and call</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Aux::fieldhash
my %foo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">as needed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Garbage-Collected
Hashes</b> <br>
Garbage collection in a field hash means that entries will
&quot;spontaneously&quot; disappear when the object that
created them disappears. That must be borne in mind,
especially when looping over a field hash. If anything you
do inside the loop could cause an object to go out of scope,
a random key may be deleted from the hash you are looping
over. That can throw the loop iterator, so it&rsquo;s best
to cache a consistent snapshot of the keys and/or values and
loop over that. You will still have to check that a cached
entry still exists when you get to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Garbage
collection can be confusing when keys are created in a field
hash from normal scalars as well as references. Once a
reference is <i>used</i> with a field hash, the entry will
be collected, even if it was later overwritten with a plain
scalar key (every positive integer is a candidate). This is
true even if the original entry was deleted in the meantime.
In fact, deletion from a field hash, and also a test for
existence constitute <i>use</i> in this sense and create a
liability to delete the entry when the reference goes out of
scope. If you happen to create an entry with an identical
key from a string or integer, that will be collected
instead. Thus, mixed use of references and plain scalars as
field hash keys is not entirely supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the second
step, the free inheritability of the implementation (or lack
thereof) is demonstrated. For this purpose it constructs a
class called &quot;NamedFile&quot; which is a common
subclass of &quot;Name&quot; and the standard class
&quot;IO::File&quot;. This puts inheritability to the test
because objects of &quot;IO::File&quot; <i>must</i> be
globrefs. Objects of &quot;NamedFile&quot; should behave
like a file opened for reading and also support the
&quot;name()&quot; method. This class juncture works with
exception of the &quot;Name_hash&quot; implementation, where
object initialization fails because of the incompatibility
of object bodies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make
&quot;Hash::Util::FieldHash&quot; work, there were two
changes to <i>perl</i> itself. &quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot;
was made available for hashes, and weak references now call
uvar &quot;get&quot; magic after a weakref has been cleared.
The first feature is used to make field hashes intercept
their keys upon access. The second one triggers garbage
collection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
&quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot; interface for hashes</b> <br>
&quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot; <i>get</i> magic is called from
&quot;hv_fetch_common&quot; and &quot;hv_delete_common&quot;
through the function &quot;hv_magic_uvar_xkey&quot;, which
defines the interface. The call happens for hashes with
&quot;uvar&quot; magic if the &quot;ufuncs&quot; structure
has equal values in the &quot;uf_val&quot; and
&quot;uf_set&quot; fields. Hashes are unaffected if (and as
long as) these fields hold different values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon the call,
the &quot;mg_obj&quot; field will hold the hash key to be
accessed. Upon return, the &quot;SV*&quot; value in
&quot;mg_obj&quot; will be used in place of the original key
in the hash access. The integer index value in the first
parameter will be the &quot;action&quot; value from
&quot;hv_fetch_common&quot;, or &minus;1 if the call is from
&quot;hv_delete_common&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
template for a function suitable for the &quot;uf_val&quot;
field in a &quot;ufuncs&quot; structure for this call. The
&quot;uf_set&quot; and &quot;uf_index&quot; fields are
irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">IV
watch_key(pTHX_ IV action, SV* field) { <br>
MAGIC* mg = mg_find(field, PERL_MAGIC_uvar); <br>
SV* keysv = mg&minus;&gt;mg_obj; <br>
/* Do whatever you need to. If you decide to <br>
supply a different key newkey, return it like this <br>
*/ <br>
sv_2mortal(newkey); <br>
mg&minus;&gt;mg_obj = newkey; <br>
return 0; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Weakrefs
call uvar magic</b> <br>
When a weak reference is stored in an &quot;SV&quot; that
has &quot;uvar&quot; magic, &quot;set&quot; magic is called
after the reference has gone stale. This hook can be used to
trigger further garbage-collection activities associated
with the referenced object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How field
hashes work</b> <br>
The three features of key hashes, <i>key replacement</i>,
<i>thread support</i>, and <i>garbage collection</i> are
supported by a data structure called the <i>object
registry</i>. This is a private hash where every object is
stored. An &quot;object&quot; in this sense is any reference
(blessed or unblessed) that has been used as a field hash
key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The object
registry keeps track of references that have been used as
field hash keys. The keys are generated from the reference
address like in a field hash (though the registry
isn&rsquo;t a field hash). Each value is a weak copy of the
original reference, stored in an &quot;SV&quot; that is
itself magical (&quot;PERL_MAGIC_uvar&quot; again). The
magical structure holds a list (another hash, really) of
field hashes that the reference has been used with. When the
weakref becomes stale, the magic is activated and uses the
list to delete the reference from all field hashes it has
been used with. After that, the entry is removed from the
object registry itself. Implicitly, that frees the magic
structure and the storage it has been using.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whenever a
reference is used as a field hash key, the object registry
is checked and a new entry is made if necessary. The field
hash is then added to the list of fields this reference has
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The object
registry is also used to repair a field hash after thread
cloning. Here, the entire object registry is processed. For
every reference found there, the field hashes it has used
are visited and the entry is updated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Internal
function Hash::Util::FieldHash::_fieldhash</b> <br>
# test if %hash is a field hash <br>
my $result = _fieldhash \ %hash, 0; <br>
# make %hash a field hash <br>
my $result = _fieldhash \ %hash, 1;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;_fieldhash&quot;
is the internal function used to create field hashes. It
takes two arguments, a hashref and a mode. If the mode is
boolean false, the hash is not changed but tested if it is a
field hash. If the hash isn&rsquo;t a field hash the return
value is boolean false. If it is, the return value indicates
the mode of field hash. When called with a boolean true
mode, it turns the given hash into a field hash of this
mode, returning the mode of the created field hash.
&quot;_fieldhash&quot; does not erase the given hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently there
is only one type of field hash, and only the boolean value
of the mode makes a difference, but that may change.</p>
