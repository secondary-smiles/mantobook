<h2>LOCAL UNWINDING
<a name="LOCAL UNWINDING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Libunwind is
very easy to use when unwinding a stack from within a
running program. This is called <i>local</i> unwinding. Say
you want to unwind the stack while executing in some
function F(). In this function, you would call
unw_getcontext() to get a snapshot of the CPU registers
(machine&minus;state). Then you initialize an <i>unwind
cursor</i> based on this snapshot. This is done with a call
to unw_init_local(). The cursor now points to the current
frame, that is, the stack frame that corresponds to the
current activation of function F(). The unwind cursor can
then be moved &lsquo;&lsquo;up&rsquo;&rsquo; (towards
earlier stack frames) by calling unw_step(). By repeatedly
calling this routine, you can uncover the entire
call&minus;chain that led to the activation of function F().
A positive return value from unw_step() indicates that there
are more frames in the chain, zero indicates that the end of
the chain has been reached, and any negative value indicates
that some sort of error has occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While it is not
possible to directly move the unwind cursor in the
&lsquo;&lsquo;down&rsquo;&rsquo; direction (towards newer
stack frames), this effect can be achieved by making copies
of an unwind cursor. For example, a program that sometimes
has to move &lsquo;&lsquo;down&rsquo;&rsquo; by one stack
frame could maintain two cursor variables:
&lsquo;&lsquo;curr&rsquo;&rsquo; and
&lsquo;&lsquo;prev&rsquo;&rsquo;. The former would be used
as the current cursor and prev would be maintained as the
&lsquo;&lsquo;previous frame&rsquo;&rsquo; cursor by copying
the contents of curr to prev right before calling
unw_step(). With this approach, the program could move one
step &lsquo;&lsquo;down&rsquo;&rsquo; simply by copying back
prev to curr whenever that is necessary. In the most extreme
case, a program could maintain a separate cursor for each
call frame and that way it could move up and down the
callframe&minus;chain at will.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given an unwind
cursor, it is possible to read and write the CPU registers
that were preserved for the current stack frame (as
identified by the cursor). Libunwind provides several
routines for this purpose: unw_get_reg() reads an integer
(general) register, unw_get_fpreg() reads a
floating&minus;point register, unw_set_reg() writes an
integer register, and unw_set_fpreg() writes a
floating&minus;point register. Note that, by definition,
only the <i>preserved</i> machine state can be accessed
during an unwind operation. Normally, this state consists of
the <i>callee&minus;saved</i>
(&lsquo;&lsquo;preserved&rsquo;&rsquo;) registers. However,
in some special circumstances (e.g., in a signal handler
trampoline), even the <i>caller&minus;saved</i>
(&lsquo;&lsquo;scratch&rsquo;&rsquo;) registers are
preserved in the stack frame and, in those cases, libunwind
will grant access to them as well. The exact set of
registers that can be accessed via the cursor depends, of
course, on the platform. However, there are two registers
that can be read on all platforms: the instruction pointer
(IP), sometimes also known as the &lsquo;&lsquo;program
counter&rsquo;&rsquo;, and the stack pointer (SP). In
libunwind, these registers are identified by the macros
UNW_REG_IP and UNW_REG_SP, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Besides just
moving the unwind cursor and reading/writing saved
registers, libunwind also provides the ability to resume
execution at an arbitrary stack frame. As you might guess,
this is useful for implementing non&minus;local gotos and
the exception handling needed by some high&minus;level
languages such as Java. Resuming execution with a particular
stack frame simply requires calling unw_resume() and passing
the cursor identifying the target frame as the only
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally,
libunwind supports both local and remote unwinding (the
latter will be explained in the next section). However, if
you tell libunwind that your program only needs local
unwinding, then a special implementation can be selected
which may run much faster than the generic implementation
which supports both kinds of unwinding. To select this
optimized version, simply define the macro UNW_LOCAL_ONLY
before including the headerfile &lt;libunwind.h&gt;. It is
perfectly OK for a single program to employ both
local&minus;only and generic unwinding. That is, whether or
not UNW_LOCAL_ONLY is defined is a choice that each
source&minus;file (compilation&minus;unit) can make on its
own. Independent of the setting(s) of UNW_LOCAL_ONLY,
you&rsquo;ll always link the same library into the program
(normally <b>&minus;l</b>unwind). Furthermore, the portion
of libunwind that manages unwind&minus;info for dynamically
generated code is not affected by the setting of
UNW_LOCAL_ONLY.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If we put all
of the above together, here is how we could use libunwind to
write a function
&lsquo;&lsquo;show_backtrace()&rsquo;&rsquo; which prints a
classic stack trace:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#define
UNW_LOCAL_ONLY <br>
#include &lt;libunwind.h&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">void
show_backtrace (void) { <br>
unw_cursor_t cursor; unw_context_t uc; <br>
unw_word_t ip, sp;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">unw_getcontext(&amp;uc);
<br>
unw_init_local(&amp;cursor, &amp;uc); <br>
while (unw_step(&amp;cursor) &gt; 0) { <br>
unw_get_reg(&amp;cursor, UNW_REG_IP, &amp;ip); <br>
unw_get_reg(&amp;cursor, UNW_REG_SP, &amp;sp); <br>
printf (&quot;ip = %lx, sp = %lx\n&quot;, (long) ip, (long)
sp); <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<h2>REMOTE UNWINDING
<a name="REMOTE UNWINDING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Libunwind can
also be used to unwind a stack in a
&lsquo;&lsquo;remote&rsquo;&rsquo; process. Here,
&lsquo;&lsquo;remote&rsquo;&rsquo; may mean another process
on the same machine or even a process on a completely
different machine from the one that is running libunwind.
Remote unwinding is typically used by debuggers and
instruction&minus;set simulators, for example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before you can
unwind a remote process, you need to create a new
address&minus;space object for that process. This is
achieved with the unw_create_addr_space() routine. The
routine takes two arguments: a pointer to a set of
<i>accessor</i> routines and an integer that specifies the
byte&minus;order of the target process. The accessor
routines provide libunwind with the means to communicate
with the remote process. In particular, there are callbacks
to read and write the process&rsquo;s memory, its registers,
and to access unwind information which may be needed by
libunwind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the
address space created, unwinding can be initiated by a call
to unw_init_remote(). This routine is very similar to
unw_init_local(), except that it takes an
address&minus;space object and an opaque pointer as
arguments. The routine uses these arguments to fetch the
initial machine state. Libunwind never uses the opaque
pointer on its own, but instead just passes it on to the
accessor (callback) routines. Typically, this pointer is
used to select, e.g., the thread within a process that is to
be unwound.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once a cursor
has been initialized with unw_init_remote(), unwinding works
exactly like in the local case. That is, you can use
unw_step() to move &lsquo;&lsquo;up&rsquo;&rsquo; in the
call&minus;chain, read and write registers, or resume
execution at a particular stack frame by calling
unw_resume.</p>

<h2>CROSS&minus;PLATFORM AND MULTI&minus;PLATFORM UNWINDING
<a name="CROSS&minus;PLATFORM AND MULTI&minus;PLATFORM UNWINDING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Libunwind has
been designed to enable unwinding across platforms
(architectures). Indeed, a single program can use libunwind
to unwind an arbitrary number of target platforms, all at
the same time!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We call the
machine that is running libunwind the <i>host</i> and the
machine that is running the process being unwound the
<i>target</i>. If the host and the target platform are the
same, we call it <i>native</i> unwinding. If they differ, we
call it <i>cross&minus;platform</i> unwinding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The principle
behind supporting native, cross&minus;platform, and
multi&minus;platform unwinding is very simple: for native
unwinding, a program includes &lt;libunwind.h&gt; and uses
the linker switch <b>&minus;l</b>unwind. For
cross&minus;platform unwinding, a program includes
&lt;libunwind&minus;PLAT.h&gt; and uses the linker switch
<b>&minus;l</b>unwind&minus;PLAT, where PLAT is the name of
the target platform (e.g., ia64 for IA&minus;64,
hppa&minus;elf for ELF&minus;based HP PA&minus;RISC, or x86
for 80386). Multi&minus;platform unwinding works exactly
like cross&minus;platform unwinding, the only limitation is
that a single source file (compilation unit) can include at
most one libunwind header file. In other words, the
platform&minus;specific support for each supported target
needs to be isolated in separate source
files&minus;&minus;&minus;a limitation that shouldn&rsquo;t
be an issue in practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that, by
definition, local unwinding is possible only for the native
case. Attempting to call, e.g., unw_local_init() when
targeting a cross&minus;platform will result in a
link&minus;time error (unresolved references).</p>

<h2>THREAD&minus; AND SIGNAL&minus;SAFETY
<a name="THREAD&minus; AND SIGNAL&minus;SAFETY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All libunwind
routines are thread&minus;safe. What this means is that
multiple threads may use libunwind simulatenously. However,
any given cursor may be accessed by only one thread at any
given time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To ensure
thread&minus;safety, some libunwind routines may have to use
locking. Such routines <i>must not</i> be called from signal
handlers (directly or indirectly) and are therefore
<i>not</i> signal&minus;safe. The manual page for each
libunwind routine identifies whether or not it is
signal&minus;safe, but as a general rule, any routine that
may be needed for <i>local</i> unwinding is
signal&minus;safe (e.g., unw_step() for local unwinding is
signal&minus;safe). For remote&minus;unwinding, <i>none</i>
of the libunwind routines are guaranteed to be
signal&minus;safe.</p>

<h2>UNWINDING THROUGH DYNAMICALLY GENERATED CODE
<a name="UNWINDING THROUGH DYNAMICALLY GENERATED CODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Libunwind
provides the routines _U_dyn_register() and _U_dyn_cancel()
to register/cancel the information required to unwind
through code that has been generated at runtime (e.g., by a
just&minus;in&minus;time (JIT) compiler). It is important to
register the information for <i>all</i> dynamically
generated code because otherwise, a debugger may not be able
to function properly or high&minus;level language exception
handling may not work as expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The interface
for registering and canceling dynamic unwind info has been
designed for maximum efficiency, so as to minimize the
performance impact on JIT&minus;compilers. In particular,
both routines are guaranteed to execute in
&lsquo;&lsquo;constant time&rsquo;&rsquo; (O(1)) and the
data&minus;structure encapsulating the dynamic unwind info
has been designed to facilitate sharing, such that similar
procedures can share much of the underlying information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more
information on the libunwind support for dynamically
generated code, see libunwind&minus;dynamic(3).</p>

<h2>CACHING OF UNWIND INFO
<a name="CACHING OF UNWIND INFO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To speed up
execution, libunwind may aggressively cache the information
it needs to perform unwinding. If a process changes during
its lifetime, this creates a risk of libunwind using stale
data. For example, this would happen if libunwind were to
cache information about a shared library which later on gets
unloaded (e.g., via <i>dlclose</i>(3)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To prevent the
risk of using stale data, libunwind provides two facilities:
first, it is possible to flush the cached information
associated with a specific address range in the target
process (or the entire address space, if desired). This
functionality is provided by unw_flush_cache(). The second
facility is provided by unw_set_caching_policy(), which lets
a program select the exact caching policy in use for a given
address&minus;space object. In particular, by selecting the
policy UNW_CACHE_NONE, it is possible to turn off caching
completely, therefore eliminating the risk of stale data
alltogether (at the cost of slower execution). By default,
caching is enabled for local unwinding only. The cache size
can be dynamically changed with unw_set_cache_size(), which
also fluches the current cache.</p>
