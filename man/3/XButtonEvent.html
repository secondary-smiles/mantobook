<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive these events, their structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> event to a client application, it
sends an <b>XGraphicsExposeEvent</b> structure with the type
member set to <b>GraphicsExpose</b>. The display member is
set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The
send_event member is set to <b>True</b> if the event came
from a <b>SendEvent</b> protocol request. The serial member
is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
structures have the following common members: window, root,
subwindow, time, x, y, x_root, y_root, state, and
same_screen. The window member is set to the window on which
the event was generated and is referred to as the event
window. As long as the conditions previously discussed are
met, this is the window used by the X server to report the
event. The root member is set to the source window&rsquo;s
root window. The x_root and y_root members are set to the
pointer&rsquo;s coordinates relative to the root
window&rsquo;s origin at the time of the event.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The same_screen
member is set to indicate whether the event window is on the
same screen as the root window and can be either <b>True</b>
or <b>False</b>. If <b>True</b>, the event and root windows
are on the same screen. If <b>False</b>, the event and root
windows are not on the same screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the source
window is an inferior of the event window, the subwindow
member of the structure is set to the child of the event
window that is the source window or the child of the event
window that is an ancestor of the source window. Otherwise,
the X server sets the subwindow member to <b>None</b>. The
time member is set to the time when the event was generated
and is expressed in milliseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the event
window is on the same screen as the root window, the x and y
members are set to the coordinates relative to the event
window&rsquo;s origin. Otherwise, these members are set to
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The state
member is set to indicate the logical state of the pointer
buttons and modifier keys just prior to the event, which is
the bitwise inclusive OR of one or more of the button or
modifier key masks: <b>Button1Mask</b>, <b>Button2Mask</b>,
<b>Button3Mask</b>, <b>Button4Mask</b>, <b>Button5Mask</b>,
<b>ShiftMask</b>, <b>LockMask</b>, <b>ControlMask</b>,
<b>Mod1Mask</b>, <b>Mod2Mask</b>, <b>Mod3Mask</b>,
<b>Mod4Mask</b>, and <b>Mod5Mask</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each of these
structures also has a member that indicates the detail. For
the <b>XKeyPressedEvent</b> and <b>XKeyReleasedEvent</b>
structures, this member is called a keycode. It is set to a
number that represents a physical key on the keyboard. The
keycode is an arbitrary representation for any key on the
keyboard (see sections 12.7 and 16.1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
<b>XButtonPressedEvent</b> and <b>XButtonReleasedEvent</b>
structures, this member is called button. It represents the
pointer button that changed state and can be the
<b>Button1</b>, <b>Button2</b>, <b>Button3</b>,
<b>Button4</b>, or <b>Button5</b> value. For the
<b>XPointerMovedEvent</b> structure, this member is called
is_hint. It can be set to <b>NotifyNormal</b> or
<b>NotifyHint</b>.</p>
