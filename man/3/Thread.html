<h2>NAME

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thread &minus;
Manipulate threads in Perl (for old code only)</p>

<h2>DEPRECATED
<a name="DEPRECATED"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Thread&quot; module served as the frontend to the
old-style thread model, called <i>5005threads</i>, that was
introduced in release 5.005. That model was deprecated, and
has been removed in version 5.10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For old code
and interim backwards compatibility, the &quot;Thread&quot;
module has been reworked to function as a frontend for the
new interpreter threads (<i>ithreads</i>) model. However,
some previous functionality is not available. Further, the
data sharing models between the two thread models are
completely different, and anything to do with data sharing
has to be thought differently. With <i>ithreads</i>, you
must explicitly &quot;share()&quot; variables between the
threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are
strongly encouraged to migrate any existing threaded code to
the new model (i.e., use the &quot;threads&quot; and
&quot;threads::shared&quot; modules) as soon as
possible.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.005,
the thread model was that all data is implicitly shared, and
shared access to data has to be explicitly synchronized.
This model is called <i>5005threads</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.6, a
new model was introduced in which all is was thread local
and shared access to data has to be explicitly declared.
This model is called <i>ithreads</i>, for &quot;interpreter
threads&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.6,
the <i>ithreads</i> model was not available as a public
<small>API</small> ; only as an internal <small>API</small>
that was available for extension writers, and to implement
<b>fork()</b> emulation on Win32 platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.8,
the <i>ithreads</i> model became available through the
&quot;threads&quot; module, and the <i>5005threads</i> model
was deprecated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.10,
the <i>5005threads</i> model was removed from the Perl
interpreter.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Thread&quot; module provides multithreading support
for Perl.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$thread =
Thread&minus;&gt;new(\&amp;start_sub) <br>
$thread = Thread&minus;&gt;new(\&amp;start_sub,
<small>LIST</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">&quot;new&quot; starts a new
thread of execution in the referenced subroutine. The
optional list is passed as parameters to the subroutine.
Execution continues in both the subroutine and the code
after the &quot;new&quot; call.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Thread&minus;&gt;new&quot;
returns a thread object representing the newly created
thread.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lock
<small>VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">&quot;lock&quot; places a lock
on a variable until the lock goes out of scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If the variable
is locked by another thread, the &quot;lock&quot; call will
block until it&rsquo;s available. &quot;lock&quot; is
recursive, so multiple calls to &quot;lock&quot; are
safe--the variable will remain locked until the outermost
lock on the variable goes out of scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Locks on
variables only affect &quot;lock&quot; calls--they do
<i>not</i> affect normal access to a variable. (Locks on
subs are different, and covered in a bit.) If you really,
<i>really</i> want locks to block access, then go ahead and
tie them to something and manage this yourself. This is done
on purpose. While managing access to variables is a good
thing, Perl doesn&rsquo;t force you out of its living
room...</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If a container
object, such as a hash or array, is locked, all the elements
of that container are not locked. For example, if a thread
does a &quot;lock @a&quot;, any other thread doing a
&quot;lock($a[12])&quot; won&rsquo;t block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Finally,
&quot;lock&quot; will traverse up references exactly
<i>one</i> level. &quot;lock(\$a)&quot; is equivalent to
&quot;lock($a)&quot;, while &quot;lock(\\$a)&quot; is
not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">async <small>BLOCK</small>
;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">&quot;async&quot; creates a
thread to execute the block immediately following it. This
block is treated as an anonymous sub, and so must have a
semi-colon after the closing brace. Like
&quot;Thread&minus;&gt;new&quot;, &quot;async&quot; returns
a thread object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Thread&minus;&gt;self</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The
&quot;Thread&minus;&gt;self&quot; function returns a thread
object that represents the thread making the
&quot;Thread&minus;&gt;self&quot; call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Thread&minus;&gt;list</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Returns a list of all
non-joined, non-detached Thread objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cond_wait
<small>VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The &quot;cond_wait&quot;
function takes a <b>locked</b> variable as a parameter,
unlocks the variable, and blocks until another thread does a
&quot;cond_signal&quot; or &quot;cond_broadcast&quot; for
that same locked variable. The variable that
&quot;cond_wait&quot; blocked on is relocked after the
&quot;cond_wait&quot; is satisfied. If there are multiple
threads &quot;cond_wait&quot;ing on the same variable, all
but one will reblock waiting to re-acquire the lock on the
variable. (So if you&rsquo;re only using
&quot;cond_wait&quot; for synchronization, give up the lock
as soon as possible.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cond_signal
<small>VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The &quot;cond_signal&quot;
function takes a locked variable as a parameter and unblocks
one thread that&rsquo;s &quot;cond_wait&quot;ing on that
variable. If more than one thread is blocked in a
&quot;cond_wait&quot; on that variable, only one (and which
one is indeterminate) will be unblocked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If there are no
threads blocked in a &quot;cond_wait&quot; on the variable,
the signal is discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cond_broadcast
<small>VARIABLE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The &quot;cond_broadcast&quot;
function works similarly to &quot;cond_signal&quot;.
&quot;cond_broadcast&quot;, though, will unblock <b>all</b>
the threads that are blocked in a &quot;cond_wait&quot; on
the locked variable, rather than only one.</p>

you should either wrap the &quot;join&quot; in an

also &quot;lock&quot; a sub such that any calls to that sub
from another thread would block until the lock was
released.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Also,
subroutines could be declared with the &quot;:locked&quot;
attribute which would serialize access to the subroutine,
but allowed different threads non-simultaneous access.</p>
