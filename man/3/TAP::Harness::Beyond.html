<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Test::Harness
is responsible for running test scripts, analysing their
output and reporting success or failure. When I type <i>make
test</i> (or <i>./Build test</i>) for a module,
Test::Harness is usually used to run the tests (not all
modules use Test::Harness but the majority do).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To start
exploring some of the features of Test::Harness I need to
switch from <i>make test</i> to the <i>prove</i> command
(which ships with Test::Harness). For the following examples
I&rsquo;ll also need a recent version of Test::Harness
installed; 3.14 is current as I write.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
examples I&rsquo;m going to assume that we&rsquo;re working
with a &rsquo;normal&rsquo; Perl module distribution.
Specifically I&rsquo;ll assume that typing <i>make</i> or
<i>./Build</i> causes the built, ready-to-install module
code to be available below ./blib/lib and ./blib/arch and
that there&rsquo;s a directory called &rsquo;t&rsquo; that
contains our tests. Test::Harness isn&rsquo;t hardwired to
that configuration but it saves me from explaining which
files live where for each example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Back to
<i>prove</i>; like <i>make test</i> it runs a test suite
&minus; but it provides far more control over which tests
are executed, in what order and how their results are
reported. Typically <i>make test</i> runs all the test
scripts below the &rsquo;t&rsquo; directory. To do the same
thing with prove I type:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;rb
t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The switches
here are &minus;r to recurse into any directories below
&rsquo;t&rsquo; and &minus;b which adds ./blib/lib and
./blib/arch to Perl&rsquo;s include path so that the tests
can find the code they will be testing. If I&rsquo;m testing
a module of which an earlier version is already installed I
need to be careful about the include path to make sure
I&rsquo;m not running my tests against the installed version
rather than the new one that I&rsquo;m working on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike <i>make
test</i>, typing <i>prove</i> doesn&rsquo;t automatically
rebuild my module. If I forget to make before prove I will
be testing against older versions of those files &minus;
which inevitably leads to confusion. I either get into the
habit of typing</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">make &amp;&amp;
prove &minus;rb t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or &minus; if I
have no <small>XS</small> code that needs to be built I use
the modules below <i>lib</i> instead</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove
&minus;Ilib &minus;r t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So far
I&rsquo;ve shown you nothing that <i>make test</i>
doesn&rsquo;t do. Let&rsquo;s fix that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Saved
State</b> <br>
If I have failing tests in a test suite that consists of
more than a handful of scripts and takes more than a few
seconds to run it rapidly becomes tedious to run the whole
test suite repeatedly as I track down the problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I can tell
prove just to run the tests that are failing like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;b
t/this_fails.t t/so_does_this.t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That speeds
things up but I have to make a note of which tests are
failing and make sure that I run those tests. Instead I can
use prove&rsquo;s &minus;&minus;state switch and have it
keep track of failing tests for me. First I do a complete
run of the test suite and tell prove to save the
results:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;rb
&minus;&minus;state=save t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That stores a
machine readable summary of the test run in a file called
&rsquo;.prove&rsquo; in the current directory. If I have
failures I can then run just the failing scripts like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;b
&minus;&minus;state=failed</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I can also tell
prove to save the results again so that it updates its idea
of which tests failed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;b
&minus;&minus;state=failed,save</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As soon as one
of my failing tests passes it will be removed from the list
of failed tests. Eventually I fix them all and prove can
find no failing tests to run:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files=0,
Tests=0, 0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr + 0.00 sys = 0.00 CPU)
<br>
Result: NOTESTS</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As I work on a
particular part of my module it&rsquo;s most likely that the
tests that cover that code will fail. I&rsquo;d like to run
the whole test suite but have it prioritize these
&rsquo;hot&rsquo; tests. I can tell prove to do this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;rb
&minus;&minus;state=hot,save t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All the tests
will run but those that failed most recently will be run
first. If no tests have failed since I started saving state
all tests will run in their normal order. This combines full
test coverage with early notification of failures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&minus;&minus;state switch supports a number of options; for
example to run failed tests first followed by all remaining
tests ordered by the timestamps of the test scripts &minus;
and save the results &minus; I can use</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;rb
&minus;&minus;state=failed,new,save t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the prove
documentation (type prove &minus;&minus;man) for the full
list of state options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When I tell
prove to save state it writes a file called
&rsquo;.prove&rsquo; (&rsquo;_prove&rsquo; on Windows) in
the current directory. It&rsquo;s a <small>YAML</small>
document so it&rsquo;s quite easy to write tools of your own
that work on the saved test state &minus; but the format
isn&rsquo;t officially documented so it might change without
(much) warning in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Parallel
Testing</b> <br>
If my tests take too long to run I may be able to speed them
up by running multiple test scripts in parallel. This is
particularly effective if the tests are I/O bound or if I
have multiple <small>CPU</small> cores. I tell prove to run
my tests in parallel like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;rb
&minus;j 9 t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The &minus;j
switch enables parallel testing; the number that follows it
is the maximum number of tests to run in parallel. Sometimes
tests that pass when run sequentially will fail when run in
parallel. For example if two different test scripts use the
same temporary file or attempt to listen on the same socket
I&rsquo;ll have problems running them in parallel. If I see
unexpected failures I need to check my tests to work out
which of them are trampling on the same resource and rename
temporary files or add locks as appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To get the most
performance benefit I want to have the test scripts that
take the longest to run start first &minus; otherwise
I&rsquo;ll be waiting for the one test that takes nearly a
minute to complete after all the others are done. I can use
the &minus;&minus;state switch to run the tests in slowest
to fastest order:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;rb
&minus;j 9 &minus;&minus;state=slow,save t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Non-Perl
Tests</b> <br>
The Test Anything Protocol (http://testanything.org/)
isn&rsquo;t just for Perl. Just about any language can be
used to write tests that output <small>TAP.</small> There
are <small>TAP</small> based testing libraries for C, C
<small>++</small> , <small>PHP,</small> Python and many
others. If I can&rsquo;t find a <small>TAP</small> library
for my language of choice it&rsquo;s easy to generate valid
<small>TAP.</small> It looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1..3 <br>
ok 1 &minus; init OK <br>
ok 2 &minus; opened file <br>
not ok 3 &minus; appended to file</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first line
is the plan &minus; it specifies the number of tests
I&rsquo;m going to run so that it&rsquo;s easy to check that
the test script didn&rsquo;t exit before running all the
expected tests. The following lines are the test results
&minus; &rsquo;ok&rsquo; for pass, &rsquo;not ok&rsquo; for
fail. Each test has a number and, optionally, a description.
And that&rsquo;s it. Any language that can produce output
like that on <small>STDOUT</small> can be used to write
tests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Recently
I&rsquo;ve been rekindling a two-decades-old interest in
Forth. Evidently I have a masochistic streak that even Perl
can&rsquo;t satisfy. I want to write tests in Forth and run
them using prove (you can find my gforth <small>TAP</small>
experiments at https://svn.hexten.net/andy/Forth/Testing/).
I can use the &minus;&minus;exec switch to tell prove to run
the tests using gforth like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove &minus;r
&minus;&minus;exec gforth t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternately, if
the language used to write my tests allows a shebang line I
can use that to specify the interpreter. Here&rsquo;s a test
written in <small>PHP:</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/php
<br>
&lt;?php <br>
print &quot;1..2\n&quot;; <br>
print &quot;ok 1\n&quot;; <br>
print &quot;not ok 2\n&quot;; <br>
?&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If I save that
as t/phptest.t the shebang line will ensure that it runs
correctly along with all my other tests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mixing it
up</b> <br>
Subtle interdependencies between test programs can mask
problems &minus; for example an earlier test may neglect to
remove a temporary file that affects the behaviour of a
later test. To find this kind of problem I use the
&minus;&minus;shuffle and &minus;&minus;reverse options to
run my tests in random or reversed order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Rolling My
Own</b> <br>
If I need a feature that prove doesn&rsquo;t provide I can
easily write my own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typically
you&rsquo;ll want to change how <small>TAP</small> gets
<i>input</i> into and <i>output</i> from the parser.
App::Prove supports arbitrary plugins, and TAP::Harness
supports custom <i>formatters</i> and <i>source handlers</i>
that you can load using either prove or Module::Build; there
are many examples to base mine on. For more details see
App::Prove, TAP::Parser::SourceHandler, and
TAP::Formatter::Base.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If writing a
plugin is not enough, you can write your own test harness;
one of the motives for the 3.00 rewrite of Test::Harness was
to make it easier to subclass and extend.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
Test::Harness module is a compatibility wrapper around
TAP::Harness. For new applications I should use TAP::Harness
directly. As we&rsquo;ll see, prove uses TAP::Harness.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When I run
prove it processes its arguments, figures out which test
scripts to run and then passes control to TAP::Harness to
run the tests, parse, analyse and present the results. By
subclassing TAP::Harness I can customise many aspects of the
test run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I want to log
my test results in a database so I can track them over time.
To do this I override the summary method in TAP::Harness. I
start with a simple prototype that dumps the results as a
<small>YAML</small> document:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
My::TAP::Harness; <br>
use base 'TAP::Harness'; <br>
use YAML; <br>
sub summary { <br>
my ( $self, $aggregate ) = @_; <br>
print Dump( $aggregate ); <br>
$self&minus;&gt;SUPER::summary( $aggregate ); <br>
} <br>
1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I need to tell
prove to use my My::TAP::Harness. If My::TAP::Harness is on
Perl&rsquo;s @INC include path I can</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prove
&minus;&minus;harness=My::TAP::Harness &minus;rb t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If I
don&rsquo;t have My::TAP::Harness installed on @INC I need
to provide the correct path to perl when I run prove:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl
&minus;Ilib `which prove`
&minus;&minus;harness=My::TAP::Harness &minus;rb t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I can
incorporate these options into my own version of prove.
It&rsquo;s pretty simple. Most of the work of prove is
handled by App::Prove. The important code in prove is
just:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use App::Prove;
<br>
my $app = App::Prove&minus;&gt;new; <br>
$app&minus;&gt;process_args(@ARGV); <br>
exit( $app&minus;&gt;run ? 0 : 1 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If I write a
subclass of App::Prove I can customise any aspect of the
test runner while inheriting all of prove&rsquo;s behaviour.
Here&rsquo;s myprove:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/env
perl use lib qw( lib ); # Add ./lib to @INC <br>
use App::Prove; <br>
my $app = App::Prove&minus;&gt;new; <br>
# Use custom TAP::Harness subclass <br>
$app&minus;&gt;harness( 'My::TAP::Harness' ); <br>
$app&minus;&gt;process_args( @ARGV ); exit(
$app&minus;&gt;run ? 0 : 1 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now I can run
my tests like this</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">./myprove
&minus;rb t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Deeper
Customisation</b> <br>
Now that I know how to subclass and replace TAP::Harness I
can replace any other part of the harness. To do that I need
to know which classes are responsible for which
functionality. Here&rsquo;s a brief guided tour; the default
class for each component is shown in parentheses. Normally
any replacements I write will be subclasses of these default
classes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When I run my
tests TAP::Harness creates a scheduler
(TAP::Parser::Scheduler) to work out the running order for
the tests, an aggregator (TAP::Parser::Aggregator) to
collect and analyse the test results and a formatter
(TAP::Formatter::Console) to display those results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If I&rsquo;m
running my tests in parallel there may also be a multiplexer
(TAP::Parser::Multiplexer) &minus; the component that allows
multiple tests to run simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once it has
created those helpers TAP::Harness starts running the tests.
For each test it creates a new parser (TAP::Parser) which is
responsible for running the test script and parsing its
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To replace any
of these components I call one of these harness methods with
the name of the replacement class:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">aggregator_class
<br>
formatter_class <br>
multiplexer_class <br>
parser_class <br>
scheduler_class</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
replace the aggregator I would</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$harness&minus;&gt;aggregator_class(
'My::Aggregator' );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternately I
can supply the names of my substitute classes to the
TAP::Harness constructor:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $harness =
TAP::Harness&minus;&gt;new( <br>
{ aggregator_class =&gt; 'My::Aggregator' } <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If I need to
reach even deeper into the internals of the harness I can
replace the classes that TAP::Parser uses to execute test
scripts and tokenise their output. Before running a test
script TAP::Parser creates a grammar (TAP::Parser::Grammar)
to decode the raw <small>TAP</small> into tokens, a result
factory (TAP::Parser::ResultFactory) to turn the decoded
<small>TAP</small> results into objects and, depending on
whether it&rsquo;s running a test script or reading
<small>TAP</small> from a file, scalar or array a source or
an iterator (TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each of these
objects may be replaced by calling one of these parser
methods:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">source_class
<br>
perl_source_class <br>
grammar_class <br>
iterator_factory_class <br>
result_factory_class</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Callbacks</b>
<br>
As an alternative to subclassing the components I need to
change I can attach callbacks to the default classes.
TAP::Harness exposes these callbacks:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">parser_args
Tweak the parameters used to create the parser <br>
made_parser Just made a new parser <br>
before_runtests About to run tests <br>
after_runtests Have run all tests <br>
after_test Have run an individual test script</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">TAP::Parser
also supports callbacks; bailout, comment, plan, test,
unknown, version and yaml are called for the corresponding
<small>TAP</small> result types, <small>ALL</small> is
called for all results, <small>ELSE</small> is called for
all results for which a named callback is not installed and
<small>EOF</small> is called once at the end of each
<small>TAP</small> stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To install a
callback I pass the name of the callback and a subroutine
reference to TAP::Harness or TAP::Parser&rsquo;s callback
method:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$harness&minus;&gt;callback(
after_test =&gt; sub { <br>
my ( $script, $desc, $parser ) = @_; <br>
} );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I can also pass
callbacks to the constructor:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $harness =
TAP::Harness&minus;&gt;new({ <br>
callbacks =&gt; { <br>
after_test =&gt; sub { <br>
my ( $script, $desc, $parser ) = @_; <br>
# Do something interesting here <br>
} <br>
} <br>
});</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When it comes
to altering the behaviour of the test harness there&rsquo;s
more than one way to do it. Which way is best depends on my
requirements. In general if I only want to observe test
execution without changing the harness&rsquo; behaviour (for
example to log test results to a database) I choose
callbacks. If I want to make the harness behave differently
subclassing gives me more control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Parsing
<small>TAP</small></b> <br>
Perhaps I don&rsquo;t need a complete test harness. If I
already have a <small>TAP</small> test log that I need to
parse all I need is TAP::Parser and the various classes it
depends upon. Here&rsquo;s the code I need to run a test and
parse its <small>TAP</small> output</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
TAP::Parser; <br>
my $parser = TAP::Parser&minus;&gt;new( { source =&gt;
't/simple.t' } ); <br>
while ( my $result = $parser&minus;&gt;next ) { <br>
print $result&minus;&gt;as_string, &quot;\n&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternately I
can pass an open filehandle as source and have the parser
read from that rather than attempting to run a test
script:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open my $tap,
'&lt;', 'tests.tap' <br>
or die &quot;Can't read TAP transcript ($!)\n&quot;; <br>
my $parser = TAP::Parser&minus;&gt;new( { source =&gt; $tap
} ); <br>
while ( my $result = $parser&minus;&gt;next ) { <br>
print $result&minus;&gt;as_string, &quot;\n&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This approach
is useful if I need to convert my <small>TAP</small> based
test results into some other representation. See
TAP::Convert::TET
(http://search.cpan.org/dist/TAP&minus;Convert&minus;TET/)
for an example of this approach.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Getting
