&minus; shut down a TLS/SSL connection</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
shuts down an active <small>TLS/SSL</small> connection. It
sends the close_notify shutdown alert to the peer.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
tries to send the close_notify shutdown alert to the peer.
Whether the operation succeeds or not, the
<small>SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN</small> flag is set and a currently
open session is considered closed and good and will be kept
in the session cache for further reuse.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> must not be called if a previous fatal
error has occurred on a connection i.e. if
<b>SSL_get_error()</b> has returned
<small>SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL</small> or
<small>SSL_ERROR_SSL.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The shutdown
procedure consists of two steps: sending of the close_notify
shutdown alert, and reception of the peer&rsquo;s
close_notify shutdown alert. The order of those two steps
depends on the application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
acceptable for an application to only send its shutdown
alert and then close the underlying connection without
waiting for the peer&rsquo;s response. This way resources
can be saved, as the process can already terminate or serve
another connection. This should only be done when it is
known that the other side will not send more data, otherwise
there is a risk of a truncation attack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a client
only writes and never reads from the connection, and the
server has sent a session ticket to establish a session, the
client might not be able to resume the session because it
did not received and process the session ticket from the
server. In case the application wants to be able to resume
the session, it is recommended to do a complete shutdown
procedure (bidirectional close_notify alerts).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
underlying connection shall be used for more communications,
the complete shutdown procedure must be performed, so that
the peers stay synchronized.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
only closes the write direction. It is not possible to call
<b>SSL_write()</b> after calling <b>SSL_shutdown()</b>. The
read direction is closed by the peer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The behaviour
of <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> additionally depends on the
underlying <small>BIO.</small> If the underlying
<small>BIO</small> is <b>blocking</b>, <b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
will only return once the handshake step has been finished
or an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
underlying <small>BIO</small> is <b>nonblocking</b>,
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will also return when the underlying
<small>BIO</small> could not satisfy the needs of
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> to continue the handshake. In this
case a call to <b>SSL_get_error()</b> with the return value
of <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will yield
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</small></b> or
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</small></b> . The calling
process then must repeat the call after taking appropriate
action to satisfy the needs of <b>SSL_shutdown()</b>. The
action depends on the underlying <small>BIO.</small> When
using a nonblocking socket, nothing is to be done, but
<b>select()</b> can be used to check for the required
condition. When using a buffering <small>BIO,</small> like a
<small>BIO</small> pair, data must be written into or
retrieved out of the <small>BIO</small> before being able to
continue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> returned 0, it is possible to call
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> again to wait for the peer&rsquo;s
close_notify alert. <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will return 1 in
that case. However, it is recommended to wait for it using
<b>SSL_read()</b> instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
can be modified to only set the connection to
&quot;shutdown&quot; state but not actually send the
close_notify alert messages, see
<b>SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown</b>(3). When &quot;quiet
shutdown&quot; is enabled, <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will always
succeed and return 1. Note that this is not standard
compliant behaviour. It should only be done when the peer
has a way to make sure all data has been received and
doesn&rsquo;t wait for the close_notify alert message,
otherwise an unexpected <small>EOF</small> will be
reported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
implementations that do not send the required close_notify
alert. If there is a need to communicate with such an
implementation, and it&rsquo;s clear that all data has been
received, do not wait for the peer&rsquo;s close_notify
alert. Waiting for the close_notify alert when the peer just
closes the connection will result in an error being
generated. The error can be ignored using the
<b><small>SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF</small></b> . For
more information see <b>SSL_CTX_set_options</b>(3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>First to
close the connection</b> <br>
When the application is the first party to send the
close_notify alert, <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will only send the
alert and then set the <small>SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN</small> flag
(so that the session is considered good and will be kept in
the cache). If successful, <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will return
0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
unidirectional shutdown is enough (the underlying connection
shall be closed anyway), this first successful call to
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> is sufficient.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
complete the bidirectional shutdown handshake, the peer
needs to send back a close_notify alert. The
<small>SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN</small> flag will be set after
receiving and processing it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The peer is
still allowed to send data after receiving the close_notify
event. When it is done sending data, it will send the
close_notify alert. <b>SSL_read()</b> should be called until
all data is received. <b>SSL_read()</b> will indicate the
end of the peer data by returning &lt;= 0 and
<b>SSL_get_error()</b> returning
<small>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Peer closes
the connection</b> <br>
If the peer already sent the close_notify alert <b>and</b>
it was already processed implicitly inside another function
(<b>SSL_read</b>(3)), the
<small>SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN</small> flag is set.
<b>SSL_read()</b> will return &lt;= 0 in that case, and
<b>SSL_get_error()</b> will return
<small>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN.</small> <b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
will send the close_notify alert, set the
<small>SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN</small> flag. If successful,
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will return 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whether
<small>SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN</small> is already set can be
checked using the <b>SSL_get_shutdown()</b> (see also
<b>SSL_set_shutdown</b>(3) call.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUES
<a name="RETURN VALUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
return values can occur:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>0</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>The shutdown is not yet finished: the close_notify was
sent but the peer did not send it back yet. Call
<b>SSL_read()</b> to do a bidirectional shutdown.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike most
other function, returning 0 does not indicate an error.
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) should not get called, it may
misleadingly indicate an error even though no error
occurred.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">The shutdown was successfully
completed. The close_notify alert was sent and the
peer&rsquo;s close_notify alert was received.</p></td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>&lt;0</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>The shutdown was not successful. Call
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) with the return value <b>ret</b> to
find out the reason. It can occur if an action is needed to
continue the operation for nonblocking BIOs.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It can also
occur when not all data was read using
<b>SSL_read()</b>.</p>
