<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Time::HiRes&quot; module implements a Perl interface
to the &quot;usleep&quot;, &quot;nanosleep&quot;,
&quot;ualarm&quot;, &quot;gettimeofday&quot;, and
&quot;setitimer&quot;/&quot;getitimer&quot; system calls, in
other words, high resolution time and timers. See the &quot;
<small>EXAMPLES&quot;</small> section below and the test
scripts for usage; see your system documentation for the
description of the underlying &quot;nanosleep&quot; or
&quot;usleep&quot;, &quot;ualarm&quot;,
&quot;gettimeofday&quot;, and
&quot;setitimer&quot;/&quot;getitimer&quot; calls.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your system
lacks &quot;gettimeofday()&quot; or an emulation of it you
don&rsquo;t get &quot;gettimeofday()&quot; or the
one-argument form of &quot;tv_interval()&quot;. If your
system lacks all of &quot;nanosleep()&quot;,
&quot;usleep()&quot;, &quot;select()&quot;, and
&quot;poll&quot;, you don&rsquo;t get
&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;,
&quot;Time::HiRes::nanosleep()&quot;, or
&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;. If your system lacks both
&quot;ualarm()&quot; and &quot;setitimer()&quot; you
don&rsquo;t get &quot;Time::HiRes::ualarm()&quot; or
&quot;Time::HiRes::alarm()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you try to
import an unimplemented function in the &quot;use&quot;
statement it will fail at compile time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your
subsecond sleeping is implemented with
&quot;nanosleep()&quot; instead of &quot;usleep()&quot;, you
can mix subsecond sleeping with signals since
&quot;nanosleep()&quot; does not use signals. This, however,
is not portable, and you should first check for the truth
value of &amp;Time::HiRes::d_nanosleep to see whether you
have nanosleep, and then carefully read your
&quot;nanosleep()&quot; C <small>API</small> documentation
for any peculiarities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using &quot;nanosleep&quot; for something else than mixing
sleeping with signals, give some thought to whether Perl is
the tool you should be using for work requiring nanosecond
accuracies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Remember that
unless you are working on a <i>hard realtime</i> system, any
clocks and timers will be imprecise, especially so if you
are working in a pre-emptive multiuser system. Understand
the difference between <i>wallclock time</i> and process
time (in UNIX-like systems the sum of <i>user</i> and
<i>system</i> times). Any attempt to sleep for X seconds
will most probably end up sleeping <b>more</b> than that,
but don&rsquo;t be surprised if you end up sleeping slightly
<b>less</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
functions can be imported from this module. No functions are
exported by default. <br>
gettimeofday ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In array context returns a
two-element array with the seconds and microseconds since
the epoch. In scalar context returns floating seconds like
&quot;Time::HiRes::time()&quot; (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">usleep ( $useconds )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sleeps for the number of
microseconds (millionths of a second) specified. Returns the
number of microseconds actually slept. Can sleep for more
than one second, unlike the &quot;usleep&quot; system call.
Can also sleep for zero seconds, which often works like a
<i>thread yield</i>. See also
&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;, and
&quot;clock_nanosleep()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Do not expect
<b>usleep()</b> to be exact down to one microsecond.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">nanosleep ( $nanoseconds )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sleeps for the number of
nanoseconds (1e9ths of a second) specified. Returns the
number of nanoseconds actually slept (accurate only to
microseconds, the nearest thousand of them). Can sleep for
more than one second. Can also sleep for zero seconds, which
often works like a <i>thread yield</i>. See also
&quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;,
&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;, and
&quot;clock_nanosleep()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Do not expect
<b>nanosleep()</b> to be exact down to one nanosecond.
Getting even accuracy of one thousand nanoseconds is
good.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ualarm ( $useconds [,
$interval_useconds ] )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Issues a &quot;ualarm&quot;
call; the $interval_useconds is optional and will be zero if
unspecified, resulting in &quot;alarm&quot;&minus;like
behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
remaining time in the alarm in microseconds, or
&quot;undef&quot; if an error occurred.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ualarm</b>(0)
will cancel an outstanding <b>ualarm()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
interaction between alarms and sleeps is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">tv_interval</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">tv_interval (
$ref_to_gettimeofday [, $ref_to_later_gettimeofday] )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
floating seconds between the two times, which should have
been returned by &quot;gettimeofday()&quot;. If the second
argument is omitted, then the current time is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">time ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns a floating seconds
since the epoch. This function can be imported, resulting in
a nice drop-in replacement for the &quot;time&quot; provided
with core Perl; see the &quot; <small>EXAMPLES&quot;</small>
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE
1</small></b> : This higher resolution timer can return
values either less or more than the core &quot;time()&quot;,
depending on whether your platform rounds the higher
resolution timer values up, down, or to the nearest second
to get the core &quot;time()&quot;, but naturally the
difference should be never more than half a second. See also
&quot;clock_getres&quot;, if available in your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE
2</small></b> : Since Sunday, September 9th, 2001 at
01:46:40 <small>AM GMT,</small> when the &quot;time()&quot;
seconds since epoch rolled over to 1_000_000_000, the
default floating point format of Perl and the seconds since
epoch have conspired to produce an apparent bug: if you
print the value of &quot;Time::HiRes::time()&quot; you seem
to be getting only five decimals, not six as promised
(microseconds). Not to worry, the microseconds are there
(assuming your platform supports such granularity in the
first place). What is going on is that the default floating
point format of Perl only outputs 15 digits. In this case
that means ten digits before the decimal separator and five
after. To see the microseconds you can use either
&quot;printf&quot;/&quot;sprintf&quot; with
&quot;%.6f&quot;, or the &quot;gettimeofday()&quot; function
in list context, which will give you the seconds and
microseconds as two separate values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sleep ( $floating_seconds )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sleeps for the specified amount
of seconds. Returns the number of seconds actually slept (a
floating point value). This function can be imported,
resulting in a nice drop-in replacement for the
&quot;sleep&quot; provided with perl, see the &quot;
<small>EXAMPLES&quot;</small> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
interaction between alarms and sleeps is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">alarm ( $floating_seconds [,
$interval_floating_seconds ] )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;SIGALRM&quot; signal
is sent after the specified number of seconds. Implemented
using &quot;setitimer()&quot; if available,
&quot;ualarm()&quot; if not. The $interval_floating_seconds
argument is optional and will be zero if unspecified,
resulting in &quot;alarm()&quot;&minus;like behaviour. This
function can be imported, resulting in a nice drop-in
replacement for the &quot;alarm&quot; provided with perl,
see the &quot; <small>EXAMPLES&quot;</small> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
remaining time in the alarm in seconds, or &quot;undef&quot;
if an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE
1</small></b> : With some combinations of operating systems
and Perl releases &quot;SIGALRM&quot; restarts
&quot;select()&quot;, instead of interrupting it. This means
that an &quot;alarm()&quot; followed by a
&quot;select()&quot; may together take the sum of the times
specified for the &quot;alarm()&quot; and the
&quot;select()&quot;, not just the time of the
&quot;alarm()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
interaction between alarms and sleeps is unspecified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">setitimer ( $which,
$floating_seconds [, $interval_floating_seconds ] )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Start up an interval timer:
after a certain time, a signal ($which) arrives, and more
signals may keep arriving at certain intervals. To disable
an &quot;itimer&quot;, use $floating_seconds of zero. If the
$interval_floating_seconds is set to zero (or unspecified),
the timer is disabled <b>after</b> the next delivered
signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use of interval
timers may interfere with &quot;alarm()&quot;,
&quot;sleep()&quot;, and &quot;usleep()&quot;. In
standard-speak the &quot;interaction is unspecified&quot;,
which means that <i>anything</i> may happen: it may work, it
may not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In scalar
context, the remaining time in the timer is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In list
context, both the remaining time and the interval are
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There are
usually three or four interval timers (signals) available:
the $which can be &quot;ITIMER_REAL&quot;,
&quot;ITIMER_VIRTUAL&quot;, &quot;ITIMER_PROF&quot;, or
&quot;ITIMER_REALPROF&quot;. Note that which ones are
available depends: true <small>UNIX</small> platforms
usually have the first three, but only Solaris seems to have
&quot;ITIMER_REALPROF&quot; (which is used to profile
multithreaded programs). Win32 unfortunately does not have
interval timers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;ITIMER_REAL&quot;
results in &quot;alarm()&quot;&minus;like behaviour. Time is
counted in <i>real time</i>; that is, wallclock time.
&quot;SIGALRM&quot; is delivered when the timer expires.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;ITIMER_VIRTUAL&quot;
counts time in (process) <i>virtual time</i>; that is, only
when the process is running. In multiprocessor/user/CPU
systems this may be more or less than real or wallclock
time. (This time is also known as the <i>user time</i>.)
&quot;SIGVTALRM&quot; is delivered when the timer
expires.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;ITIMER_PROF&quot;
counts time when either the process virtual time or when the
operating system is running on behalf of the process (such
as I/O). (This time is also known as the <i>system
time</i>.) (The sum of user time and system time is known as
the <i><small>CPU</small> time</i>.) &quot;SIGPROF&quot; is
delivered when the timer expires. &quot;SIGPROF&quot; can
interrupt system calls.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The semantics
of interval timers for multithreaded programs are
system-specific, and some systems may support additional
interval timers. For example, it is unspecified which thread
gets the signals. See your setitimer(2) documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">getitimer ( $which )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Return the remaining time in
the interval timer specified by $which.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In scalar
context, the remaining time is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In list
context, both the remaining time and the interval are
returned. The interval is always what you put in using
&quot;setitimer()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">clock_gettime ( $which )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Return as seconds the current
value of the <small>POSIX</small> high resolution timer
specified by $which. All implementations that support
<small>POSIX</small> high resolution timers are supposed to
support at least the $which value of
&quot;CLOCK_REALTIME&quot;, which is supposed to return
results close to the results of &quot;gettimeofday&quot;, or
the number of seconds since 00:00:00:00 January 1, 1970
Greenwich Mean Time ( <small>GMT</small> ). Do not assume
that <small>CLOCK_REALTIME</small> is zero, it might be one,
or something else. Another potentially useful (but not
available everywhere) value is &quot;CLOCK_MONOTONIC&quot;,
which guarantees a monotonically increasing time value
(unlike <b>time()</b> or <b>gettimeofday()</b>, which can be
adjusted). See your system documentation for other possibly
supported values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">clock_getres ( $which )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Return as seconds the
resolution of the <small>POSIX</small> high resolution timer
specified by $which. All implementations that support
<small>POSIX</small> high resolution timers are supposed to
support at least the $which value of
&quot;CLOCK_REALTIME&quot;, see
&quot;clock_gettime&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE</small></b>
: the resolution returned may be highly optimistic. Even if
the resolution is high (a small number), all it means is
that you&rsquo;ll be able to specify the arguments to
<b>clock_gettime()</b> and <b>clock_nanosleep()</b> with
that resolution. The system might not actually be able to
measure events at that resolution, and the various overheads
and the overall system load are certain to affect any
timings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">clock_nanosleep ( $which,
$nanoseconds, $flags = 0)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sleeps for the number of
nanoseconds (1e9ths of a second) specified. Returns the
number of nanoseconds actually slept. The $which is the
&quot;clock id&quot;, as with <b>clock_gettime()</b> and
<b>clock_getres()</b>. The flags default to zero but
&quot;TIMER_ABSTIME&quot; can specified (must be exported
explicitly) which means that $nanoseconds is not a time
interval (as is the default) but instead an absolute time.
Can sleep for more than one second. Can also sleep for zero
seconds, which often works like a <i>thread yield</i>. See
also &quot;Time::HiRes::sleep()&quot;,
&quot;Time::HiRes::usleep()&quot;, and
&quot;Time::HiRes::nanosleep()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Do not expect
<b>clock_nanosleep()</b> to be exact down to one nanosecond.
Getting even accuracy of one thousand nanoseconds is
good.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>clock()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Return as seconds the
<i>process time</i> (user + system time) spent by the
process since the first call to <b>clock()</b> (the
definition is <b>not</b> &quot;since the start of the
process&quot;, though if you are lucky these times may be
quite close to each other, depending on the system). What
this means is that you probably need to store the result of
your first call to <b>clock()</b>, and subtract that value
from the following results of <b>clock()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The time
returned also includes the process times of the terminated
child processes for which <b>wait()</b> has been executed.
This value is somewhat like the second value returned by the
<b>times()</b> of core Perl, but not necessarily identical.
Note that due to backward compatibility limitations the
returned value may wrap around at about 2147 seconds or at
about 36 minutes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stat <br>
stat <small>FH</small> <br>
stat <small>EXPR</small> <br>
lstat <br>
lstat <small>FH</small> <br>
lstat <small>EXPR</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As &quot;stat&quot; in perlfunc
or &quot;lstat&quot; in perlfunc but with the
access/modify/change file timestamps in subsecond
resolution, if the operating system and the filesystem both
support such timestamps. To override the standard
<b>stat()</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use Time::HiRes
qw(stat);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Test for the
value of &amp;Time::HiRes::d_hires_stat to find out whether
the operating system supports subsecond file timestamps: a
value larger than zero means yes. There are unfortunately no
easy ways to find out whether the filesystem supports such
timestamps. <small>UNIX</small> filesystems often do;
<small>NTFS</small> does; <small>FAT</small> doesn&rsquo;t (
<small>FAT</small> timestamp granularity is <b>two</b>
seconds).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A zero return
value of &amp;Time::HiRes::d_hires_stat means that
Time::HiRes::stat is a no-op passthrough for
<b>CORE::stat()</b> (and likewise for lstat), and therefore
the timestamps will stay integers. The same thing will
happen if the filesystem does not do subsecond timestamps,
even if the &amp;Time::HiRes::d_hires_stat is non-zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In any case do
not expect nanosecond resolution, or even a microsecond
resolution. Also note that the modify/access timestamps
might have different resolutions, and that they need not be
synchronized, e.g. if the operations are</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">write <br>
stat # t1 <br>
read <br>
stat # t2</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">the access time
stamp from t2 need not be greater-than the modify time stamp
from t1: it may be equal or <i>less</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">utime <small>LIST</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As &quot;utime&quot; in
perlfunc but with the ability to set the access/modify file
timestamps in subsecond resolution, if the operating system
and the filesystem, and the mount options of the filesystem,
all support such timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To override the
standard <b>utime()</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use Time::HiRes
qw(utime);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Test for the
value of &amp;Time::HiRes::d_hires_utime to find out whether
the operating system supports setting subsecond file
timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As with
<b>CORE::utime()</b>, passing undef as both the atime and
mtime will call the syscall with a <small>NULL</small>
argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The actual
achievable subsecond resolution depends on the combination
of the operating system and the filesystem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Modifying the
timestamps may not be possible at all: for example, the
&quot;noatime&quot; filesystem mount option may prohibit you
from changing the access time timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
number of files successfully changed.</p>

Time::U2time void (*)(pTHX_ UV ret[2])</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both functions
return equivalent information (like
&quot;gettimeofday&quot;) but with different
representations. The names &quot;NVtime&quot; and
&quot;U2time&quot; were selected mainly because they are
operating system independent. (&quot;gettimeofday&quot; is
Unix-centric, though some platforms like Win32 and
<small>VMS</small> have emulations for it.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
example of using &quot;NVtime&quot; from C:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NV
(*myNVtime)(); /* Returns &minus;1 on failure. */ <br>
SV **svp = hv_fetchs(PL_modglobal, &quot;Time::NVtime&quot;,
0); <br>
if (!svp) croak(&quot;Time::HiRes is required&quot;); <br>
if (!SvIOK(*svp)) croak(&quot;Time::NVtime isn't a function
pointer&quot;); <br>
myNVtime = INT2PTR(NV(*)(), SvIV(*svp)); <br>
printf(&quot;The current time is: %&quot; NVff
&quot;\n&quot;, (*myNVtime)());</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>useconds or
interval more than ...</b> <br>
In <b>ualarm()</b> you tried to use number of microseconds
or interval (also in microseconds) more than 1_000_000 and
<b>setitimer()</b> is not available in your system to
emulate that case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>negative
time not invented yet</b> <br>
You tried to use a negative time argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>internal
error: useconds &lt; 0 (unsigned ... signed ...)</b> <br>
Something went horribly wrong-- the number of microseconds
that cannot become negative just became negative. Maybe your
compiler is broken?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>useconds or
uinterval equal to or more than 1000000</b> <br>
In some platforms it is not possible to get an alarm with
subsecond resolution and later than one second.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>unimplemented
in this platform</b> <br>
Some calls simply aren&rsquo;t available, real or emulated,
on every platform.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notice that the
core &quot;time()&quot; maybe rounding rather than
truncating. What this means is that the core
&quot;time()&quot; may be reporting the time as one second
later than &quot;gettimeofday()&quot; and
&quot;Time::HiRes::time()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Adjusting the
system clock (either manually or by services like ntp) may
cause problems, especially for long running programs that
assume a monotonously increasing time (note that all
platforms do not adjust time as gracefully as
<small>UNIX</small> ntp does). For example in Win32 (and
derived platforms like Cygwin and MinGW) the
<b>Time::HiRes::time()</b> may temporarily drift off from
the system clock (and the original <b>time()</b>) by up to
0.5 seconds. Time::HiRes will notice this eventually and
recalibrate. Note that since Time::HiRes 1.77 the
clock_gettime( <small>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</small> ) might help
in this (in case your system supports
<small>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some systems
have APIs but not implementations: for example
<small>QNX</small> and Haiku have the interval timer APIs
but not the functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In pre-Sierra
macOS (pre&minus;10.12, <small>OS X</small> )
<b>clock_getres()</b>, <b>clock_gettime()</b> and
<b>clock_nanosleep()</b> are emulated using the Mach timers;
as a side effect of being emulated the
<small>CLOCK_REALTIME</small> and
<small>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</small> are the same timer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gnukfreebsd
seems to have non-functional <b>futimens()</b> and
<b>utimensat()</b> (at least as of 10.1): therefore the
hires <b>utime()</b> does not work.</p>
