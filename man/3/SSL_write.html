<h2>NAME

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SSL_write_ex,
SSL_write, SSL_sendfile &minus; write bytes to a TLS/SSL
connection</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#include
&lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt; <br>
ossl_ssize_t SSL_sendfile(SSL *s, int fd, off_t offset,
size_t size, int flags); <br>
int SSL_write_ex(SSL *s, const void *buf, size_t num, size_t
*written); <br>
int SSL_write(SSL *ssl, const void *buf, int num);</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_write_ex()</b>
and <b>SSL_write()</b> write <b>num</b> bytes from the
buffer <b>buf</b> into the specified <b>ssl</b> connection.
On success <b>SSL_write_ex()</b> will store the number of
bytes written in <b>*written</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_sendfile()</b>
writes <b>size</b> bytes from offset <b>offset</b> in the
file descriptor <b>fd</b> to the specified
<small>SSL</small> connection <b>s</b>. This function
provides efficient zero-copy semantics.
<b>SSL_sendfile()</b> is available only when Kernel
<small>TLS</small> is enabled, which can be checked by
calling <b>BIO_get_ktls_send()</b>. It is provided here to
allow users to maintain the same interface. The meaning of
<b>flags</b> is platform dependent. Currently, under Linux
it is ignored.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
paragraphs below a &quot;write function&quot; is defined as
one of either <b>SSL_write_ex()</b>, or
<b>SSL_write()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If necessary, a
write function will negotiate a <small>TLS/SSL</small>
session, if not already explicitly performed by
<b>SSL_connect</b>(3) or <b>SSL_accept</b>(3). If the peer
requests a re-negotiation, it will be performed
transparently during the write function operation. The
behaviour of the write functions depends on the underlying
<small>BIO.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the
transparent negotiation to succeed, the <b>ssl</b> must have
been initialized to client or server mode. This is being
done by calling <b>SSL_set_connect_state</b>(3) or
<b>SSL_set_accept_state()</b> before the first call to a
write function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
underlying <small>BIO</small> is <b>blocking</b>, the write
functions will only return, once the write operation has
been finished or an error occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
underlying <small>BIO</small> is <b>nonblocking</b> the
write functions will also return when the underlying
<small>BIO</small> could not satisfy the needs of the
function to continue the operation. In this case a call to
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) with the return value of the write
function will yield
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</small></b> or
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</small></b> . As at any time
a re-negotiation is possible, a call to a write function can
also cause read operations! The calling process then must
repeat the call after taking appropriate action to satisfy
the needs of the write function. The action depends on the
underlying <small>BIO.</small> When using a nonblocking
socket, nothing is to be done, but <b>select()</b> can be
used to check for the required condition. When using a
buffering <small>BIO,</small> like a <small>BIO</small>
pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the
<small>BIO</small> before being able to continue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The write
functions will only return with success when the complete
contents of <b>buf</b> of length <b>num</b> has been
written. This default behaviour can be changed with the
<small>SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE</small> option of
<b>SSL_CTX_set_mode</b>(3). When this flag is set the write
functions will also return with success when a partial write
has been successfully completed. In this case the write
function operation is considered completed. The bytes are
sent and a new write call with a new buffer (with the
already sent bytes removed) must be started. A partial write
is performed with the size of a message block, which is
16kB.</p>

<h2>WARNINGS
<a name="WARNINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a write
function call has to be repeated because
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) returned
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</small></b> or
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</small></b> , it must be
repeated with the same arguments. The data that was passed
might have been partially processed. When
<b><small>SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER</small></b>
was set using <b>SSL_CTX_set_mode</b>(3) the pointer can be
different, but the data and length should still be the
same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should not
call <b>SSL_write()</b> with num=0, it will return an error.
<b>SSL_write_ex()</b> can be called with num=0, but will not
send application data to the peer.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUES
<a name="RETURN VALUES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_write_ex()</b>
will return 1 for success or 0 for failure. Success means
that all requested application data bytes have been written
to the <small>SSL</small> connection or, if
<small>SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE</small> is in use, at
least 1 application data byte has been written to the
<small>SSL</small> connection. Failure means that not all
the requested bytes have been written yet (if
<small>SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE</small> is not in use)
or no bytes could be written to the <small>SSL</small>
connection (if <small>SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE</small>
is in use). Failures can be retryable (e.g. the network
write buffer has temporarily filled up) or non-retryable
(e.g. a fatal network error). In the event of a failure call
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) to find out the reason which
indicates whether the call is retryable or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
<b>SSL_write()</b> the following return values can
occur:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>&gt; 0</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>The write operation was successful, the return value is
the number of bytes actually written to the
<small>TLS/SSL</small> connection.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;= 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The write operation was not
successful, because either the connection was closed, an
error occurred or action must be taken by the calling
process. Call <b>SSL_get_error()</b> with the return value
<b>ret</b> to find out the reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Old
documentation indicated a difference between 0 and &minus;1,
and that &minus;1 was retryable. You should instead call
<b>SSL_get_error()</b> to find out if it&rsquo;s
retryable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
<b>SSL_sendfile()</b>, the following return values can
occur: <br>
&gt;= 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The write operation was
successful, the return value is the number of bytes of the
file written to the <small>TLS/SSL</small> connection. The
return value can be less than <b>size</b> for a partial
write.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>&lt; 0</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>The write operation was not successful, because either
the connection was closed, an error occurred or action must
be taken by the calling process. Call <b>SSL_get_error()</b>
with the return value to find out the reason.</p></td></tr>
