<h2>STRUCTURES
<a name="STRUCTURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
for <b>SelectionRequest</b> events contains:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
int type; /* SelectionRequest */ <br>
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ <br>
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ <br>
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */ <br>
Window owner; <br>
Window requestor; <br>
Atom selection; <br>
Atom target; <br>
Atom property; <br>
Time time; <br>
} XSelectionRequestEvent;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive this event, the structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> event to a client application, it
sends an <b>XGraphicsExposeEvent</b> structure with the type
member set to <b>GraphicsExpose</b>. The display member is
set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The
send_event member is set to <b>True</b> if the event came
from a <b>SendEvent</b> protocol request. The serial member
is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The owner
member is set to the window that was specified by the
current owner in its <b>XSetSelectionOwner</b> call. The
requestor member is set to the window requesting the
selection. The selection member is set to the atom that
names the selection. For example, PRIMARY is used to
indicate the primary selection. The target member is set to
the atom that indicates the type the selection is desired
in. The property member can be a property name or
<b>None</b>. The time member is set to the timestamp or
<b>CurrentTime</b> value from the <b>ConvertSelection</b>
request.</p>
