<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SSL_get_error
&minus; obtain result code for TLS/SSL I/O operation</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#include
&lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt; <br>
int SSL_get_error(const SSL *ssl, int ret);</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_get_error()</b>
returns a result code (suitable for the C &quot;switch&quot;
statement) for a preceding call to <b>SSL_connect()</b>,
<b>SSL_accept()</b>, <b>SSL_do_handshake()</b>,
<b>SSL_read_ex()</b>, <b>SSL_read()</b>,
<b>SSL_peek_ex()</b>, <b>SSL_peek()</b>,
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b>, <b>SSL_write_ex()</b> or
<b>SSL_write()</b> on <b>ssl</b>. The value returned by that
<small>TLS/SSL I/O</small> function must be passed to
<b>SSL_get_error()</b> in parameter <b>ret</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
<b>ssl</b> and <b>ret</b>, <b>SSL_get_error()</b> inspects
the current thread&rsquo;s OpenSSL error queue. Thus,
<b>SSL_get_error()</b> must be used in the same thread that
performed the <small>TLS/SSL I/O</small> operation, and no
other OpenSSL function calls should appear in between. The
current thread&rsquo;s error queue must be empty before the
<small>TLS/SSL I/O</small> operation is attempted, or
<b>SSL_get_error()</b> will not work reliably.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
<small>TLS</small> implementations do not send a
close_notify alert on shutdown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On an
unexpected <small>EOF,</small> versions before OpenSSL 3.0
returned <b><small>SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL</small></b> , nothing
was added to the error stack, and errno was 0. Since OpenSSL
3.0 the returned error is
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_SSL</small></b> with a meaningful error
on the error stack.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUES
<a name="RETURN VALUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
return values can currently occur: <small><br>
SSL_ERROR_NONE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <small>TLS/SSL I/O</small>
operation completed. This result code is returned if and
only if <b>ret &gt; 0</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <small>TLS/SSL</small> peer
has closed the connection for writing by sending the
close_notify alert. No more data can be read. Note that
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN</small></b> does not
necessarily indicate that the underlying transport has been
closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This error can
also appear when the option
<b><small>SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF</small></b> is set.
See <b>SSL_CTX_set_options</b>(3) for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ,
SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The operation did not complete
and can be retried later.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</small></b>
is returned when the last operation was a read operation
from a nonblocking <b><small>BIO</small></b> . It means that
not enough data was available at this time to complete the
operation. If at a later time the underlying
<b><small>BIO</small></b> has data available for reading the
same function can be called again.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_read()</b>
and <b>SSL_read_ex()</b> can also set
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</small></b> when there is
still unprocessed data available at either the
<b><small>SSL</small></b> or the <b><small>BIO</small></b>
layer, even for a blocking <b><small>BIO</small></b> . See
<b>SSL_read</b>(3) for more information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</small></b>
is returned when the last operation was a write to a
nonblocking <b><small>BIO</small></b> and it was unable to
sent all data to the <b><small>BIO</small></b> . When the
<b><small>BIO</small></b> is writable again, the same
function can be called again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
retry may again lead to an
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</small></b> or
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</small></b> condition. There
is no fixed upper limit for the number of iterations that
may be necessary until progress becomes visible at
application protocol level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is safe to
call <b>SSL_read()</b> or <b>SSL_read_ex()</b> when more
data is available even when the call that set this error was
an <b>SSL_write()</b> or <b>SSL_write_ex()</b>. However, if
the call was an <b>SSL_write()</b> or <b>SSL_write_ex()</b>,
it should be called again to continue sending the
application data. If you get
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</small></b> from
<b>SSL_write()</b> or <b>SSL_write_ex()</b> then you should
not do any other operation that could trigger
<b><small>IO</small></b> other than to repeat the previous
<b>SSL_write()</b> call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For socket
<b><small>BIO</small></b> s (e.g. when <b>SSL_set_fd()</b>
was used), <b>select()</b> or <b>poll()</b> on the
underlying socket can be used to find out when the
<small>TLS/SSL I/O</small> function should be retried.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Caveat: Any
<small>TLS/SSL I/O</small> function can lead to either of
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</small></b> and
<b><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</small></b> . In particular,
<b>SSL_read_ex()</b>, <b>SSL_read()</b>,
<b>SSL_peek_ex()</b>, or <b>SSL_peek()</b> may want to write
data and <b>SSL_write()</b> or <b>SSL_write_ex()</b> may
want to read data. This is mainly because
<small>TLS/SSL</small> handshakes may occur at any time
during the protocol (initiated by either the client or the
server); <b>SSL_read_ex()</b>, <b>SSL_read()</b>,
<b>SSL_peek_ex()</b>, <b>SSL_peek()</b>,
<b>SSL_write_ex()</b>, and <b>SSL_write()</b> will handle
any pending handshakes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_CONNECT,
SSL_ERROR_WANT_ACCEPT</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The operation did not complete;
the same <small>TLS/SSL I/O</small> function should be
called again later. The underlying <small>BIO</small> was
not connected yet to the peer and the call would block in
<b>connect()</b>/<b>accept()</b>. The <small>SSL</small>
function should be called again when the connection is
established. These messages can only appear with a
<b>BIO_s_connect()</b> or <b>BIO_s_accept()</b>
<small>BIO,</small> respectively. In order to find out, when
the connection has been successfully established, on many
platforms <b>select()</b> or <b>poll()</b> for writing on
the socket file descriptor can be used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_X509_LOOKUP</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The operation did not complete
because an application callback set by
<b>SSL_CTX_set_client_cert_cb()</b> has asked to be called
again. The <small>TLS/SSL I/O</small> function should be
called again later. Details depend on the application.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The operation did not complete
because an asynchronous engine is still processing data.
This will only occur if the mode has been set to
<small>SSL_MODE_ASYNC</small> using
<b>SSL_CTX_set_mode</b>(3) or <b>SSL_set_mode</b>(3) and an
asynchronous capable engine is being used. An application
can determine whether the engine has completed its
processing using <b>select()</b> or <b>poll()</b> on the
asynchronous wait file descriptor. This file descriptor is
available by calling <b>SSL_get_all_async_fds</b>(3) or
<b>SSL_get_changed_async_fds</b>(3). The <small>TLS/SSL
I/O</small> function should be called again later. The
function <b>must</b> be called from the same thread that the
original call was made from.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC_JOB</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The asynchronous job could not
be started because there were no async jobs available in the
pool (see <b>ASYNC_init_thread</b>(3)). This will only occur
if the mode has been set to <small>SSL_MODE_ASYNC</small>
using <b>SSL_CTX_set_mode</b>(3) or <b>SSL_set_mode</b>(3)
and a maximum limit has been set on the async job pool
through a call to <b>ASYNC_init_thread</b>(3). The
application should retry the operation after a currently
executing asynchronous operation for the current thread has
completed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_ERROR_WANT_CLIENT_HELLO_CB</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The operation did not complete
because an application callback set by
<b>SSL_CTX_set_client_hello_cb()</b> has asked to be called
again. The <small>TLS/SSL I/O</small> function should be
called again later. Details depend on the application.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some non-recoverable, fatal I/O
error occurred. The OpenSSL error queue may contain more
information on the error. For socket I/O on Unix systems,
consult <b>errno</b> for details. If this error occurs then
no further I/O operations should be performed on the
connection and <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> must not be called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This value can
also be returned for other errors, check the error queue for
details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_ERROR_SSL</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A non-recoverable, fatal error
in the <small>SSL</small> library occurred, usually a
protocol error. The OpenSSL error queue contains more
information on the error. If this error occurs then no
further I/O operations should be performed on the connection
and <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> must not be called.</p>
