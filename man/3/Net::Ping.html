<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
contains methods to test the reachability of remote hosts on
a network. A ping object is first created with optional
parameters, a variable number of hosts may be pinged
multiple times and then the connection is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may choose
one of six different protocols to use for the ping. The
&quot;tcp&quot; protocol is the default. Note that a live
remote host may still fail to be pingable by one or more of
these protocols. For example, www.microsoft.com is generally
alive but not &quot;icmp&quot; pingable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With the
&quot;tcp&quot; protocol the <b>ping()</b> method attempts
to establish a connection to the remote host&rsquo;s echo
port. If the connection is successfully established, the
remote host is considered reachable. No data is actually
echoed. This protocol does not require any special
privileges but has higher overhead than the &quot;udp&quot;
and &quot;icmp&quot; protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Specifying the
&quot;udp&quot; protocol causes the <b>ping()</b> method to
send a udp packet to the remote host&rsquo;s echo port. If
the echoed packet is received from the remote host and the
received packet contains the same data as the packet that
was sent, the remote host is considered reachable. This
protocol does not require any special privileges. It should
be borne in mind that, for a udp ping, a host will be
reported as unreachable if it is not running the appropriate
echo service. For Unix-like systems see <b>inetd</b>(8) for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;icmp&quot; protocol is specified, the <b>ping()</b>
method sends an icmp echo message to the remote host, which
is what the <small>UNIX</small> ping program does. If the
echoed message is received from the remote host and the
echoed information is correct, the remote host is considered
reachable. Specifying the &quot;icmp&quot; protocol requires
that the program be run as root or that the program be
setuid to root.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;external&quot; protocol is specified, the
<b>ping()</b> method attempts to use the
&quot;Net::Ping::External&quot; module to ping the remote
host. &quot;Net::Ping::External&quot; interfaces with your
system&rsquo;s default &quot;ping&quot; utility to perform
the ping, and generally produces relatively accurate
results. If &quot;Net::Ping::External&quot; if not installed
on your system, specifying the &quot;external&quot; protocol
will result in an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;syn&quot; protocol is specified, the &quot;ping&quot;
method will only send a <small>TCP SYN</small> packet to the
remote host then immediately return. If the syn packet was
sent successfully, it will return a true value, otherwise it
will return false. <small>NOTE:</small> Unlike the other
protocols, the return value does <small>NOT</small>
determine if the remote host is alive or not since the full
<small>TCP</small> three-way handshake may not have
completed yet. The remote host is only considered reachable
if it receives a <small>TCP ACK</small> within the timeout
specified. To begin waiting for the <small>ACK</small>
packets, use the &quot;ack&quot; method as explained below.
Use the &quot;syn&quot; protocol instead the &quot;tcp&quot;
protocol to determine reachability of multiple destinations
simultaneously by sending parallel <small>TCP SYN</small>
packets. It will not block while testing each remote host.
This protocol does not require any special privileges.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Functions</b>
<br>
Net::Ping&minus;&gt;new([proto, timeout, bytes, device, tos,
ttl, family, host, <br>
port, bind, gateway, retrans, pingstring, source_verify
econnrefused <br>
dontfrag <small>IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU IPV6_RECVPATHMTU</small>
])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a new ping object. All
of the parameters are optional and can be passed as hash
ref. All options besides the first 7 must be passed as hash
ref.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;proto&quot;
specifies the protocol to use when doing a ping. The current
choices are &quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;udp&quot;,
&quot;icmp&quot;, &quot;icmpv6&quot;, &quot;stream&quot;,
&quot;syn&quot;, or &quot;external&quot;. The default is
&quot;tcp&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a
&quot;timeout&quot; in seconds is provided, it is used when
a timeout is not given to the <b>ping()</b> method (below).
The timeout must be greater than 0 and the default, if not
specified, is 5 seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the number
of data bytes (&quot;bytes&quot;) is given, that many data
bytes are included in the ping packet sent to the remote
host. The number of data bytes is ignored if the protocol is
&quot;tcp&quot;. The minimum (and default) number of data
bytes is 1 if the protocol is &quot;udp&quot; and 0
otherwise. The maximum number of data bytes that can be
specified is 65535, but staying below the <small>MTU</small>
(1472 bytes for <small>ICMP</small> ) is recommended. Many
small devices cannot deal with fragmented
<small>ICMP</small> packets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;device&quot; is given, this device is used to bind the
source endpoint before sending the ping packet. I believe
this only works with superuser privileges and with udp and
icmp protocols at this time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If &lt;tos&gt;
is given, this ToS is configured into the socket.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For icmp,
&quot;ttl&quot; can be specified to set the
<small>TTL</small> of the outgoing packet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Valid
&quot;family&quot; values for IPv4:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4, v4, ip4,
ipv4, AF_INET (constant)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Valid
&quot;family&quot; values for IPv6:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">6, v6, ip6,
ipv6, AF_INET6 (constant)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;host&quot; argument implicitly specifies the family if
the family argument is not given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;port&quot; argument is only valid for a udp, tcp or
stream ping, and will not do what you think it does. ping
returns true when we get a &quot;Connection refused&quot;!
The default is the echo port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;bind&quot; argument specifies the local_addr to bind
to. By specifying a bind argument you don&rsquo;t need the
bind method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;gateway&quot; argument is only valid for IPv6, and
requires a IPv6 address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;retrans&quot; argument the exponential backoff rate,
default 1.2. It matches the $def_factor global.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;dontfrag&quot; argument sets the
<small>IP_DONTFRAG</small> bit, but note that
<small>IP_DONTFRAG</small> is not yet defined by Socket, and
not available on many systems. Then it is ignored. On linux
it also sets <small>IP_MTU_DISCOVER</small> to
<small>IP_PMTUDISC_DO</small> but need we don&rsquo;t chunk
oversized packets. You need to set $data_size manually.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping($host [,
$timeout [, $family]]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ping the remote host and wait
for a response. $host can be either the hostname or the
<small>IP</small> number of the remote host. The optional
timeout must be greater than 0 seconds and defaults to
whatever was specified when the ping object was created.
Returns a success flag. If the hostname cannot be found or
there is a problem with the <small>IP</small> number, the
success flag returned will be undef. Otherwise, the success
flag will be 1 if the host is reachable and 0 if it is not.
For most practical purposes, undef and 0 and can be treated
as the same case. In array context, the elapsed time as well
as the string form of the ip the host resolved to are also
returned. The elapsed time value will be a float, as
returned by the <b>Time::HiRes::time()</b> function, if
<b>hires()</b> has been previously called, otherwise it is
returned as an integer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;source_verify( { 0
| 1 } );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allows source endpoint
verification to be enabled or disabled. This is useful for
those remote destinations with multiples interfaces where
the response may not originate from the same endpoint that
the original destination endpoint was sent to. This only
affects udp and icmp protocol pings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is enabled
by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;service_check( { 0
| 1 } );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set whether or not the connect
behavior should enforce remote service availability as well
as reachability. Normally, if the remote server reported
<small>ECONNREFUSED,</small> it must have been reachable
because of the status packet that it reported. With this
option enabled, the full three-way tcp handshake must have
been established successfully before it will claim it is
reachable. <small>NOTE:</small> It still does nothing more
than connect and disconnect. It does not speak any protocol
(i.e., <small>HTTP</small> or <small>FTP</small> ) to ensure
the remote server is sane in any way. The remote server
<small>CPU</small> could be grinding to a halt and
unresponsive to any clients connecting, but if the kernel
throws the <small>ACK</small> packet, it is considered alive
anyway. To really determine if the server is responding well
would be application specific and is beyond the scope of
Net::Ping. For udp protocol, enabling this option demands
that the remote server replies with the same udp data that
it was sent as defined by the udp echo service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This affects
the &quot;udp&quot;, &quot;tcp&quot;, and &quot;syn&quot;
protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is
disabled by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;tcp_service_check(
{ 0 | 1 } );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Deprecated method, but does the
same as <b>service_check()</b> method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;hires( { 0 | 1 }
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With 1 causes this module to
use Time::HiRes module, allowing milliseconds to be returned
by subsequent calls to <b>ping()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;time</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The current time, hires or
not.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;socket_blocking_mode(
$fh, $mode );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets or clears the O_NONBLOCK
flag on a file handle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;
<small>IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With argument sets the option.
Without returns the option value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;
<small>IPV6_RECVPATHMTU</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Notify an according IPv6
<small>MTU.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With argument
sets the option. Without returns the option value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;
<small>IPV6_HOPLIMIT</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With argument sets the option.
Without returns the option value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;
<small>IPV6_REACHCONF <i>NYI</i></small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets ipv6 reachability
<small>IPV6_REACHCONF</small> was removed in
<small>RFC3542.</small> ping6 &minus;R supports it.
<small>IPV6_REACHCONF</small> requires root/admin
permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With argument
sets the option. Without returns the option value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Not yet
implemented.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;bind($local_addr);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the source address from
which pings will be sent. This must be the address of one of
the interfaces on the local host. $local_addr may be
specified as a hostname or as a text <small>IP</small>
address such as &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the protocol
is set to &quot;tcp&quot;, this method may be called any
number of times, and each call to the <b>ping()</b> method
(below) will use the most recent $local_addr. If the
protocol is &quot;icmp&quot; or &quot;udp&quot;, then
<b>bind()</b> must be called at most once per object, and
(if it is called at all) must be called before the first
call to <b>ping()</b> for that object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>bind()</b> call can be omitted when specifying the
&quot;bind&quot; option to <b>new()</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;message_type([$ping_type]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When you are using the
&quot;icmp&quot; protocol, this call permit to change the
message type to &rsquo;echo&rsquo; or
&rsquo;timestamp&rsquo; (only for IPv4, see <small>RFC
792</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Without
argument, it returns the currently used icmp protocol
message type. By default, it returns &rsquo;echo&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;open($host);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When you are using the
&quot;stream&quot; protocol, this call pre-opens the tcp
socket. It&rsquo;s only necessary to do this if you want to
provide a different timeout when creating the connection, or
remove the overhead of establishing the connection from the
first ping. If you don&rsquo;t call &quot;open()&quot;, the
connection is automatically opened the first time
&quot;ping()&quot; is called. This call simply does nothing
if you are using any protocol other than stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The $host
argument can be omitted when specifying the &quot;host&quot;
option to <b>new()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ack( [ $host ]
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When using the &quot;syn&quot;
protocol, use this method to determine the reachability of
the remote host. This method is meant to be called up to as
many times as <b>ping()</b> was called. Each call returns
the host (as passed to <b>ping()</b>) that came back with
the <small>TCP ACK.</small> The order in which the hosts are
returned may not necessarily be the same order in which they
were <small>SYN</small> queued using the <b>ping()</b>
method. If the timeout is reached before the <small>TCP
ACK</small> is received, or if the remote host is not
listening on the port attempted, then the <small>TCP</small>
connection will not be established and <b>ack()</b> will
return undef. In list context, the host, the ack time, the
dotted ip string, and the port number will be returned
instead of just the host. If the optional $host argument is
specified, the return value will be pertaining to that host
only. This call simply does nothing if you are using any
protocol other than &quot;syn&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
&quot;new&quot; had a host option, this host will be used.
Without $host argument, all hosts are scanned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;nack(
$failed_ack_host );</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The reason that &quot;host
$failed_ack_host&quot; did not receive a valid
<small>ACK.</small> Useful to find out why when
&quot;ack($fail_ack_host)&quot; returns a false value.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ack_unfork($host)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The variant called by
&quot;ack&quot; with the &quot;syn&quot; protocol and
$syn_forking enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping_icmp([$host,
$timeout, $family])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;ping&quot; method
used with the icmp protocol.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping_icmpv6([$host,
$timeout, $family])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;ping&quot; method
used with the icmpv6 protocol.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping_stream([$host,
$timeout, $family])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;ping&quot; method
used with the stream protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perform a
stream ping. If the tcp connection isn&rsquo;t already open,
it opens it. It then sends some data and waits for a reply.
It leaves the stream open on exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping_syn([$host,
$ip, $start_time, $stop_time])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;ping&quot; method
used with the syn protocol. Sends a <small>TCP SYN</small>
packet to host specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping_syn_fork([$host,
$timeout, $family])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;ping&quot; method
used with the forking syn protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping_tcp([$host,
$timeout, $family])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;ping&quot; method
used with the tcp protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping_udp([$host,
$timeout, $family])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;ping&quot; method
used with the udp protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perform a udp
echo ping. Construct a message of at least the one-byte
sequence number and any additional data bytes. Send the
message out and wait for a message to come back. If we get a
message, make sure all of its parts match. If they do, we
are done. Otherwise go back and wait for the message until
we run out of time. Return the result of our efforts.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ping_external([$host,
$timeout, $family])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;ping&quot; method
used with the external protocol. Uses Net::Ping::External to
do an external ping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;tcp_connect([$ip,
$timeout])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Initiates a <small>TCP</small>
connection, for a tcp ping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;tcp_echo([$ip,
$timeout, $pingstring])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Performs a <small>TCP</small>
echo. It writes the given string to the socket and then
reads it back. It returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;<b>close()</b>;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Close the network connection
for this ping object. The network connection is also closed
by &quot;undef $p&quot;. The network connection is
automatically closed if the ping object goes out of scope
(e.g. $p is local to a subroutine and you leave the
subroutine).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;port_number([$port_number])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When called with a port number,
the port number used to ping is set to $port_number rather
than using the echo port. It also has the effect of calling
&quot;$p&minus;&gt;service_check(1)&quot; causing a ping to
return a successful response only if that specific port is
accessible. This function returns the value of the port that
&quot;ping&quot; will connect to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;mselect</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A &quot;select()&quot; wrapper
that compensates for platform peculiarities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;ntop</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Platform abstraction over
&quot;inet_ntop()&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;checksum($msg)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do a checksum on the message.
Basically sum all of the short words and fold the high order
bits into the low order bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$p&minus;&gt;icmp_result</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Returns a list of addr, type,
subcode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pingecho($host [,
$timeout]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To provide backward
compatibility with the previous version of Net::Ping, a
&quot;pingecho()&quot; subroutine is available with the same
functionality as before. &quot;pingecho()&quot; uses the tcp
protocol. The return values and parameters are the same as
described for the &quot;ping&quot; method. This subroutine
is obsolete and may be removed in a future version of
Net::Ping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">wakeonlan($mac, [$host,
[$port]])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Emit the popular wake-on-lan
magic udp packet to wake up a local device. See also
Net::Wake, but this has the mac address as 1st arg. $host

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There will be
less network overhead (and some efficiency in your program)
if you specify either the udp or the icmp protocol. The tcp
protocol will generate 2.5 times or more traffic for each
ping than either udp or icmp. If many hosts are pinged
frequently, you may wish to implement a small wait (e.g.
25ms or more) between each ping to avoid flooding your
network with packets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The icmp and
icmpv6 protocols requires that the program be run as root or
that it be setuid to root. The other protocols do not
require special privileges, but not all network devices
implement tcp or udp echo.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Local hosts
should normally respond to pings within milliseconds.
However, on a very congested network it may take up to 3
seconds or longer to receive an echo packet from the remote
host. If the timeout is set too low under these conditions,
it will appear that the remote host is not reachable (which
is almost the truth).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reachability
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the remote host is
actually functioning beyond its ability to echo packets. tcp
is slightly better at indicating the health of a system than
icmp because it uses more of the networking stack to
respond.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of a
lack of anything better, this module uses its own routines
to pack and unpack <small>ICMP</small> packets. It would be
better for a separate module to be written which understands
all of the different kinds of <small>ICMP</small>
packets.</p>
