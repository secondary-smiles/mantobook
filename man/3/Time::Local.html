<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module
provides functions that are the inverse of built-in perl
functions &quot;localtime()&quot; and &quot;gmtime()&quot;.
They accept a date as a six-element array, and return the
corresponding time(2) value in seconds since the system
epoch (Midnight, January 1, 1970 <small>GMT</small> on Unix,
for example). This value can be positive or negative, though
<small>POSIX</small> only requires support for positive
values, so dates before the system&rsquo;s epoch may not
work on all operating systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is worth
drawing particular attention to the expected ranges for the
values provided. The value for the day of the month is the
actual day (i.e. 1..31), while the month is the number of
months since January (0..11). This is consistent with the
values returned from &quot;localtime()&quot; and
&quot;gmtime()&quot;.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;timelocal_posix()&quot;
and &quot;timegm_posix()&quot;</b> <br>
These functions are the exact inverse of Perl&rsquo;s
built-in &quot;localtime&quot; and &quot;gmtime&quot;
functions. That means that calling &quot;timelocal_posix(
localtime($value) )&quot; will always give you the same
$value you started with. The same applies to
&quot;timegm_posix( gmtime($value) )&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The one
exception is when the value returned from
&quot;localtime()&quot; represents an ambiguous local time
because of a <small>DST</small> change. See the
documentation below for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
expect the year value to be the number of years since 1900,
which is what the &quot;localtime()&quot; and
&quot;gmtime()&quot; built-ins returns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">They perform
range checking by default on the input $sec, $min, $hour,
$mday, and $mon values and will croak (using
&quot;Carp::croak()&quot;) if given a value outside the
allowed ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While it would
be nice to make this the default behavior, that would almost
certainly break a lot of code, so you must explicitly import
these functions and use them instead of the default
&quot;timelocal()&quot; and &quot;timegm()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are
<b>strongly</b> encouraged to use these functions in any new
code which uses this module. It will almost certainly make
your code&rsquo;s behavior less surprising.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;timelocal_modern()&quot;
and &quot;timegm_modern()&quot;</b> <br>
When &quot;Time::Local&quot; was first written, it was a
common practice to represent years as a two-digit value like
99 for 1999 or 1 for 2001. This caused all sorts of problems
(google &quot;Y2K problem&quot; if you&rsquo;re very young)
and developers eventually realized that this was a terrible
idea.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
exports of &quot;timelocal()&quot; and &quot;timegm()&quot;
do a complicated calculation when given a year value less
than 1000. This leads to surprising results in many cases.
See &quot;Year Value Interpretation&quot; for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;time*_modern()&quot; functions do not do this year
munging and simply take the year value as provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">They perform
range checking by default on the input $sec, $min, $hour,
$mday, and $mon values and will croak (using
&quot;Carp::croak()&quot;) if given a value outside the
allowed ranges.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;timelocal()&quot;
and &quot;timegm()&quot;</b> <br>
This module exports two functions by default,
&quot;timelocal()&quot; and &quot;timegm()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">They perform
range checking by default on the input $sec, $min, $hour,
$mday, and $mon values and will croak (using
&quot;Carp::croak()&quot;) if given a value outside the
allowed ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning: The
year value interpretation that these functions and their
nocheck variants use will almost certainly lead to bugs in
your code, if not now, then in the future. You are strongly
discouraged from using these in new code, and you should
convert old code to using either the *_posix or *_modern
functions if possible.</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;timelocal_nocheck()&quot;
and &quot;timegm_nocheck()&quot;</b> <br>
If you are working with data you know to be valid, you can
use the &quot;nocheck&quot; variants,
&quot;timelocal_nocheck()&quot; and
&quot;timegm_nocheck()&quot;. These variants must be
explicitly imported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you supply
data which is not valid (month 27, second 1,000) the results
will be unpredictable (so don&rsquo;t do that).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that my
benchmarks show that this is just a 3% speed increase over
the checked versions, so unless calling
&quot;Time::Local&quot; is the hottest spot in your
application, using these nocheck variants is unlikely to
have much impact on your application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Year Value
Interpretation <br>
This does not apply to the *_posix or *_modern functions.
Use those exports if you want to ensure consistent behavior
as your code ages.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Strictly
speaking, the year should be specified in a form consistent
with &quot;localtime()&quot;, i.e. the offset from 1900. In
order to make the interpretation of the year easier for
humans, however, who are more accustomed to seeing years as
two-digit or four-digit values, the following conventions
are followed:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Years greater than 999 are interpreted as being the
actual year, rather than the offset from 1900. Thus, 1964
would indicate the year Martin Luther King won the Nobel
prize, not the year 3864.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Years in the range 100..999 are interpreted as offset
from 1900, so that 112 indicates 2012. This rule also
applies to years less than zero (but see note below
regarding date range).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Years in the range 0..99 are interpreted as shorthand
for years in the rolling &quot;current century,&quot;
defined as 50 years on either side of the current year.
Thus, today, in 1999, 0 would refer to 2000, and 45 to 2045,
but 55 would refer to 1955. Twenty years from now, 55 would
instead refer to 2055. This is messy, but matches the way
people currently think about two digit dates. Whenever
possible, use an absolute four digit year instead.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The scheme
above allows interpretation of a wide range of dates,
particularly if 4&minus;digit years are used. But it also
means that the behavior of your code changes as time passes,
because the rolling &quot;current century&quot; changes each
year.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Limits of
time_t</b> <br>
On perl versions older than 5.12.0, the range of dates that
can be actually be handled depends on the size of
&quot;time_t&quot; (usually a signed integer) on the given
platform. Currently, this is 32 bits for most systems,
yielding an approximate range from Dec 1901 to Jan 2038.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both
&quot;timelocal()&quot; and &quot;timegm()&quot; croak if
given dates outside the supported range.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of version
5.12.0, perl has stopped using the time implementation of
the operating system it&rsquo;s running on. Instead, it has
its own implementation of those routines with a safe range
of at least +/&minus; 2**52 (about 142 million years)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ambiguous
Local Times ( <small>DST</small> )</b> <br>
Because of <small>DST</small> changes, there are many time
zones where the same local time occurs for two different
<small>GMT</small> times on the same day. For example, in
the &quot;Europe/Paris&quot; time zone, the local time of
2001&minus;10&minus;28 02:30:00 can represent either
2001&minus;10&minus;28 00:30:00 <small>GMT,</small>
<b>or</b> 2001&minus;10&minus;28 01:30:00
<small>GMT.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When given an
ambiguous local time, the <b>timelocal()</b> function will
always return the epoch for the <i>earlier</i> of the two
possible <small>GMT</small> times.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Non-Existent
Local Times ( <small>DST</small> )</b> <br>
When a <small>DST</small> change causes a locale clock to
skip one hour forward, there will be an hour&rsquo;s worth
of local times that don&rsquo;t exist. Again, for the
&quot;Europe/Paris&quot; time zone, the local clock jumped
from 2001&minus;03&minus;25 01:59:59 to
2001&minus;03&minus;25 03:00:00.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;timelocal()&quot; function is given a non-existent
local time, it will simply return an epoch value for the
time one hour later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Negative
Epoch Values</b> <br>
On perl version 5.12.0 and newer, negative epoch values are
fully supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On older
versions of perl, negative epoch (&quot;time_t&quot;)
values, which are not officially supported by the
<small>POSIX</small> standards, are known not to work on
some systems. These include MacOS (pre-OSX) and Win32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On systems
which do support negative epoch values, this module should
be able to cope with dates before the start of the epoch,
down the minimum value of time_t for the system.</p>

<h2>IMPLEMENTATION
<a name="IMPLEMENTATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These routines
are quite efficient and yet are always guaranteed to agree
with &quot;localtime()&quot; and &quot;gmtime()&quot;. We
manage this by caching the start times of any months
we&rsquo;ve seen before. If we know the start time of the
month, we can always calculate any time within the month.
The start times are calculated using a mathematical formula.
Unlike other algorithms that do multiple calls to
&quot;gmtime()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;timelocal()&quot; function is implemented using the
same cache. We just assume that we&rsquo;re translating a
<small>GMT</small> time, and then fudge it when we&rsquo;re
done for the timezone and daylight savings arguments. Note
that the timezone is evaluated for each date because
countries occasionally change their official timezones.
Assuming that &quot;localtime()&quot; corrects for these
changes, this routine will also be correct.</p>
