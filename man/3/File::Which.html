<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">File::Which
finds the full or relative paths to executable programs on
the system. This is normally the function of
&quot;which&quot; utility. &quot;which&quot; is typically
implemented as either a program or a built in shell command.
On some platforms, such as Microsoft Windows it is not
provided as part of the core operating system. This module
provides a consistent <small>API</small> to this
functionality regardless of the underlying platform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The focus of
this module is correctness and portability. As a consequence
platforms where the current directory is implicitly part of
the search path such as Microsoft Windows will find
executables in the current directory, whereas on platforms
such as <small>UNIX</small> where this is not the case
executables in the current directory will only be found if
the current directory is explicitly added to the path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you need a
portable &quot;which&quot; on the command line in an
environment that does not provide it, install App::pwhich
which provides a command line interface to this
<small>API.</small></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Implementations</b>
<br>
File::Which searches the directories of the user&rsquo;s
&quot;PATH&quot; (the current implementation uses
File::Spec#path to determine the correct &quot;PATH&quot;),
looking for executable files having the name specified as a
parameter to &quot;which&quot;. Under Win32 systems, which
do not have a notion of directly executable files, but uses
special extensions such as &quot;.exe&quot; and
&quot;.bat&quot; to identify them, &quot;File::Which&quot;
takes extra steps to assure that you will find the correct
file (so for example, you might be searching for
&quot;perl&quot;, it&rsquo;ll try <i>perl.exe</i>,
<i>perl.bat</i>, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Linux, *BSD
and other UNIXes</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There should
not be any surprises here. The current directory will not be
searched unless it is explicitly added to the path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Modern
Windows (including <small>NT, XP,</small> Vista, 7, 8, 10
etc)</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Windows
<small>NT</small> has a special environment variable called
&quot;PATHEXT&quot;, which is used by the shell to look for
executable files. Usually, it will contain a list in the
form &quot;.EXE;.BAT;.COM;.JS;.VBS&quot; etc. If
&quot;File::Which&quot; finds such an environment variable,
it parses the list and uses it as the different
extensions.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Cygwin</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Cygwin provides
a Unix-like environment for Microsoft Windows users. In most
ways it works like other Unix and Unix-like environments,
but in a few key aspects it works like Windows. As with
other Unix environments, the current directory is not
included in the search unless it is explicitly included in
the search path. Like on Windows, files with
&quot;.EXE&quot; or &lt;.BAT&gt; extensions will be
discovered even if they are not part of the query.
&quot;.COM&quot; or extensions specified using the
&quot;PATHEXT&quot; environment variable will
<small>NOT</small> be discovered without the fully qualified
name, however.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Windows
<small>ME, 98, 95,</small> MS-DOS,
<small>OS/2</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This set of
operating systems don&rsquo;t have the &quot;PATHEXT&quot;
variable, and usually you will find executable files there
with the extensions &quot;.exe&quot;, &quot;.bat&quot; and
(less likely) &quot;.com&quot;. &quot;File::Which&quot; uses
this hardcoded list if it&rsquo;s running under Win32 but
does not find a &quot;PATHEXT&quot; variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of 2015 none
of these platforms are tested frequently (or perhaps ever),
but the current maintainer is determined not to
intentionally remove support for older operating
systems.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>VMS</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Same case as
Windows 9x: uses &quot;.exe&quot; and &quot;.com&quot; (in
that order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of 2015 the
current maintainer does not test on <small>VMS,</small> and
is in fact not certain it has ever been tested on
<small>VMS.</small> If this platform is important to you and
you can help me verify and or support it on that platform
please contact me.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>which</b>
<br>
my $path = which $short_exe_name; <br>
my @paths = which $short_exe_name;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Exported by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$short_exe_name
is the name used in the shell to call the program (for
example, &quot;perl&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If it finds an
executable with the name you specified, &quot;which()&quot;
will return the absolute path leading to this executable
(for example, <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> or
<i>C:\Perl\Bin\perl.exe</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If it does
<i>not</i> find the executable, it returns
&quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;which()&quot; is called in list context, it will
return <i>all</i> the matches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>where</b>
<br>
my @paths = where $short_exe_name;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not exported by
default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Same as
&quot;which&quot; in array context. Similar to the
&quot;where&quot; csh built-in command or &quot;which
&minus;a&quot; command for platforms that support the
&quot;&minus;a&quot; option. Will return an array containing
all the path names matching $short_exe_name.</p>

<h2>GLOBALS
<a name="GLOBALS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$IMPLICIT_CURRENT_DIR</b>
<br>
True if the current directory is included in the search
implicitly on whatever platform you are using. Normally the
default is reasonable, but on Windows the current directory
is included implicitly for older shells like
&quot;cmd.exe&quot; and &quot;command.com&quot;, but not for
newer shells like PowerShell. If you overrule this default,
you should <small>ALWAYS</small> localize the variable to
the tightest scope possible, since setting this variable
from a module can affect other modules. Thus on Windows you
can get the correct result if the user is running either
&quot;cmd.exe&quot; or PowerShell on Windows you can do
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use File::Which
qw( which ); <br>
use Shell::Guess; <br>
my $path = do { <br>
my $is_power =
Shell::Guess&minus;&gt;running_shell&minus;&gt;is_power;
<br>
local $File::Which::IMPLICIT_CURRENT_DIR = !$is_power; <br>
which 'foo'; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a variety
of reasons it is difficult to accurately compute the shell
that a user is using, but Shell::Guess makes a reasonable
effort.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module has
no non-core requirements for Perl 5.6.2 and better.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This module is
fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1. It may work on 5.8.0. It
should work on Perl 5.6.x and I may even test on 5.6.2. I
will accept patches to maintain compatibility for such older
Perls, but you may need to fix it on 5.6.x / 5.8.0 and send
me a patch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not tested on
<small>VMS</small> although there is platform specific code
for those. Anyone who haves a second would be very kind to
send me a report of how it went.</p>

<h2>SUPPORT

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pwhich,
App::pwhich</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Command line interface to this
module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">IPC::Cmd</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Requires Perl 5.8.3. Included
as part of the Perl core as of 5.9.5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This module
provides (among other things) a &quot;can_run&quot;
function, which is similar to &quot;which&quot;. It is a
much heavier module since it does a lot more, and if you use
&quot;can_run&quot; it pulls in ExtUtils::MakeMaker. This
combination may be overkill for applications which do not
need IPC::Cmd&rsquo;s complicated interface for running
programs, or do not need the memory overhead required for
installing Perl modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At least some
older versions will find executables in the current
directory, even if the current directory is not in the
search path (which is the default on modern Unix).</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;can_run&quot;
converts directory path name to the 8.3 version on Windows
using &quot;Win32::GetShortPathName&quot; in some cases.
This is frequently useful for tools that just need to run
something using &quot;system&quot; in scalar mode, but may
be inconvenient for tools like App::pwhich where user
readability is a premium. Relying on
&quot;Win32::GetShortPathName&quot; to produce filenames
without spaces is problematic, as 8.3 filenames can be
turned off with tweaks to the registry (see
&lt;https://technet.microsoft.com/en&minus;us/library/cc959352.aspx&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Devel::CheckBin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Requires Perl 5.8.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This module
purports to &quot;check that a command is available&quot;,
but does not provide any documentation on how you might use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This module
also relies on ExtUtils::MakeMaker so has the same overhead
burdens as IPC::Cmd.</p>
