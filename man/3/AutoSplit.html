<h1>AutoSplit</h1>



<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AutoSplit
&minus; split a package for autoloading</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">autosplit($file,
$dir, $keep, $check, $modtime); <br>
autosplit_lib_modules(@modules);</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This function
will split up your program into files that the AutoLoader
module can handle. It is used by both the standard perl
libraries and by the MakeMaker utility, to automatically
configure libraries for autoloading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;autosplit&quot; interface splits the specified file
into a hierarchy rooted at the directory $dir. It creates
directories as needed to reflect class hierarchy, and
creates the file <i>autosplit.ix</i>. This file acts as both
forward declaration of all package routines, and as
timestamp for the last update of the hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The remaining
three arguments to &quot;autosplit&quot; govern other
options to the autosplitter. <br>
$keep</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">If the third argument,
<i>$keep</i>, is false, then any pre-existing
&quot;*.al&quot; files in the autoload directory are removed
if they are no longer part of the module (obsoleted
functions). $keep defaults to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$check</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The fourth argument,
<i>$check</i>, instructs &quot;autosplit&quot; to check the
module currently being split to ensure that it includes a
&quot;use&quot; specification for the AutoLoader module, and
skips the module if AutoLoader is not detected. $check
defaults to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$modtime</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Lastly, the <i>$modtime</i>
argument specifies that &quot;autosplit&quot; is to check
the modification time of the module against that of the
&quot;autosplit.ix&quot; file, and only split the module if
it is newer. $modtime defaults to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typical use of
AutoSplit in the perl MakeMaker utility is via the
command-line with:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl &minus;e
'use AutoSplit; autosplit($ARGV[0], $ARGV[1], 0, 1, 1)'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Defined as a
Make macro, it is invoked with file and directory arguments;
&quot;autosplit&quot; will split the specified file into the
specified directory and delete obsolete &quot;.al&quot;
files, after checking first that the module does use the
AutoLoader, and ensuring that the module is not already
currently split in its current form (the modtime test).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;autosplit_lib_modules&quot; form is used in the
building of perl. It takes as input a list of files
(modules) that are assumed to reside in a directory
<b>lib</b> relative to the current directory. Each file is
sent to the autosplitter one at a time, to be split into the
directory <b>lib/auto</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In both usages
of the autosplitter, only subroutines defined following the
perl <i>__END__</i> token are split out into separate files.
Some routines may be placed prior to this marker to force
their immediate loading and parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Multiple
packages</b> <br>
As of version 1.01 of the AutoSplit module it is possible to
have multiple packages within a single file. Both of the
following cases are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package NAME;
<br>
__END__ <br>
sub AAA { ... } <br>
package NAME::option1; <br>
sub BBB { ... } <br>
package NAME::option2; <br>
sub BBB { ... } <br>
package NAME; <br>
__END__ <br>
sub AAA { ... } <br>
sub NAME::option1::BBB { ... } <br>
sub NAME::option2::BBB { ... }</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;
will inform the user if it is necessary to create the
top-level directory specified in the invocation. It is
preferred that the script or installation process that
invokes &quot;AutoSplit&quot; have created the full
directory path ahead of time. This warning may indicate that
the module is being split into an incorrect path.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;
will warn the user of all subroutines whose name causes
potential file naming conflicts on machines with drastically
limited (8 characters or less) file name length. Since the
subroutine name is used as the file name, these warnings can
aid in portability to such systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Warnings are
issued and the file skipped if &quot;AutoSplit&quot; cannot
locate either the <i>__END__</i> marker or a &quot;package
Name;&quot;&minus;style specification.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;
will also emit general diagnostics for inability to create
directories or files.</p>

For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public
License, <br>
my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that
no Perl <br>
script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you
explicitly put <br>
said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.
Furthermore, any <br>
object code linked with perl does not automatically fall
under the <br>
terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds
definitions <br>
of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair
the <br>
resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl
script. I <br>
consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the
moral <br>
equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language
itself. You <br>
may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that
you provide <br>
or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU
General <br>
Public License. (This is merely an alternate way of
specifying input <br>
to the program.) You may also sell a binary produced by the
dumping of <br>
a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you
provide or <br>
offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.
(The <br>
fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same
binary file <br>
is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.) This is my
interpretation <br>
of the GPL. If you still have concerns or difficulties
understanding <br>
my intent, feel free to contact me. Of course, the Artistic
License <br>
spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer
to use that.</p>
