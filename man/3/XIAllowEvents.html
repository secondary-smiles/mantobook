A valid server time or CurrentTime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">touchid <br>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
XIAllowEvents request releases some queued events if the
client <br>
has caused a device to freeze. It also is used to handle
touch grab and <br>
ownership processing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
has no effect if the specified time is earlier than the
last&minus;grab <br>
time of the most recent active grab for the client, or if
the specified time is <br>
later than the current X server time. The time parameter
must be CurrentTime for <br>
requests with event modes of XIAcceptTouch and
XIRejectTouch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
describes the processing that occurs depending on what
constant <br>
you pass to the event_mode argument:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XIAsyncDevice:
<br>
If the specified device is frozen by the client, event
processing for that <br>
device continues as usual. If the device is frozen multiple
times by the <br>
client on behalf of multiple separate grabs, XIAsyncDevice
thaws for <br>
all. XIAsyncDevice has no effect if the specified device is
not frozen <br>
by the client, but the device need not be grabbed by the
client.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XISyncDevice:
<br>
If the specified device is frozen and actively grabbed by
the client, <br>
event processing for that device continues normally until
the next <br>
button press or release, or key press or release, or a
gesture begin or end <br>
event (depending on the grab) is reported to the client.
<br>
At this time, the specified device again appears to freeze.
<br>
However, if the reported event causes the grab to be
released, the <br>
specified device does not freeze. <br>
XISyncDevice has no effect if the specified device is not
frozen by the <br>
client or is not grabbed by the client.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XIReplayDevice:
<br>
If the specified device is actively grabbed by the client
and is frozen <br>
as the result of an event having been sent to the client
(either from <br>
the activation of a XIGrabButton or from a previous
XIAllowEvents with <br>
mode SyncDevice, but not from a Grab), the grab is released
and <br>
that event is completely reprocessed. This time, however,
the request <br>
ignores any passive grabs at or above (towards the root) the
<br>
grab window of the grab just released. <br>
The request has no effect if the specified device is not
grabbed by <br>
the client or if it is not frozen as the result of an event.
<br>
In case of gesture begin event being replayed, the original
grabbing <br>
client will receive a XI_GesturePinchEnd or
XI_GestureSwipeEnd event.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XIAsyncPairedDevice:
<br>
If the paired master device is frozen by the client, event
processing <br>
for it continues as usual. If the paired device is frozen
multiple <br>
times by the client on behalf of multiple separate grabs,
<br>
XIAsyncPairedDevice thaws for all. <br>
XIAsyncPairedDevice has no effect if the device is not
frozen by the <br>
client, but those devices need not be grabbed by the client.
<br>
XIAsyncPairedDevice has no effect if deviceid specifies a
slave device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XISyncPair:
<br>
If both the device and the paired master device are frozen
by the <br>
client, event processing (for both devices) continues
normally until <br>
the next XI_ButtonPress, XI_ButtonRelease, XI_KeyPress, or
XI_KeyRelease <br>
event is reported to the client for a grabbed device (button
event for <br>
a pointer, key event for a keyboard), at which time the
devices again <br>
appear to freeze. However, if the reported event causes the
grab to be <br>
released, then the devices do not freeze (but if the other
device is <br>
still grabbed, then a subsequent event for it will still
cause both <br>
devices to freeze). <br>
XISyncPair has no effect unless both the device and the
paired master <br>
device are frozen by the client. If the device or paired
master device <br>
is frozen twice by the client on behalf of two separate
grabs, <br>
XISyncPair thaws for both (but a subsequent freeze for
XISyncPair will <br>
only freeze each device once). <br>
XISyncPair has no effect if deviceid specifies a slave
device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XIAsyncPair:
<br>
If the device and the paired master device are frozen by the
client, <br>
event processing for both devices continues normally. If a
device is <br>
frozen twice by the client on behalf of two separate grabs,
AsyncBoth <br>
thaws for both. XIAsyncPair has no effect unless both the
device and the <br>
paired master device frozen by the client. <br>
XIAsyncPair has no effect if deviceid specifies a slave
device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XIAcceptTouch:
<br>
The client is deemed to have taken control of the touch
sequence once it <br>
owns the sequence. TouchEnd events will be sent to all
clients listening <br>
to the touch sequence that have either grabbed the touch
sequence on a <br>
child window of the grab_window or have received events for
the touch <br>
sequence through event selection. These clients will no
longer receive <br>
any TouchUpdate events.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">XIRejectTouch:
<br>
The client is no longer interested in the touch sequence,
and will <br>
receive a XI_TouchEnd event. If the client is the current
owner of the <br>
sequence, ownership will be passed on to the next
listener.</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadDevice <br>
An invalid deviceid was specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadAccess <br>
This error may occur if event_mode is XIAcceptTouch and this
client <br>
is not the current or potential owner of the specified touch
ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadValue <br>
This error may occur if event_mode is XIAcceptTouch and
touch ID is invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BadWindow <br>
A value for a grab_window argument does not name a defined
<br>
Window.</p>
