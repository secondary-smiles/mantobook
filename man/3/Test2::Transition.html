&minus; Transition notes when upgrading to Test2</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is where
gotchas and breakages related to the Test2 upgrade are
documented. The upgrade causes Test::Builder to defer to
Test2 under the hood. This transition is mostly transparent,
but there are a few cases that can trip you up.</p>

<h2>THINGS THAT BREAK
<a name="THINGS THAT BREAK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
list of scenarios that break with the new internals.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Test::Builder1.5/2
conditionals</b> <i><br>
The Problem</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">a few years
back there were two attempts to upgrade/replace
Test::Builder. Confusingly these were called Test::Builder2
and Test::Builder1.5, in that order. Many people put
conditionals in their code to check the Test::Builder
version number and adapt their code accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
Test::Builder2/1.5 projects both died out. Now the
conditional code people added has become a mine field. A
vast majority of modules broken by Test2 fall into this
category.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>The
Fix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fix is to
remove all Test::Builder1.5/2 related code. Either use the
legacy Test::Builder <small>API,</small> or use Test2
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Replacing
the Test::Builder singleton</b> <i><br>
The Problem</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some test
modules would replace the Test::Builder singleton instance
with their own instance or subclass. This was usually done
to intercept or modify results as they happened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
Test::Builder singleton is now a simple compatibility
wrapper around Test2. The Test::Builder singleton is no
longer the central place for results. Many results bypass
the Test::Builder singleton completely, which breaks and
behavior intended when replacing the singleton.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>The
Fix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you simply
want to intercept all results instead of letting them go to
<small>TAP,</small> you should look at the Test2::API docs
and read about pushing a new hub onto the hub stack.
Replacing the hub temporarily is now the correct way to
intercept results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your goal is
purely monitoring of events use the
&quot;Test2::Hub&minus;&gt;listen()&quot; method exported by
Test::More to watch events as they are fired. If you wish to
modify results before they go to <small>TAP</small> look at
the &quot;Test2::Hub&minus;&gt;filter()&quot; method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Directly
Accessing Hash Elements</b> <i><br>
The Problem</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some modules
look directly at hash keys on the Test::Builder singleton.
The problem here is that the Test::Builder singleton no
longer holds anything important.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>The
Fix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The fix is to
use the <small>API</small> specified in Test2::API to look
at or modify state as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Subtest
indentation</b> <i><br>
The Problem</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An early
change, in fact the change that made Test2 an idea, was a
change to the indentation of the subtest note. It was
decided it would be more readable to outdent the subtest
note instead of having it inline with the subtest:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># subtest foo
<br>
ok 1 &minus; blah <br>
1..1 <br>
ok 1 &minus; subtest foo</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The old style
indented the note:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># subtest foo
<br>
ok 1 &minus; blah <br>
1..1 <br>
ok 1 &minus; subtest foo</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This breaks
tests that do string comparison of <small>TAP</small>
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>The
Fix</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $indent =
$INC{'Test2/API.pm'} ? '' : ' '; <br>
is( <br>
$subtest_output, <br>
&quot;${indent}# subtest foo&quot;, <br>
&quot;Got subtest note&quot; <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Check if
$INC{'Test2/API.pm'} is set, if it is then no indentation
should be expected. If it is not set, then the old
Test::Builder is in use, indentation should be expected.</p>

<h2>DISTRIBUTIONS THAT BREAK OR NEED TO BE UPGRADED
<a name="DISTRIBUTIONS THAT BREAK OR NEED TO BE UPGRADED"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a list
of cpan modules that have been known to have been broken by
the upgrade at one point.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>WORKS
BUT TESTS WILL FAIL</small></b> <br>
These modules still function correctly, but their test
suites will not pass. If you already have these modules
installed then you can continue to use them. If you are
trying to install them after upgrading Test::Builder you
will need to force installation, or bypass the broken tests.
<br>
Test::DBIx::Class::Schema</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This module has a test that
appears to work around a Test::Builder bug. The bug appears
to have been fixed by Test2, which means the workaround
causes a failure. This can be easily updated, but nobody has
done so yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Known broken in
versions: 1.0.9 and older</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Device::Chip</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Tests break due to subtest
indentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Known broken in
version 0.07. Apparently works fine in 0.06 though. Patch
has been submitted to fix the issue.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>UPGRADE
SUGGESTED</small></b> <br>
These are modules that did not break, but had broken test
suites that have since been fixed. <br>
Test::Exception</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Old versions work fine, but
have a minor test name behavior that breaks with Test2. Old
versions will no longer install because of this. The latest
version on <small>CPAN</small> will install just fine.
Upgrading is not required, but is recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.43</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Data::Peek</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some tests depended on $! and
$? being modified in subtle ways. A patch was applied to
correct things that changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The module
itself works fine, there is no need to upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.45</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">circular::require</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some tests were fragile and
required base.pm to be loaded at a late stage. Test2 was
loading base.pm too early. The tests were updated to fix
this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The module
itself never broke, you do not need to upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.12</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Module::Used</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A test worked around a
now-fixed planning bug. There is no need to upgrade if you
have an old version installed. New versions install fine if
you want them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.2.5</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Moose::More</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some tests were fragile, but
have been fixed. The actual breakage was from the subtest
comment indentation change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">No need to
upgrade, old versions work fine. Only new versions will
install.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.025</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::FITesque</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This was broken by a bugfix to
how planning is done. The test was updated after the
bugfix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.04</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Kit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Old versions work fine, but
would not install because Test::Aggregate was in the
dependency chain. An upgrade should not be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 2.15</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autouse</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A test broke because it
depended on Scalar::Util not being loaded. Test2 loads
Scalar::Util. The test was updated to load Test2 after
checking Scalar::Util&rsquo;s load status.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
need to upgrade if you already have it installed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 1.11</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NEED
TO UPGRADE</small></b> <br>
Test::SharedFork</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Old versions need to directly
access Test::Builder singleton hash elements. The latest
version on <small>CPAN</small> will still do this on old
Test::Builder, but will defer to Test2::IPC on Test2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.35</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Builder::Clutch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This works by doing overriding
methods on the singleton, and directly accessing hash values
on the singleton. A new version has been released that uses
the Test2 <small>API</small> to accomplish the same result
in a saner way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.07</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Dist::VersionSync</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This had Test::Builder2
conditionals. This was fixed by removing the
conditionals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 1.1.4</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Modern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This relied on
&quot;Test::Builder&minus;&gt;_try()&quot; which was a
private method, documented as something nobody should use.
This was fixed by using a different tool.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.012</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::UseAllModules</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Version 0.14 relied on
&quot;Test::Builder&minus;&gt;history&quot; which was
available in Test::Builder 1.5. Versions 0.12 and 0.13
relied on other Test::Builder internals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.15</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::More::Prefix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Worked by applying a role that
wrapped &quot;Test::Builder&minus;&gt;_print_comment&quot;.
Fixed by adding an event filter that modifies the message
instead when running under Test2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Fixed in
version: 0.007</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>STILL
BROKEN</small></b> <br>
Test::Aggregate</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This distribution directly
accesses the hash keys in the Test::Builder singleton. It
also approaches the problem from the wrong angle, please
consider using Test2::Aggregate for similar functionality
and Test2::Harness which allows module preloading at the
harness level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Still broken as
of version: 0.373</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Wrapper</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This module directly uses hash
keys in the Test::Builder singleton. This module is also
obsolete thanks to the benefits of Test2. Use
&quot;intercept()&quot; from Test2::API to achieve a similar
result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Still broken as
of version: 0.3.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::ParallelSubtest</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This module overrides
&quot;Test::Builder::subtest()&quot; and
&quot;Test::Builder::done_testing()&quot;. It also directly
accesses hash elements of the singleton. It has not yet been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatives:
Test2::AsyncSubtest and Test2::Workflow (not stable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Still broken as
of version: 0.05</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Pretty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See
https://github.com/tokuhirom/Test&minus;Pretty/issues/25</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The author
admits the module is crazy, and he is awaiting a stable
release of something new (Test2) to completely rewrite it in
a sane way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Still broken as
of version: 0.32</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Net::BitTorrent</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The tests for this module
directly access Test::Builder hash keys. Most, if not all of
these hash keys have public <small>API</small> methods that
could be used instead to avoid the problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Still broken in
version: 0.052</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Group</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">It monkeypatches Test::Builder,
and calls it &quot;black magic&quot; in the code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Still broken as
of version: 0.20</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Flatten</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This modifies the Test::Builder
internals in many ways. A better was to accomplish the goal
of this module is to write your own subtest function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Still broken as
of version: 0.11</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">Log::Dispatch::Config::TestLog</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Modifies Test::Builder
internals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Still broken as
of version: 0.02</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::Able</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Modifies Test::Builder

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of
using $Level to perform a backtrace, Test2 uses a context
object. In this sample you create a context object and store
it. This locks the context (errors report 1 level up from
here) for all wrapped tools to find. You do not need to use
the context object, but you do need to store it in a
variable. Once the sub ends the $ctx variable is destroyed
which lets future tools find their own.</p>
