<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
written a test module based on Test::Builder then
Test::Tester allows you to test it with the minimum of
effort.</p>

<h2>HOW TO USE (THE EASY WAY)
<a name="HOW TO USE (THE EASY WAY)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From version
0.08 Test::Tester no longer requires you to included
anything special in your test modules. All you need to do
is</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
Test::Tester;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">in your test
script <b>before</b> any other Test::Builder based modules
and away you go.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other modules
based on Test::Builder can be used to help with the testing.
In fact you can even use functions from your module to test
other functions from the same module (while this is possible
it is probably not a good idea, if your module has bugs,
then using it to test itself may give the wrong
answers).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The easiest way
to test is to do something like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">check_test(
<br>
sub { is_mystyle_eq(&quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;,
&quot;not eq&quot;) }, <br>
{ <br>
ok =&gt; 0, # we expect the test to fail <br>
name =&gt; &quot;not eq&quot;, <br>
diag =&gt; &quot;Expected: 'this'\nGot: 'that'&quot;, <br>
} <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">this will
execute the is_mystyle_eq test, capturing its results and
checking that they are what was expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may need to
examine the test results in a more flexible way, for
example, the diagnostic output may be quite long or complex
or it may involve something that you cannot predict in
advance like a timestamp. In this case you can get direct
access to the test results:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my ($premature,
@results) = run_tests( <br>
sub { <br>
is_database_alive(&quot;dbname&quot;); <br>
} <br>
); <br>
like($result[0]&minus;&gt;{diag}, &quot;/^Database ping took
\\d+ seconds$&quot;/, &quot;diag&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">check_test(
<br>
sub { is_mystyle_qr(&quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;,
&quot;not matching&quot;) }, <br>
{ <br>
ok =&gt; 0, # we expect the test to fail <br>
name =&gt; &quot;not matching&quot;, <br>
diag =&gt; qr/Expected: 'this'\s+Got: 'that'/, <br>
} <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We cannot
predict how long the database ping will take so we use
Test::More&rsquo;s <b>like()</b> test to check that the
diagnostic string is of the right form.</p>

<h2>HOW TO USE (THE HARD WAY)
<a name="HOW TO USE (THE HARD WAY)"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>This is here
for backwards compatibility only</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Make your
module use the Test::Tester::Capture object instead of the
Test::Builder one. How to do this depends on your module but
assuming that your module holds the Test::Builder object in
$Test and that all your test routines access it through
$Test then providing a function something like this</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub set_builder
<br>
{ <br>
$Test = shift; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">should allow
your test scripts to do</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Test::YourModule::set_builder(Test::Tester&minus;&gt;capture);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and after that
any tests inside your module will captured.</p>

<h2>TEST RESULTS
<a name="TEST RESULTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The result of
each test is captured in a hash. These hashes are the same
as the hashes returned by Test::Builder&minus;&gt;details
but with a couple of extra fields.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These fields
are documented in Test::Builder in the <b>details()</b>
function <br>
ok</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Did the test pass?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">actual_ok</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Did the test really pass? That
is, did the pass come from
Test::Builder&minus;&gt;<b>ok()</b> or did it pass because
it was a <small>TODO</small> test?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">name</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The name supplied for the
test.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">type</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">What kind of test?
Possibilities include, skip, todo etc. See Test::Builder for
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">reason</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">The reason for the skip, todo
etc. See Test::Builder for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These fields
are exclusive to Test::Tester. <br>
diag</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">Any diagnostics that were
output for the test. This only includes diagnostics output
<b>after</b> the test result is declared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
Test::Builder ensures that any diagnostics end in a \n and
it in earlier versions of Test::Tester it was essential that
you have the final \n in your expected diagnostics. From
version 0.10 onward, Test::Tester will add the \n if you
forgot it. It will not add a \n if you are expecting no
diagnostics. See below for help tracking down hard to find
space and tab related problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">depth</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%;">This allows you to check that
your test module is setting the correct value for
$Test::Builder::Level and thus giving the correct file and
line number when a test fails. It is calculated by looking
at <b>caller()</b> and $Test::Builder::Level. It should
count how many subroutines there are before jumping into the
function you are testing. So for example in</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">run_tests( sub
{ my_test_function(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) } );</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">the depth
should be 1 and in</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">sub deeper {
my_test_function(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) } <br>
run_tests(sub { deeper() });</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">depth should be
2, that is 1 for the sub {} and one for <b>deeper()</b>.
This might seem a little complex but if your tests look like
the simple examples in this doc then you don&rsquo;t need to
worry as the depth will always be 1 and that&rsquo;s what
Test::Tester expects by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note</b>: if
you do not specify a value for depth in <b>check_test()</b>
then it automatically compares it against 1, if you really
want to skip the depth test then pass in undef.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note</b>:
depth will not be correctly calculated for tests that run
from a signal handler or an <small>END</small> block or
anywhere else that hides the call stack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some of
Test::Tester&rsquo;s functions return arrays of these
hashes, just like Test::Builder&minus;&gt;details. That is,
the hash for the first test will be array element 1 (not 0).
Element 0 will not be a hash it will be a string which
contains any diagnostic output that came before the first
test. This should usually be empty, if it&rsquo;s not, it
means something output diagnostics before any test results
showed up.</p>

<h2>SPACES AND TABS
<a name="SPACES AND TABS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Appearances can
be deceptive, especially when it comes to emptiness. If you
are scratching your head trying to work out why Test::Tester
is saying that your diagnostics are wrong when they look
perfectly right then the answer is probably whitespace. From
version 0.10 on, Test::Tester surrounds the expected and got
diag values with single quotes to make it easier to spot
trailing whitespace. So in this example</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># Got diag (5
bytes): <br>
# 'abcd ' <br>
# Expected diag (4 bytes): <br>
# 'abcd'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">it is quite
clear that there is a space at the end of the first string.
Another way to solve this problem is to use colour and
inverse video on an <small>ANSI</small> terminal, see below
<small>COLOUR</small> below if you want this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately
this is sometimes not enough, neither colour nor quotes will
help you with problems involving tabs, other non-printing
characters and certain kinds of problems inherent in
Unicode. To deal with this, you can switch Test::Tester into
a mode whereby all &quot;tricky&quot; characters are shown
as \{xx}. Tricky characters are those with
<small>ASCII</small> code less than 33 or higher than 126.
This makes the output more difficult to read but much easier
to find subtle differences between strings. To turn on this
mode either call &quot;show_space()&quot; in your test
script or set the &quot;TESTTESTERSPACE&quot; environment
variable to be a true value. The example above would then
look like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># Got diag (5
bytes): <br>
# abcd\x{20} <br>
# Expected diag (4 bytes): <br>
# abcd</p>

<h2>COLOUR
<a name="COLOUR"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you prefer
to use colour as a means of finding tricky whitespace
characters then you can set the &quot;TESTTESTCOLOUR&quot;
environment variable to a comma separated pair of colours,
the first for the foreground, the second for the background.
For example &quot;white,red&quot; will print white text on a
red background. This requires the Term::ANSIColor module.
You can specify any colour that would be acceptable to the
Term::ANSIColor::color function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you spell
colour differently, that&rsquo;s no problem. The
&quot;TESTTESTERCOLOR&quot; variable also works (if both are
set then the British spelling wins out).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\&amp;test_sub
is a reference to a subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">run_tests runs
the subroutine in $test_sub and captures the results of any
tests inside it. You can run more than 1 test inside this
subroutine if you like.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$premature is a
string containing any diagnostic output from before the
first test.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@results is an
array of test result hashes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>cmp_result(\%result,

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\%result is a
ref to a test result hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\%expect is a
ref to a hash of expected values for the test result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cmp_result
compares the result with the expected values. If any
differences are found it outputs diagnostics. You may leave
out any field from the expected result and cmp_result will
not do the comparison of that field.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>cmp_results(\@results,

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\@expects is a
ref to an array of hash refs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cmp_results
checks that the results match the expected results and if
any differences are found it outputs diagnostics. It first
checks that the number of elements in \@results and
\@expects is the same. Then it goes through each result
checking it against the expected result as in
<b>cmp_result()</b> above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>($premature,
@results) = check_tests(\&amp;test_sub, \@expects,

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\@expect is a
ref to an array of hash refs which are expected test
results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">check_tests
combines run_tests and cmp_tests into a single call. It also
checks if the tests died at any stage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It returns the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\%expect is a
ref to an hash of expected values for the test result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">check_test is a
wrapper around check_tests. It combines run_tests and
cmp_tests into a single call, checking if the test died. It
assumes that only a single test is run inside \&amp;test_sub
and include a test to make sure this is true.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It returns the
same values as run_tests, so you can further examine the

<h2>HOW IT WORKS
<a name="HOW IT WORKS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally, a
test module (let&rsquo;s call it Test:MyStyle) calls
Test::Builder&minus;&gt;new to get the Test::Builder object.
Test::MyStyle calls methods on this object to record
information about test results. When Test::Tester is loaded,
it replaces Test::Builder&rsquo;s <b>new()</b> method with
one which returns a Test::Tester::Delegate object. Most of
the time this object behaves as the real Test::Builder
object. Any methods that are called are delegated to the
real Test::Builder object so everything works perfectly.
However once we go into test mode, the method calls are no
longer passed to the real Test::Builder object, instead they
go to the Test::Tester::Capture object. This object seems
exactly like the real Test::Builder object, except, instead
of outputting test results and diagnostics, it just records
all the information for later analysis.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
calling Test::Builder&minus;&gt;note is minimal. It&rsquo;s
implemented as an empty stub, so modules that use it will
not crash but the calls are not recorded for testing
purposes like the others. Patches welcome.</p>

<h2>SEE ALSO
<a name="SEE ALSO"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Test::Builder
the source of testing goodness. Test::Builder::Tester for an
alternative approach to the problem tackled by Test::Tester
&minus; captures the strings output by Test::Builder. This
means you cannot get separate access to the individual
pieces of information and you must predict <b>exactly</b>
what your test will output.</p>
