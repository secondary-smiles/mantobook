<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">XGraphicsExposeEvent,
XNoExposeEvent &minus; GraphicsExpose and NoExpose event
structures</p>

<h2>STRUCTURES
<a name="STRUCTURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structures
for <b>GraphicsExpose</b> and <b>NoExpose</b> events
contain:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
int type; /* GraphicsExpose */ <br>
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ <br>
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ <br>
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */ <br>
Drawable drawable; <br>
int x, y; <br>
int width, height; <br>
int count; /* if nonzero, at least this many more */ <br>
int major_code; /* core is CopyArea or CopyPlane */ <br>
int minor_code; /* not defined in the core */ <br>
} XGraphicsExposeEvent;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
int type; /* NoExpose */ <br>
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ <br>
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ <br>
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */ <br>
Drawable drawable; <br>
int major_code; /* core is CopyArea or CopyPlane */ <br>
int minor_code; /* not defined in the core */ <br>
} XNoExposeEvent;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive these events, their structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> event to a client application, it
sends an <b>XGraphicsExposeEvent</b> structure with the type
member set to <b>GraphicsExpose</b>. The display member is
set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The
send_event member is set to <b>True</b> if the event came
from a <b>SendEvent</b> protocol request. The serial member
is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both structures
have these common members: drawable, major_code, and
minor_code. The drawable member is set to the drawable of
the destination region on which the graphics request was to
be performed. The major_code member is set to the graphics
request initiated by the client and can be either
<b>X_CopyArea</b> or <b>X_CopyPlane</b>. If it is
<b>X_CopyArea</b>, a call to <b>XCopyArea</b> initiated the
request. If it is <b>X_CopyPlane</b>, a call to
<b>XCopyPlane</b> initiated the request. These constants are
defined in <b>X11/Xproto.h</b>. The minor_code member, like
the major_code member, indicates which graphics request was
initiated by the client. However, the minor_code member is
not defined by the core X protocol and will be zero in these
cases, although it may be used by an extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>XGraphicsExposeEvent</b> structure has these additional
members: x, y, width, height, and count. The x and y members
are set to the coordinates relative to the drawable&rsquo;s
origin and indicate the upper-left corner of the rectangle.
The width and height members are set to the size (extent) of
the rectangle. The count member is set to the number of
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> events to follow. If count is zero, no
more <b>GraphicsExpose</b> events follow for this window.
However, if count is nonzero, at least that number of
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> events (and possibly more) are to
follow for this window.</p>
