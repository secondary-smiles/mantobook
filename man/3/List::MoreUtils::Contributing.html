List::MoreUtils</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">List::Moreutils
has a turbulent history and a strong approach. Before going
further, please step to Open Source Contribution Etiquette
&lt;http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html&gt; and
then come back.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The current
distribution is a balance between finishing the history and
claiming for future requirements. Therefore some components
will receive a rewrite on purpose &minus; others
won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the moment
&minus; it&rsquo;s not the primary goal to clean up the
configuration stage, until the primary goals and
prerequisites are done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To contribute
to List::MoreUtils, one has to arrange with the current
situation, dig into details and ask for clarifying when
parts are incomprehensible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Primary
Goals</b> <br>
The very first primary goal is to clear the backlog. These
are primarily the open issues, feature requests and missing
infrastructure elements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As example see
RT#93207 or RT#75672 for missing configure time checks,
while RT#93207 radiates until test &minus; but doesn&rsquo;t
affect runtime nor installation (beside test failures).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Secondary
Goals</b> <br>
Secondary goals are harmonizing the function names and
calling convention (see RT#102673), tidying the
infrastructure of the distribution and remove unnecessary
complexity (while protecting the necessary).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One example of
removing unnecessary infrastructure could be to move
Data::Tumbler and Test::WriteVariants into authoring mode,
when improved test for RT#93207 could be reasonably done by
a module which is recommended for test. The recommendation
of Graham Knop&rsquo;s Makefile.PL#L82
&lt;https://github.com/haarg/List-MoreUtils/blob/dd877f963deead742fc90005636c72c6be9060fc/Makefile.PL#L82&gt;
in PR#9
&lt;https://github.com/perl5-utils/List-MoreUtils/pull/9&gt;
a desirable one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Orientation
Guide</b> <br>
List::MoreUtils configuration stage heavily depends on
Config::AutoConf and Data::Tumbler. A few prerequisites of
both modules aren&rsquo;t available for Perl 5.6 &minus;
which leads to a tiny emulation layer t the begin of
&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
Config::AutoConf is quite simple &minus; the opportunities
for checking the environment cover a much wider range than a
simple test whether there is a working compiler. It requires
a lot of improvements since its base ExtUtils::CBuilder was
never designed to support that kind of solutions &minus; but
there is <i>Work In Progress</i>. To finally solve issues as
RT#75672 even in cross-compile environments &minus; there is
no way around such a checking tool.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The reason for
Data::Tumbler in combination with Test::WriteVariants are
extensible tests with reasonable effort and easy figuring
out which extra condition causes failures. Also &minus;
missing pre-conditions should result in failing tests i some
cases &minus; what is fully supported by the logic behind
Data::Tumbler in combination with Test::WriteVariants.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally &minus;
inc::latest glues the stuff in a bundle together to allow
people with older toolchains to use List::MoreUtils out of
the box (maybe with reduced quantity but full quality).</p>
