<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sd&minus;login.h
provides APIs to introspect and monitor seat, login session
and user status information on the local system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that these
APIs only allow purely passive access and monitoring of
seats, sessions and users. To actively make changes to the
seat configuration, terminate login sessions, or switch
session on a seat you need to utilize the D&minus;Bus API of
systemd&minus;logind, instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
synchronously access data in /proc/, /sys/fs/cgroup/ and
/run/. All of these are virtual file systems, hence the
runtime cost of the accesses is relatively cheap.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
(and often a very good choice) to mix calls to the
synchronous interface of sd&minus;login.h with the
asynchronous D&minus;Bus interface of systemd&minus;logind.
However, if this is done you need to think a bit about
possible races since the stream of events from D&minus;Bus
and from sd&minus;login.h interfaces such as the login
monitor are asynchronous and not ordered against each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
functions return string arrays, these are generally
<b>NULL</b> terminated and need to be freed by the caller
with the libc <b>free</b>(3) call after use, including the
strings referenced therein. Similarly, individual strings
returned need to be freed, as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
exception, instead of an empty string array <b>NULL</b> may
be returned, which should be treated equivalent to an empty
string array.</p>

<h2>DEFINITION OF TERMS
<a name="DEFINITION OF TERMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">seat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A seat consists of all hardware
devices assigned to a specific workplace. It consists of at
least one graphics device, and usually also includes
keyboard, mouse. It can also include video cameras, sound
cards and more. Seats are identified by seat names, which
are strings (&lt;= 255 characters), that start with the four
characters &quot;seat&quot; followed by at least one
character from the range [a&minus;zA&minus;Z0&minus;9],
&quot;_&quot; and &quot;&minus;&quot;. They are suitable for
use as file names. Seat names may or may not be stable and
may be reused if a seat becomes available again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">session</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A session is defined by the
time a user is logged in until they log out. A session is
bound to one or no seats (the latter for 'virtual' ssh
logins). Multiple sessions can be attached to the same seat,
but only one of them can be active, the others are in the
background. A session is identified by a short string.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd</b>(1)
ensures that audit sessions are identical to systemd
sessions, and uses the audit session ID as session ID in
systemd (if auditing is enabled). In general the session
identifier is a short string consisting only of
[a&minus;zA&minus;Z0&minus;9], &quot;_&quot; and
&quot;&minus;&quot;, suitable for use as a file name.
Session IDs are unique on the local machine and are never
reused as long as the machine is online. A user (the way we
know it on UNIX) corresponds to the person using a computer.
A single user can have multiple sessions open at the same
time. A user is identified by a numeric user id (UID) or a
user name (a string). A multi&minus;session system allows
multiple user sessions on the same seat at the same time. A
multi&minus;seat system allows multiple independent seats
that can be individually and simultaneously used by
different users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All hardware
devices that are eligible to being assigned to a seat, are
assigned to one. A device can be assigned to only one seat
at a time. If a device is not assigned to any particular
other seat it is implicitly assigned to the special default
seat called &quot;seat0&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
hardware like printers, hard disks or network cards is
generally not assigned to a specific seat. They are
available to all seats equally. (Well, with one exception:
USB sticks can be assigned to a seat.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;seat0&quot;
always exists.</p>

<h2>UDEV RULES
<a name="UDEV RULES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assignment of
hardware devices to seats is managed inside the udev
database, via settings on the devices:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tag
&quot;seat&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When set, a device is eligible
to be assigned to a seat. This tag is set for graphics
devices, mice, keyboards, video cards, sound cards and more.
Note that some devices like sound cards consist of multiple
subdevices (i.e. a PCM for input and another one for
output). This tag will be set only for the originating
device, not for the individual subdevices. A UI for
configuring assignment of devices to seats should enumerate
and subscribe to all devices with this tag set and show them
in the UI. Note that USB hubs can be assigned to a seat as
well, in which case all (current and future) devices plugged
into it will also be assigned to the same seat (unless they
are explicitly assigned to another seat).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tag
&quot;master&minus;of&minus;seat&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When set, this device is enough
for a seat to be considered existent. This tag is usually
set for the framebuffer device of graphics cards. A seat
hence consists of an arbitrary number of devices marked with
the &quot;seat&quot; tag, but (at least) one of these
devices needs to be tagged with
&quot;master&minus;of&minus;seat&quot; before the seat is
actually considered to be around.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Property
<i>ID_SEAT</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This property specifies the
name of the seat a specific device is assigned to. If not
set the device is assigned to &quot;seat0&quot;. Also, to
speed up enumeration of hardware belonging to a specific
seat, the seat is also set as tag on the device. I.e. if the
property <i>ID_SEAT=seat&minus;waldo</i> is set for a
device, the tag &quot;seat&minus;waldo&quot; will be set as
well. Note that if a device is assigned to
&quot;seat0&quot;, it will usually not carry such a tag and
you need to enumerate all devices and check the
<i>ID_SEAT</i> property manually. Again, if a device is
assigned to seat0 this is visible on the device in two ways:
with a property <i>ID_SEAT=seat0</i> and with no property
<i>ID_SEAT</i> set for it at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Property
<i>ID_AUTOSEAT</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When set to &quot;1&quot;, this
device automatically generates a new and independent seat,
which is named after the path of the device. This is set for
specialized USB hubs like the Pluggable devices, which when
plugged in should create a hotplug seat without further
configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Property
<i>ID_FOR_SEAT</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When creating additional
(manual) seats starting from a graphics device this is a
good choice to name the seat after. It is created from the
path of the device. This is useful in UIs for configuring
seats: as soon as you create a new seat from a graphics
device, read this property and prefix it with
&quot;seat&minus;&quot; and use it as name for the seat.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A seat exists
only and exclusively because a properly tagged device with
the right <i>ID_SEAT</i> property exists. Besides udev rules
there is no persistent data about seats stored on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>systemd-logind</b>(8) manages ACLs on a number of device
classes, to allow user code to access the device nodes
attached to a seat as long as the user has an active session
on it. This is mostly transparent to applications. As
mentioned above, for certain user software it might be a
good idea to watch whether they can access device nodes
instead of thinking about seats.</p>

<h2>NOTES

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These APIs are
implemented as a shared library, which can be compiled and
