<h2>CREATING A CLASS
<a name="CREATING A CLASS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As most people
who are writing modules know, you start a package with a
package declaration and some indication of module
version:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
DateTime::Format::ICal; our $VERSION = '0.04';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After that, you
call Builder with some options. There are only a few
(detailed later). Right now, we&rsquo;re only interested in
<i>parsers</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
DateTime::Format::Builder ( parsers =&gt; {...} );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>parsers</i> option takes a reference to a hash of method
names and specifications:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">parsers =&gt; {
<br>
parse_datetime =&gt; ... , <br>
parse_datetime_with_timezone =&gt; ... , <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Builder will
create methods in your class, each method being a parser
that follows the given specifications. It is <b>strongly</b>
recommended that one method is called <i>parse_datetime</i>,
be it a Builder created method or one of your own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
creating any of the parser methods it also creates a
&quot;new&quot; method that can instantiate (or clone)
objects of this class. This behaviour can be modified with
the <i>constructor</i> option, but we don&rsquo;t need to
know that yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each value
corresponding to a method name in the parsers list is either
a single specification, or a list of specifications.
We&rsquo;ll start with the simple case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">parse_briefdate
=&gt; { params =&gt; [qw( year month day )], regex =&gt;
<br>
qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/, },</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will
result in a method named <i>parse_briefdate</i> which will
take strings in the form 20040716 and return DateTime
objects representing that date. A user of the class might
write:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
DateTime::Format::ICal; <br>
my $date = '19790716'; <br>
my $dt =
DateTime::Format::ICal&minus;&gt;parse_briefdate($date);
<br>
print &quot;My birth month is &quot;,
$dt&minus;&gt;month_name, &quot;\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;regex&quot; is applied to the input string, and if it
matches, then $1, $2, ... are mapped to the <i>params</i>
given and handed to &quot;DateTime&minus;&gt;new&quot;.
Essentially:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $rv =
DateTime&minus;&gt;new( year =&gt; $1, month =&gt; $2, day
=&gt; $3 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are more
complicated things one can do within a single specification,
but we&rsquo;ll cover those later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Often,
you&rsquo;ll want a method to be able to take one string,
and run it against multiple parser specifications. It would
be very irritating if the user had to work out what format
the datetime string was in and then which method was most
appropriate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, Builder
lets you specify multiple specifications:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">parse_datetime
=&gt; [ <br>
{ <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute second )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/,
<br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
],</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s an
arrayref of specifications. A parser will be created that
will try each of these specifications sequentially, in the
order you specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s a
flaw with this though. In this example, we&rsquo;re building
a parser for ICal datetimes. One can place a timezone id at
the start of an ICal datetime. You might extract such an id
with the following code:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if ( $date =~
s/^TZID=([^:]+):// ) { <br>
$time_zone = $1; <br>
} <br>
# Z at end means UTC <br>
elsif ( $date =~ s/Z$// ) { <br>
$time_zone = 'UTC'; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
$time_zone = 'floating'; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$date would end
up without the id, and $time_zone would contain something
appropriate to give to DateTime&rsquo;s <i>set_time_zone</i>
method, or <i>time_zone</i> argument.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But how to get
this scrap of code into your parser? You might be tempted to
call the parser something else and build a small wrapper.
There&rsquo;s no need though because an option is provided
for preprocessing dates:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">parse_datetime
=&gt; [ <br>
[ preprocess =&gt; \&amp;_parse_tz ], # Only changed line!
<br>
{ <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute second )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/,
<br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
],</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It will
necessitate <i>_parse_tz</i> to be written, and that routine
looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub _parse_tz {
<br>
my %args = @_; <br>
my ( $date, $p ) = @args{qw( input parsed )}; <br>
if ( $date =~ s/^TZID=([^:]+):// ) { <br>
$p&minus;&gt;{time_zone} = $1; <br>
} <br>
# Z at end means UTC <br>
elsif ( $date =~ s/Z$// ) { <br>
$p&minus;&gt;{time_zone} = 'UTC'; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
$p&minus;&gt;{time_zone} = 'floating'; <br>
} <br>
return $date; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On input it is
given a hash containing two items: the input date and a
hashref that will be used in the parsing. The return value
from the routine is what the parser specifications will run
against, and anything in the <i>parsed</i> hash ($p in the
example) will be put in the call to
&quot;DateTime&minus;&gt;new(...)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, we now have
a happily working ICal parser. It parses the assorted
formats, and can also handle timezones. Is there anything
else it needs to do? No. But we can make it work more
efficiently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At present, the
specifications are tested sequentially. However, each one
applies to strings of particular lengths. Thus we could be
efficient and have the parser only test the given strings
against a parser that handles that string length. Again,
Builder makes it easy:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">parse_datetime
=&gt; [ <br>
[ preprocess =&gt; \&amp;_parse_tz ], <br>
{ <br>
length =&gt; 15, # We handle strings of exactly 15 chars
<br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute second )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/,
<br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
length =&gt; 13, # exactly 13 chars... <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
length =&gt; 11, # 11.. <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
length =&gt; 8, # yes. <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
],</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now the created
parser will create a parser that only runs specifications
against appropriate strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So our complete
code looks like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
DateTime::Format::ICal; <br>
use strict; <br>
our $VERSION = '0.04'; <br>
use DateTime::Format::Builder ( <br>
parsers =&gt; { <br>
parse_datetime =&gt; [ <br>
[ preprocess =&gt; \&amp;_parse_tz ], <br>
{ <br>
length =&gt; 15, <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute second )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/,
<br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
length =&gt; 13, <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
length =&gt; 11, <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)T(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
{ <br>
length =&gt; 8, <br>
params =&gt; [qw( year month day )], <br>
regex =&gt; qr/^(\d\d\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/, <br>
}, <br>
], <br>
}, <br>
); <br>
sub _parse_tz { <br>
my %args = @_; <br>
my ( $date, $p ) = @args{qw( input parsed )}; <br>
if ( $date =~ s/^TZID=([^:]+):// ) { <br>
$p&minus;&gt;{time_zone} = $1; <br>
} <br>
# Z at end means UTC <br>
elsif ( $date =~ s/Z$// ) { <br>
$p&minus;&gt;{time_zone} = 'UTC'; <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
$p&minus;&gt;{time_zone} = 'floating'; <br>
} <br>
return $date; <br>
} <br>
1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And
that&rsquo;s an ICal parser. The actual
DateTime::Format::ICal module also includes formatting
methods and parsing for durations, but Builder doesn&rsquo;t
support those yet. A drop in replacement (at the time of
writing the replacement) can be found in the <i>examples</i>
directory of the Builder distribution, along with similar
variants of other common modules.</p>
