<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
functionality provided by the servername callback is mostly
superseded by the ClientHello callback, which can be set
using <b>SSL_CTX_set_client_hello_cb()</b>. However, even
where the ClientHello callback is used, the servername
callback is still necessary in order to acknowledge the
servername requested by the client.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback()</b>
sets the application callback <b>cb</b> used by a server to
perform any actions or configuration required based on the
servername extension received in the incoming connection.
When <b>cb</b> is <small>NULL, SNI</small> is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The servername
callback should return one of the following values:
<small><br>
SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is used to indicate that
the servername requested by the client has been accepted.
Typically a server will call <b>SSL_set_SSL_CTX()</b> in the
callback to set up a different configuration for the
selected servername in this case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In this case the servername
requested by the client is not accepted and the handshake
will be aborted. The value of the alert to be used should be
stored in the location pointed to by the <b>al</b> parameter
to the callback. By default this value is initialised to
<small>SSL_AD_UNRECOGNIZED_NAME.</small></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_WARNING</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this value is returned then
the servername is not accepted by the server. However, the
handshake will continue and send a warning alert instead.
The value of the alert should be stored in the location
pointed to by the <b>al</b> parameter as for
<small>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL</small> above. Note that
TLSv1.3 does not support warning alerts, so if TLSv1.3 has
been negotiated then this return value is treated the same
way as <small>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK.</small></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This return value indicates
that the servername is not accepted by the server. No alerts
are sent and the server will not acknowledge the requested
servername.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg()</b>
sets a context-specific argument to be passed into the
callback (via the <b>arg</b> parameter) for this
<b><small>SSL_CTX</small></b> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The behaviour
of <b>SSL_get_servername()</b> depends on a number of
different factors. In particular note that in TLSv1.3 the
servername is negotiated in every handshake. In TLSv1.2 the
servername is only negotiated on initial handshakes and not
on resumption handshakes. <br>
On the client, before the handshake</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a servername has been set
via a call to <b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> then it will
return that servername.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If one has not
been set, but a TLSv1.2 resumption is being attempted and
the session from the original handshake had a servername
accepted by the server then it will return that
servername.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise it
returns <small>NULL.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">On the client, during or after
the handshake and a TLSv1.2 (or below) <br>
resumption occurred</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the session from the
original handshake had a servername accepted by the server
then it will return that servername.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise it
returns the servername set via
<b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> or <small>NULL</small> if
it was not called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">On the client, during or after
the handshake and a TLSv1.2 (or below) <br>
resumption did not occur</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">It will return the servername
set via <b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> or
<small>NULL</small> if it was not called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">On the server, before the
handshake</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The function will always return
<small>NULL</small> before the handshake</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">On the server, after the
servername extension has been processed and a <br>
TLSv1.2 (or below) resumption occurred</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a servername was accepted by
the server in the original handshake then it will return
that servername, or <small>NULL</small> otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">On the server, after the
servername extension has been processed and a <br>
TLSv1.2 (or below) resumption did not occur</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The function will return the
servername requested by the client in this handshake or
<small>NULL</small> if none was requested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
ClientHello callback occurs before a servername extension
from the client is processed. The servername, certificate
and <small>ALPN</small> callbacks occur after a servername
extension from the client is processed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_get_servername_type()</b>
returns the servername type or &minus;1 if no servername is
present. Currently the only supported type (defined in
<small>RFC3546</small> ) is
<b>TLSEXT_NAMETYPE_host_name</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b>
sets the server name indication ClientHello extension to
contain the value <b>name</b>. The type of server name
indication extension is set to
<b>TLSEXT_NAMETYPE_host_name</b> (defined in
<small>RFC3546</small> ).</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several
callbacks are executed during ClientHello processing,
including the ClientHello, <small>ALPN,</small> and
servername callbacks. The ClientHello callback is executed
first, then the servername callback, followed by the
<small>ALPN</small> callback.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> function should only be
called on <small>SSL</small> objects that will act as
clients; otherwise the configured <b>name</b> will be
ignored.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUES
<a name="RETURN VALUES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback()</b>
and <b>SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg()</b> both always
return 1 indicating success.
<b>SSL_set_tlsext_host_name()</b> returns 1 on success, 0 in
case of error.</p>

<h2>HISTORY
<a name="HISTORY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_get_servername()</b>
historically provided some unexpected results in certain
corner cases. This has been fixed from OpenSSL 1.1.1e.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to
1.1.1e, when the client requested a servername in an initial
TLSv1.2 handshake, the server accepted it, and then the
client successfully resumed but set a different explicit
servername in the second handshake then when called by the
client it returned the servername from the second handshake.
This has now been changed to return the servername requested
in the original handshake.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also prior to
1.1.1e, if the client sent a servername in the first
handshake but the server did not accept it, and then a
second handshake occurred where TLSv1.2 resumption was
successful then when called by the server it returned the
servername requested in the original handshake. This has now
been changed to <small>NULL.</small></p>
