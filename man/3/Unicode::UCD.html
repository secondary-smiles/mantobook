<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
Unicode::UCD module offers a series of functions that
provide a simple interface to the Unicode Character
Database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>code point
argument</b> <br>
Some of the functions are called with a <i>code point
argument</i>, which is either a decimal or a hexadecimal
scalar designating a code point in the platform&rsquo;s
native character set (extended to Unicode), or a string
containing &quot;U+&quot; followed by hexadecimals
designating a Unicode code point. A leading 0 will force a
hexadecimal interpretation, as will a hexadecimal digit that
isn&rsquo;t a decimal digit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">223 # Decimal
223 in native character set <br>
0223 # Hexadecimal 223, native (= 547 decimal) <br>
0xDF # Hexadecimal DF, native (= 223 decimal) <br>
'0xDF' # String form of hexadecimal (= 223 decimal) <br>
'U+DF' # Hexadecimal DF, in Unicode's character set <br>
(= LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
largest code point in Unicode is U+10FFFF.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>charinfo()</b>
<br>
use Unicode::UCD 'charinfo'; <br>
my $charinfo = charinfo(0x41);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This returns
information about the input &quot;code point argument&quot;
as a reference to a hash of fields as defined by the Unicode
standard. If the &quot;code point argument&quot; is not
assigned in the standard (i.e., has the general category
&quot;Cn&quot; meaning &quot;Unassigned&quot;) or is a
non-character (meaning it is guaranteed to never be assigned
in the standard), &quot;undef&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fields that
aren&rsquo;t applicable to the particular code point
argument exist in the returned hash, and are empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For results
that are less &quot;raw&quot; than this function returns, or
to get the values for any property, not just the few covered
by this function, use the &quot;<b>charprop()</b>&quot;
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The keys in the
hash with the meanings of their values are: <b><br>
code</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">the input native &quot;code
point argument&quot; expressed in hexadecimal, with leading
zeros added if necessary to make it contain at least four
hexdigits</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>name</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">name of <i>code</i>, all
<small>IN UPPER CASE.</small> Some control-type code points
do not have names. This field will be empty for
&quot;Surrogate&quot; and &quot;Private Use&quot; code
points, and for the others without a name, it will contain a
description enclosed in angle brackets, like
&quot;&lt;control&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>category</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The short name of the general
category of <i>code</i>. This will match one of the keys in
the hash returned by
&quot;<b>general_categories()</b>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; function can be used
to get all the synonyms of the category name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>combining</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">the combining class number for
<i>code</i> used in the Canonical Ordering Algorithm. For
Unicode 5.1, this is described in Section 3.11
&quot;Canonical Ordering Behavior&quot; available at
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; function can be used
to get all the synonyms of the combining class number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bidi</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">bidirectional type of
<i>code</i>. This will match one of the keys in the hash
returned by &quot;<b>bidi_types()</b>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; function can be used
to get all the synonyms of the bidi type name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>decomposition</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is empty if <i>code</i> has no
decomposition; or is one or more codes (separated by spaces)
that, taken in order, represent a decomposition for
<i>code</i>. Each has at least four hexdigits. The codes may
be preceded by a word enclosed in angle brackets, then a
space, like &quot;&lt;compat&gt; &quot;, giving the type of
decomposition</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This
decomposition may be an intermediate one whose components
are also decomposable. Use Unicode::Normalize to get the
final decomposition in one step.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>decimal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">if <i>code</i> represents a
decimal digit this is its integer numeric value</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>digit</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">if <i>code</i> represents some
other digit-like number, this is its integer numeric
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>numeric</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">if <i>code</i> represents a
whole or rational number, this is its numeric value.
Rational values are expressed as a string like
&quot;1/4&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>mirrored</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;Y&quot; or &quot;N&quot;
designating if <i>code</i> is mirrored in bidirectional
text</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>unicode10</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">name of <i>code</i> in the
Unicode 1.0 standard if one existed for this code point and
is different from the current name</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>comment</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As of Unicode 6.0, this is
always empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>upper</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is, if non-empty, the uppercase
mapping for <i>code</i> expressed as at least four
hexdigits. This indicates that the full uppercase mapping is
a single character, and is identical to the simple
(single-character only) mapping. When this field is empty,
it means that the simple uppercase mapping is <i>code</i>
itself; you&rsquo;ll need some other means, (like
&quot;<b>charprop()</b>&quot; or
&quot;<b>casespec()</b>&quot; to get the full mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>lower</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is, if non-empty, the lowercase
mapping for <i>code</i> expressed as at least four
hexdigits. This indicates that the full lowercase mapping is
a single character, and is identical to the simple
(single-character only) mapping. When this field is empty,
it means that the simple lowercase mapping is <i>code</i>
itself; you&rsquo;ll need some other means, (like
&quot;<b>charprop()</b>&quot; or
&quot;<b>casespec()</b>&quot; to get the full mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>title</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is, if non-empty, the titlecase
mapping for <i>code</i> expressed as at least four
hexdigits. This indicates that the full titlecase mapping is
a single character, and is identical to the simple
(single-character only) mapping. When this field is empty,
it means that the simple titlecase mapping is <i>code</i>
itself; you&rsquo;ll need some other means, (like
&quot;<b>charprop()</b>&quot; or
&quot;<b>casespec()</b>&quot; to get the full mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>block</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">the block <i>code</i> belongs
to (used in &quot;\p{Blk=...}&quot;). The
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; function can be used
to get all the synonyms of the block name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Blocks versus Scripts&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>script</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">the script <i>code</i> belongs
to. The &quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; function can
be used to get all the synonyms of the script name. Note
that this is the older &quot;Script&quot; property value,
and not the improved &quot;Script_Extensions&quot;
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Blocks versus Scripts&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
cannot do (de)composition and casing based solely on the
<i>decomposition</i>, <i>combining</i>, <i>lower</i>,
<i>upper</i>, and <i>title</i> fields; you will need also
the &quot;<b>casespec()</b>&quot; function and the
&quot;Composition_Exclusion&quot; property. (Or you could
just use the <b>lc()</b>, <b>uc()</b>, and <b>ucfirst()</b>
functions, and the Unicode::Normalize module.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>charprop()</b>
<br>
use Unicode::UCD 'charprop'; <br>
print charprop(0x41, &quot;Gc&quot;), &quot;\n&quot;; <br>
print charprop(0x61, &quot;General_Category&quot;),
&quot;\n&quot;; <br>
prints <br>
Lu <br>
Ll</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This returns
the value of the Unicode property given by the second
parameter for the &quot;code point argument&quot; given by
the first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The passed-in
property may be specified as any of the synonyms returned by
&quot;<b>prop_aliases()</b>&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The return
value is always a scalar, either a string or a number. For
properties where there are synonyms for the values, the
synonym returned by this function is the longest, most
descriptive form, the one returned by
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; when called in a
scalar context. Of course, you can call
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; on the result to get
other synonyms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The return
values are more &quot;cooked&quot; than the
&quot;<b>charinfo()</b>&quot; ones. For example, the
&quot;uc&quot; property value is the actual string
containing the full uppercase mapping of the input code
point. You have to go to extra trouble with
&quot;charinfo&quot; to get this value from its
&quot;upper&quot; hash element when the full mapping differs
from the simple one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Special note
should be made of the return values for a few properties:
<br>
Block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The value returned is the
new-style (see &quot;Old-style versus new-style block
names&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Decomposition_Mapping</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like
&quot;<b>charinfo()</b>&quot;, the result may be an
intermediate decomposition whose components are also
decomposable. Use Unicode::Normalize to get the final
decomposition in one step.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike
&quot;<b>charinfo()</b>&quot;, this does not include the
decomposition type. Use the &quot;Decomposition_Type&quot;
property to get that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Name_Alias</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the input code point&rsquo;s
name has more than one synonym, they are returned joined
into a single comma-separated string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Numeric_Value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the result is a fraction, it
is converted into a floating point number to the accuracy of
your platform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Script_Extensions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the result is multiple
script names, they are returned joined into a single
comma-separated string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When called
with a property that is a Perl extension that isn&rsquo;t
expressible in a compound form, this function currently
returns &quot;undef&quot;, as the only two possible values
are <i>true</i> or <i>false</i> (1 or 0 I suppose). This
behavior may change in the future, so don&rsquo;t write code
that relies on it. &quot;Present_In&quot; is a Perl
extension that is expressible in a bipartite or compound
form (for example, &quot;\p{Present_In=4.0}&quot;), so
&quot;charprop&quot; accepts it. But &quot;Any&quot; is a
Perl extension that isn&rsquo;t expressible that way, so
&quot;charprop&quot; returns &quot;undef&quot; for it. Also
&quot;charprop&quot; returns &quot;undef&quot; for all Perl
extensions that are internal-only.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>charprops_all()</b>
<br>
use Unicode::UCD 'charprops_all'; <br>
my $%properties_of_A_hash_ref =
charprops_all(&quot;U+41&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This returns a
reference to a hash whose keys are all the distinct Unicode
(no Perl extension) properties, and whose values are the
respective values for those properties for the input
&quot;code point argument&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each key is the
property name in its longest, most descriptive form. The
values are what &quot;<b>charprop()</b>&quot; would
return.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This function
is expensive in time and memory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>charblock()</b>
<br>
use Unicode::UCD 'charblock'; <br>
my $charblock = charblock(0x41); <br>
my $charblock = charblock(1234); <br>
my $charblock = charblock(0x263a); <br>
my $charblock = charblock(&quot;U+263a&quot;); <br>
my $range = charblock('Armenian');</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With a
&quot;code point argument&quot; &quot;charblock()&quot;
returns the <i>block</i> the code point belongs to, e.g.
&quot;Basic Latin&quot;. The old-style block name is
returned (see &quot;Old-style versus new-style block
names&quot;). The &quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot;
function can be used to get all the synonyms of the block
name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the code
point is unassigned, this returns the block it would belong
to if it were assigned. (If the Unicode version being used
is so early as to not have blocks, all code points are
considered to be in &quot;No_Block&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also
&quot;Blocks versus Scripts&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If supplied
with an argument that can&rsquo;t be a code point,
&quot;charblock()&quot; tries to do the opposite and
interpret the argument as an old-style block name. On an
<small>ASCII</small> platform, the return value is a
<i>range set</i> with one range: an anonymous array with a
single element that consists of another anonymous array
whose first element is the first code point in the block,
and whose second element is the final code point in the
block. On an <small>EBCDIC</small> platform, the first two
Unicode blocks are not contiguous. Their range sets are
lists containing <i>start-of-range</i>, <i>end-of-range</i>
code point pairs. You can test whether a code point is in a
range set using the &quot;<b>charinrange()</b>&quot;
function. (To be precise, each <i>range set</i> contains a
third array element, after the range boundary ones: the
old_style block name.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the argument
to &quot;charblock()&quot; is not a known block,
&quot;undef&quot; is returned.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>charscript()</b>
<br>
use Unicode::UCD 'charscript'; <br>
my $charscript = charscript(0x41); <br>
my $charscript = charscript(1234); <br>
my $charscript = charscript(&quot;U+263a&quot;); <br>
my $range = charscript('Thai');</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With a
&quot;code point argument&quot;, &quot;charscript()&quot;
returns the <i>script</i> the code point belongs to, e.g.,
&quot;Latin&quot;, &quot;Greek&quot;, &quot;Han&quot;. If
the code point is unassigned or the Unicode version being
used is so early that it doesn&rsquo;t have scripts, this
function returns &quot;Unknown&quot;. The
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; function can be used
to get all the synonyms of the script name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
Script_Extensions property is an improved version of the
Script property, and you should probably be using that
instead, with the &quot;<b>charprop()</b>&quot;
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If supplied
with an argument that can&rsquo;t be a code point,
<b>charscript()</b> tries to do the opposite and interpret
the argument as a script name. The return value is a
<i>range set</i>: an anonymous array of arrays that contain
<i>start-of-range</i>, <i>end-of-range</i> code point pairs.
You can test whether a code point is in a range set using
the &quot;<b>charinrange()</b>&quot; function. (To be
precise, each <i>range set</i> contains a third array
element, after the range boundary ones: the script
name.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;charscript()&quot; argument is not a known script,
&quot;undef&quot; is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also
&quot;Blocks versus Scripts&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>charblocks()</b>
<br>
use Unicode::UCD 'charblocks'; <br>
my $charblocks = charblocks();</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;charblocks()&quot;
returns a reference to a hash with the known block names as
the keys, and the code point ranges (see
&quot;<b>charblock()</b>&quot;) as the values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The names are
in the old-style (see &quot;Old-style versus new-style block
names&quot;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prop_invmap(&quot;block&quot;)
can be used to get this same data in a different type of
data structure.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prop_values(&quot;Block&quot;)
can be used to get all the known new-style block names as a
list, without the code point ranges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also
&quot;Blocks versus Scripts&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>charscripts()</b>
<br>
use Unicode::UCD 'charscripts'; <br>
my $charscripts = charscripts();</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;charscripts()&quot;
returns a reference to a hash with the known script names as
the keys, and the code point ranges (see
&quot;<b>charscript()</b>&quot;) as the values.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prop_invmap(&quot;script&quot;)
can be used to get this same data in a different type of
data structure. Since the Script_Extensions property is an
improved version of the Script property, you should instead
use prop_invmap(&quot;scx&quot;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;prop_values(&quot;Script&quot;)&quot;
can be used to get all the known script names as a list,

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>charinrange()</b>
<br>
In addition to using the &quot;\p{Blk=...}&quot; and
&quot;\P{Blk=...}&quot; constructs, you can also test
whether a code point is in the <i>range</i> as returned by
&quot;<b>charblock()</b>&quot; and
&quot;<b>charscript()</b>&quot; or as the values of the hash
returned by &quot;<b>charblocks()</b>&quot; and
&quot;<b>charscripts()</b>&quot; by using
&quot;charinrange()&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This returns a
reference to a hash which has short general category names
(such as &quot;Lu&quot;, &quot;Nd&quot;, &quot;Zs&quot;,
&quot;S&quot;) as keys and long names (such as
&quot;UppercaseLetter&quot;, &quot;DecimalNumber&quot;,
&quot;SpaceSeparator&quot;, &quot;Symbol&quot;) as values.
The hash is reversible in case you need to go from the long
names to the short names. The general category is the one
returned from &quot;<b>charinfo()</b>&quot; under the
&quot;category&quot; key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;<b>prop_values()</b>&quot; and
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; functions can be
used as an alternative to this function; the first returning

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A

is returned if it has one, or &quot;undef&quot; otherwise.
If the optional scalar ref is passed, it would be set to 1
if the return is valid; or 0 if the return is
&quot;undef&quot;. Note that the numeric value returned need
not be a whole number. &quot;num(&quot;\N{TIBETAN DIGIT HALF
ZERO}&quot;)&quot;, for example returns &minus;0.5.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the string
is more than one character, &quot;undef&quot; is returned
unless all its characters are decimal digits (that is, they
would match &quot;\d+&quot;), from the same script. For
example if you have an <small>ASCII</small> &rsquo;0&rsquo;
and a Bengali &rsquo;3&rsquo;, mixed together, they
aren&rsquo;t considered a valid number, and
&quot;undef&quot; is returned. A further restriction is that
the digits all have to be of the same form. A half-width
digit mixed with a full-width one will return
&quot;undef&quot;. The Arabic script has two sets of digits;
&quot;num&quot; will return &quot;undef&quot; unless all the
digits in the string come from the same set. In all cases,
the optional scalar ref parameter is set to how long any
valid initial substring of digits is; hence it will be set
to the entire string length if the main return value is not
&quot;undef&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;num&quot;
errs on the side of safety, and there may be valid strings
of decimal digits that it doesn&rsquo;t recognize. Note that
Unicode defines a number of &quot;digit&quot; characters
that aren&rsquo;t &quot;decimal digit&quot; characters.
&quot;Decimal digits&quot; have the property that they have
a positional value, i.e., there is a units position, a
10&rsquo;s position, a 100&rsquo;s, etc, <small>AND</small>
they are arranged in Unicode in blocks of 10 contiguous code
points. The Chinese digits, for example, are not in such a
contiguous block, and so Unicode doesn&rsquo;t view them as
decimal digits, but merely digits, and so &quot;\d&quot;
will not match them. A single-character string containing
one of these digits will have its decimal value returned by
&quot;num&quot;, but any longer string containing only these
digits will return &quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Strings of
multiple sub&minus; and superscripts are not recognized as
numbers. You can use either of the compatibility
decompositions in Unicode::Normalize to change these into

synonyms are in the remaining elements, in no particular

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The input

space, hyphens, and underscores are ignored (except for the
trailing underscore in the old_form grandfathered-in

and both of which mean &quot;General_Category=Cased
Letter&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the name is
unknown, &quot;undef&quot; is returned (or an empty list in

names in regular expressions with an optional

prefixed to them, such as &quot;\p{isgc=punct}&quot;. This
function does not recognize those in the input, returning

possible synonyms.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;prop_aliases&quot;
does know about the Perl extensions to Unicode properties,

single form equivalents to Unicode properties such as
&quot;XDigit&quot;, &quot;Greek&quot;, &quot;In_Greek&quot;,
and &quot;Is_Greek&quot;. The final example demonstrates
that the &quot;Is_&quot; prefix is recognized for these
extensions; it is needed to resolve ambiguities. For
example, &quot;prop_aliases('lc')&quot; returns the list
&quot;(lc, Lowercase_Mapping)&quot;, but
&quot;prop_aliases('islc')&quot; returns &quot;(Is_LC,
Cased_Letter)&quot;. This is because &quot;islc&quot; is a
Perl extension which is short for
&quot;General_Category=Cased Letter&quot;. The lists
returned for the Perl extensions will not include the
&quot;Is_&quot; prefix (whether or not the input had it)
unless needed to resolve ambiguities, as shown in the
&quot;islc&quot; example, where the returned list had one
element containing &quot;Is_&quot;, and the other
without.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible for the reverse to happen:
&quot;prop_aliases('isc')&quot; returns the list &quot;(isc,
ISO_Comment)&quot;; whereas &quot;prop_aliases('c')&quot;
returns &quot;(C, Other)&quot; (the latter being a Perl
extension meaning &quot;General_Category=Other&quot;.
&quot;Properties accessible through Unicode::UCD&quot; in
perluniprops lists the available forms, including which ones

&quot;Is_LC&quot; and should not be used in new code, are
examples of this. These both return &quot;(Is_LC,
Cased_Letter)&quot;. Thus this function allows you to take a
discouraged form, and find its acceptable alternatives. The
same goes with single-form Block property equivalences. Only
the forms that begin with &quot;In_&quot; are not
discouraged; if you pass &quot;prop_aliases&quot; a
discouraged form, you will get back the equivalent ones that

well as all the possible forms for them (including with the
optional &quot;Is_&quot; prefixes). (Except this function
doesn&rsquo;t accept any Perl-internal properties, some of
which are listed there.) This function uses the same loose
or tighter matching rules for resolving the input
property&rsquo;s name as is done for regular expressions.
These are also specified in perluniprops. Examples of using
the &quot;property=value&quot; form are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">say join

prints: <br>
48, 58, 65, 71, 97, 103</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inversion lists
are a compact way of specifying Unicode property-value
definitions. The 0th item in the list is the lowest code
point that has the property-value. The next item (item [1])
is the lowest code point beyond that one that does
<small>NOT</small> have the property-value. And the next
item beyond that ([2]) is the lowest code point beyond that
one that does have the property-value, and so on. Put
another way, each element in the list gives the beginning of
a range that has the property-value (for even numbered
elements), or doesn&rsquo;t have the property-value (for odd
numbered elements). The name for this data structure stems
from the fact that each element in the list toggles (or
inverts) whether the corresponding range is or isn&rsquo;t
on the list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the final
example above, the first <small>ASCII</small> Hex digit is
code point 48, the character &quot;0&quot;, and all code
points from it through 57 (a &quot;9&quot;) are
<small>ASCII</small> hex digits. Code points 58 through 64
aren&rsquo;t, but 65 (an &quot;A&quot;) through 70 (an
&quot;F&quot;) are, as are 97 (&quot;a&quot;) through 102
(&quot;f&quot;). 103 starts a range of code points that
aren&rsquo;t <small>ASCII</small> hex digits. That range
extends to infinity, which on your computer can be found in
the variable $Unicode::UCD::MAX_CP. (This variable is as
close to infinity as Perl can get on your platform, and may
be too high for some operations to work; you may wish to use
a smaller number for your purposes.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
inversion lists returned by this function can possibly
include non-Unicode code points, that is anything above
0x10FFFF. Unicode properties are not defined on such code
points. You might wish to change the output to not include
these. Simply add 0x110000 at the end of the non-empty
returned list if it isn&rsquo;t already that value; and pop
that value if it is; like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my @list =
prop_invlist(&quot;foo&quot;); <br>
if (@list) { <br>
if ($list[&minus;1] == 0x110000) { <br>
pop @list; # Defeat the turning on for above Unicode <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
push @list, 0x110000; # Turn off for above Unicode <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is a simple
matter to expand out an inversion list to a full list of all
code points that have the property-value:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my @invlist =
prop_invlist($property_name); <br>
die &quot;empty&quot; unless @invlist; <br>
my @full_list; <br>

my $upper = ($i + 1) &lt; @invlist <br>

: $Unicode::UCD::MAX_CP; # To infinity. <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;prop_invmap&quot;
is used to get the complete mapping definition for a
property, in the form of an inversion map. An inversion map
consists of two parallel arrays. One is an ordered list of
code points that mark range beginnings, and the other gives
the value (or mapping) that all code points in the
corresponding range have.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;prop_invmap&quot;
is called with the name of the desired property. The name is
loosely matched, meaning that differences in case,
white-space, hyphens, and underscores are not meaningful
(except for the trailing underscore in the old-form
grandfathered-in property &quot;L_&quot;, which is better
written as &quot;LC&quot;, or even better,
&quot;Gc=LC&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many Unicode
properties have more than one name (or alias).
&quot;prop_invmap&quot; understands all of these, including
Perl extensions to them. Ambiguities are resolved as
described above for &quot;<b>prop_aliases()</b>&quot;
(except if a property has both a complete mapping, and a
binary &quot;Y&quot;/&quot;N&quot; mapping, then specifying
the property name prefixed by &quot;is&quot; causes the
binary one to be returned). The Perl internal property
&quot;Perl_Decimal_Digit, described below, is also accepted.
An empty list is returned if the property name is unknown.
See &quot;Properties accessible through Unicode::UCD&quot;
in perluniprops for the properties acceptable as inputs to
this function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is a fatal
error to call this function except in list context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the two arrays that form the inversion map,
&quot;prop_invmap&quot; returns two other values; one is a
scalar that gives some details as to the format of the
entries of the map array; the other is a default value,
useful in maps whose format name begins with the letter
&quot;a&quot;, as described below in its subsection; and for
specialized purposes, such as converting to another data
structure, described at the end of this main section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
&quot;prop_invmap&quot; returns a 4 element list. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first line
(with Index [0]) means that the value for code point 0 is
&quot;Basic Latin&quot;. The entry &quot;0x0080&quot; in the
@blocks_ranges column in the second line means that the
value from the first line, &quot;Basic Latin&quot;, extends
to all code points in the range from 0 up to but not
including 0x0080, that is, through 127. In other words, the
code points from 0 to 127 are all in the &quot;Basic
Latin&quot; block. Similarly, all code points in the range
from 0x0080 up to (but not including) 0x0100 are in the
block named &quot;Latin&minus;1 Supplement&quot;, etc.
(Notice that the return is the old-style block names; see
&quot;Old-style versus new-style block names&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The final line
(with Index [242]) means that the value for all code points
above the legal Unicode maximum code point have the value
&quot;No_Block&quot;, which is the term Unicode uses for a
non-existing block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The arrays
completely specify the mappings for all possible code
points. The final element in an inversion map returned by
this function will always be for the range that consists of
all the code points that aren&rsquo;t legal Unicode, but
that are expressible on the platform. (That is, it starts
with code point 0x110000, the first code point above the
legal Unicode maximum, and extends to infinity.) The value
for that range will be the same that any typical unassigned
code point has for the specified property. (Certain
unassigned code points are not &quot;typical&quot;; for
example the non-character code points, or those in blocks
that are to be written right-to-left. The above-Unicode
range&rsquo;s value is not based on these atypical code
points.) It could be argued that, instead of treating these
as unassigned Unicode code points, the value for this range
should be &quot;undef&quot;. If you wish, you can change the
returned arrays accordingly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The maps for
almost all properties are simple scalars that should be
interpreted as-is. These values are those given in the
Unicode-supplied data files, which may be inconsistent as to
capitalization and as to which synonym for a property-value
is given. The results may be normalized by using the
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
exceptions to the simple scalar maps. Some properties have
some elements in their map list that are themselves lists of
scalars; and some special strings are returned that are not
to be interpreted as-is. Element [2] (placed into $format in
the example above) of the returned four element list tells
you if the map has any of these special elements or not, as
follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><b>&quot;s&quot;</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>means all the elements of the map array are simple
scalars, with no special elements. Almost all properties are
like this, like the &quot;block&quot; example above.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&quot;sl&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">means that some of the map
array elements have the form given by &quot;s&quot;, and the
rest are lists of scalars. For example, here is a portion of
the output of calling &quot;prop_invmap&quot;() with the
&quot;Script Extensions&quot; property:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here, the code
points 0x964 and 0x965 are both used in Bengali, Devanagari,
Gurmukhi, and Oriya, but no other scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The Name_Alias
property is also of this form. But each scalar consists of
two components: 1) the name, and 2) the type of alias this
is. They are separated by a colon and a space. In Unicode
6.1, there are several alias types: <br>
&quot;correction&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">indicates that the name is a
corrected form for the original name (which remains valid)
for the same code point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;control&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">adds a new name for a control
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;alternate&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;figment&quot;</p>

has been documented but was never in any actual
standard.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;abbreviation&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">is a common abbreviation for a
character</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The lists are
ordered (roughly) so the most preferred names come before
less preferred ones.</p>

code point 97 is 65; or &quot;uc(&quot;a&quot;)&quot; ==
&quot;A&quot;. But the line is for the entire range of code
points 97 through 122. To get the mapping for any code point
in this range, you take the offset it has from the beginning
code point of the range, and add that to the mapping for
that first code point. So, the mapping for 122
(&quot;z&quot;) is derived by taking the offset of 122 from
97 (=25) and adding that to 65, yielding 90 (&quot;Z&quot;).
Likewise for everything in between.</p>

to $default, &quot;0&quot;, behave somewhat differently. For
these, each code point maps to itself. So, in the first line
in the example, &quot;ord(uc(chr(0)))&quot; is 0,
&quot;ord(uc(chr(1)))&quot; is 1, ..
&quot;ord(uc(chr(96)))&quot; is 96.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&quot;al&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">means that some of the map
array elements have the form given by &quot;a&quot;, and the
rest are ordered lists of code points. For example, in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">my
($uppers_ranges_ref, $uppers_maps_ref, $format, $default)
<br>
= prop_invmap(&quot;Uppercase_Mapping&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">the returned

0x014A 0 <br>
0x014B 330 <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
full Uppercase_Mapping property (as opposed to the
Simple_Uppercase_Mapping given in the example for format
&quot;a&quot;). The only difference between the two in the
ranges shown is that the code point at 0x0149 ( <small>LATIN
SMALL LETTER N PRECEDED BY APOSTROPHE</small> ) maps to a
string of two characters, 0x02BC ( <small>MODIFIER LETTER
APOSTROPHE</small> ) followed by 0x004E ( <small>LATIN
CAPITAL LETTER N</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">No adjustments
are needed to entries that are references to arrays; each
such entry will have exactly one element in its range, so
the offset is always 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The fourth

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&quot;ae&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is like &quot;a&quot;, but
some elements are the empty string, and should not be
adjusted. The one internal Perl property accessible by
&quot;prop_invmap&quot; is of this type:
&quot;Perl_Decimal_Digit&quot; returns an inversion map
which gives the numeric values that are represented by the
Unicode decimal digit characters. Characters that
don&rsquo;t represent decimal digits map to the empty
string, like so:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">@digits @values
<br>
0x0000 &quot;&quot; <br>
0x0030 0 <br>

0x07C0: 0 <br>
0x07CA: &quot;&quot; <br>
0x0966: 0 <br>
...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
the code points from 0 to 0x2F do not represent decimal
digits; the code point 0x30 ( <small>DIGIT ZERO</small> )
represents 0; code point 0x31, ( <small>DIGIT ONE</small> ),
represents 0+1&minus;0 = 1; ... code point 0x39, (
<small>DIGIT NINE</small> ), represents 0+9&minus;0 = 9; ...
code points 0x3A through 0x65F do not represent decimal
digits; 0x660 (ARABIC-INDIC <small>DIGIT ZERO</small> ),
represents 0; ... 0x07C1 ( <small>NKO DIGIT ONE</small> ),
represents 0+1&minus;0 = 1 ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The fourth
(index [3]) element ($default) in the list returned for this

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&quot;ale&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is a combination of the
&quot;al&quot; type and the &quot;ae&quot; type. Some of the
map array elements have the forms given by &quot;al&quot;,
and the rest are the empty string. The property
&quot;NFKC_Casefold&quot; has this form. An example slice
is:</p>

(index [3]) element ($default) in the list returned for this
format is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&quot;ar&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">means that all the elements of
the map array are either rational numbers or the string
&quot;NaN&quot;, meaning &quot;Not a Number&quot;. A
rational number is either an integer, or two integers
separated by a solidus (&quot;/&quot;). The second integer
represents the denominator of the division implied by the
solidus, and is actually always positive, so it is
guaranteed not to be 0 and to not be signed. When the
element is a plain integer (without the solidus), it may
need to be adjusted to get the correct value by adding the
offset, just as other &quot;a&quot; properties. No
adjustment is needed for fractions, as the range is
guaranteed to have just a single element, and so the offset
is always 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
convert the returned map to entirely scalar numbers, you can
use something like this:</p>

function returns that real name, the empty string. (There
are names for these characters, but they are considered
aliases, not the Name property name, and are contained in
the &quot;Name_Alias&quot; property.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&quot;ad&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">means the Decomposition_Mapping

except that one of the scalar elements is of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;hangul
syllable&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This signifies
that this entry should be replaced by the decompositions for
all the code points whose decomposition is algorithmically
calculated. (All of them are currently in one range and no
others outside the range are likely to ever be added to
Unicode; the &quot;n&quot; format has this same entry.)
These can be generated via the function
<b>Unicode::Normalize::NFD()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
mapping is the one that is specified in the Unicode data
files, and to get the final decomposition, it may need to be
applied recursively. Unicode in fact discourages use of this
property except internally in implementations of the Unicode
Normalization Algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The fourth
(index [3]) element ($default) in the list returned for this
format is 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
format begins with the letter &quot;a&quot; if and only the
property it is for requires adjustments by adding the
offsets in multi-element ranges. For all these properties,
an entry should be adjusted only if the map is a scalar
which is an integer. That is, it must match the regular
expression:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/ ^ &minus;?
\d+ $ /xa</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Further, the
first element in a range never needs adjustment, as the
adjustment would be just adding 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A binary search
such as that provided by
&quot;<b>search_invlist()</b>&quot;, can be used to quickly
find a code point in the inversion list, and hence its
corresponding mapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The final,
fourth element (index [3], assigned to $default in the
&quot;block&quot; example) in the four element list returned
by this function is used with the &quot;a&quot; format
types; it may also be useful for applications that wish to
convert the returned inversion map data structure into some
other, such as a hash. It gives the mapping that most code
points map to under the property. If you establish the
convention that any code point not explicitly listed in your
data structure maps to this value, you can potentially make
your data structure much smaller. As you construct your data
structure from the one returned by this function, simply
ignore those ranges that map to this value. For example, to
convert to the data structure searchable by
&quot;<b>charinrange()</b>&quot;, you can follow this recipe
for properties that don&rsquo;t require adjustments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my ($list_ref,
$map_ref, $format, $default) = prop_invmap($property); <br>
my @range_list; <br>
# Look at each element in the list, but the &minus;2 is
needed because we <br>
# look at $i+1 in the loop, and the final element is
guaranteed to map <br>
# to $default by prop_invmap(), so we would skip it anyway.
<br>
for my $i (0 .. @$list_ref &minus; 2) { <br>
next if $map_ref&minus;&gt;[$i] eq $default; <br>
push @range_list, [ $list_ref&minus;&gt;[$i], <br>
$list_ref&minus;&gt;[$i+1], <br>
$map_ref&minus;&gt;[$i] <br>
]; <br>
} <br>
print charinrange(\@range_list, $code_point),
&quot;\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With this,
&quot;charinrange()&quot; will return &quot;undef&quot; if
its input code point maps to $default. You can avoid this by
omitting the &quot;next&quot; statement, and adding a line
after the loop to handle the final element of the inversion
map.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, this
recipe can be used for properties that do require
adjustments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for my $i (0 ..
@$list_ref &minus; 2) { <br>
next if $map_ref&minus;&gt;[$i] eq $default; <br>

# range has just one element, so no need to worry about
adjustments. <br>
if (ref $map_ref&minus;&gt;[$i]) { <br>
push @range_list, <br>
[ $list_ref&minus;&gt;[$i], $list_ref&minus;&gt;[$i],
$map_ref&minus;&gt;[$i] ]; <br>
} <br>
else { # Otherwise each element is actually mapped to a
separate <br>
# value, so the range has to be split into single code point
<br>
# ranges. <br>
my $adjustment = 0; <br>
# For each code point that gets mapped to something... <br>
for my $j ($list_ref&minus;&gt;[$i] ..
$list_ref&minus;&gt;[$i+1] &minus;1 ) { <br>
# ... add a range consisting of just it mapping to the <br>
# original plus the adjustment, which is incremented for the
<br>
# next time through the loop, as the offset increases by 1
<br>
# for each element in the range <br>
push @range_list, <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The returned
values for the Perl extension properties, such as
&quot;Any&quot; and &quot;Greek&quot; are somewhat
misleading. The values are either &quot;Y&quot; or

bipartite, so you can actually use the &quot;Y&quot; or
&quot;&quot;N&quot;&quot; in a Perl regular expression for
these, like &quot;qr/\p{ID_Start=Y/}&quot; or
&quot;qr/\p{Upper=N/}&quot;. But the Perl extensions
aren&rsquo;t specified this way, only like
&quot;/qr/\p{Any}&quot;, <i>etc</i>. You can&rsquo;t
actually use the &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;&quot;N&quot;&quot;

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As explained in

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Blocks
versus Scripts</b> <br>
The difference between a block and a script is that scripts
are closer to the linguistic notion of a set of code points
required to represent languages, while block is more of an
artifact of the Unicode code point numbering and separation
into blocks of consecutive code points (so far the size of a
block is some multiple of 16, like 128 or 256).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example the
Latin <b>script</b> is spread over several <b>blocks</b>,
such as &quot;Basic Latin&quot;, &quot;Latin 1
Supplement&quot;, &quot;Latin Extended&minus;A&quot;, and
&quot;Latin Extended&minus;B&quot;. On the other hand, the
Latin script does not contain all the characters of the
&quot;Basic Latin&quot; block (also known as
<small>ASCII</small> ): it includes only the letters, and
not, for example, the digits nor the punctuation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For blocks see
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Blocks.txt&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For scripts see
<small>UTR</small> #24:
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr24/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Matching
Scripts and Blocks</b> <br>
Scripts are matched with the regular-expression construct
&quot;\p{...}&quot; (e.g. &quot;\p{Tibetan}&quot; matches
characters of the Tibetan script), while
&quot;\p{Blk=...}&quot; is used for blocks (e.g.
&quot;\p{Blk=Tibetan}&quot; matches any of the 256 code
points in the Tibetan block).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Old-style
versus new-style block names</b> <br>
Unicode publishes the names of blocks in two different
styles, though the two are equivalent under Unicode&rsquo;s
loose matching rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The original
style uses blanks and hyphens in the block names (except for
&quot;No_Block&quot;), like so:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous
Mathematical Symbols&minus;B</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The newer style
replaces these with underscores, like this:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Miscellaneous_Mathematical_Symbols_B</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This newer
style is consistent with the values of other Unicode
properties. To preserve backward compatibility, all the
functions in Unicode::UCD that return block names (except as
noted) return the old-style ones.
&quot;<b>prop_value_aliases()</b>&quot; returns the
new-style and can be used to convert from old-style to
new-style:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $new_style =
prop_values_aliases(&quot;block&quot;, $old_style);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl also has
single-form extensions that refer to blocks,
&quot;In_Cyrillic&quot;, meaning &quot;Block=Cyrillic&quot;.
These have always been written in the new style.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To convert from
new-style to old-style, follow this recipe:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$old_style =
charblock((prop_invlist(&quot;block=$new_style&quot;))[0]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(which finds
the range of code points in the block using
&quot;prop_invlist&quot;, gets the lower end of the range
(0th element) and then looks up the old name for its block
using &quot;charblock&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
starting in Unicode 6.1, many of the block names have
shorter synonyms. These are always given in the new
style.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Use with
older Unicode versions</b> <br>
The functions in this module work as well as can be expected
when used on earlier Unicode versions. But, obviously, they
use the available data from that Unicode version. For
example, if the Unicode version predates the definition of
the script property (Unicode 3.1), then any function that
deals with scripts is going to return &quot;undef&quot; for
the script portion of the return value.</p>
