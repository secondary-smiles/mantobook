<h2>STRUCTURES
<a name="STRUCTURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The structure
for <b>CreateNotify</b> events contains:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
int type; /* CreateNotify */ <br>
unsigned long serial; /* # of last request processed by
server */ <br>
Bool send_event; /* true if this came from a SendEvent
request */ <br>
Display *display; /* Display the event was read from */ <br>
Window parent; /* parent of the window */ <br>
Window window; /* window id of window created */ <br>
int x, y; /* window location */ <br>
int width, height; /* size of window */ <br>
int border_width; /* border width */ <br>
Bool override_redirect; /* creation should be overridden */
<br>
} XCreateWindowEvent;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
receive this event, the structure members are set as
follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The type member
is set to the event type constant name that uniquely
identifies it. For example, when the X server reports a
<b>GraphicsExpose</b> event to a client application, it
sends an <b>XGraphicsExposeEvent</b> structure with the type
member set to <b>GraphicsExpose</b>. The display member is
set to a pointer to the display the event was read on. The
send_event member is set to <b>True</b> if the event came
from a <b>SendEvent</b> protocol request. The serial member
is set from the serial number reported in the protocol but
expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full
32-bit value. The window member is set to the window that is
most useful to toolkit dispatchers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The parent
member is set to the created window&rsquo;s parent. The
window member specifies the created window. The x and y
members are set to the created window&rsquo;s coordinates
relative to the parent window&rsquo;s origin and indicate
the position of the upper-left outside corner of the created
window. The width and height members are set to the inside
size of the created window (not including the border) and
are always nonzero. The border_width member is set to the
width of the created window&rsquo;s border, in pixels. The
override_redirect member is set to the override-redirect
attribute of the window. Window manager clients normally
should ignore this window if the override_redirect member is
<b>True</b>.</p>
