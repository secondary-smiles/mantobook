<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man is a
module to convert documentation in the <small>POD</small>
format (the preferred language for documenting Perl) into
*roff input using the man macro set. The resulting *roff
code is suitable for display on a terminal using
<b>nroff</b>(1), normally via <b>man</b>(1), or printing
using <b>troff</b>(1). It is conventionally invoked using
the driver script <b>pod2man</b>, but it can also be used
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a derived
class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Man supports the same methods
and interfaces. See Pod::Simple for all the details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>new()</b>
can take options, in the form of key/value pairs that
control the behavior of the parser. See below for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no options
are given, Pod::Man uses the name of the input file with any
trailing &quot;.pod&quot;, &quot;.pm&quot;, or
&quot;.pl&quot; stripped as the man page title, to section 1
unless the file ended in &quot;.pm&quot; in which case it
defaults to section 3, to a centered title of &quot;User
Contributed Perl Documentation&quot;, to a centered footer
of the Perl version it is run with, and to a left-hand
footer of the modification date of its input (or the current
date if given &quot;STDIN&quot; for input).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man
assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font
named &quot;CW&quot;. If yours is called something else
(like &quot;CR&quot;), use the &quot;fixed&quot; option to
specify it. This generally only matters for troff output for
printing. Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold,
italic, and bold italic fixed-width output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Besides the
obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man also takes care of
formatting <b>func()</b>, <b>func</b>(3), and simple
variable references like $foo or @bar so you don&rsquo;t
have to use code escapes for them; complex expressions like
$fred{'stuff'} will still need to be escaped, though. It
also translates dashes that aren&rsquo;t used as hyphens
into en dashes, makes long dashes--like this--into proper em
dashes, fixes &quot;paired quotes,&quot; makes C
<small>++</small> look right, puts a little space between
double underscores, makes <small>ALLCAPS</small> a teeny bit
smaller in <b>troff</b>, and escapes stuff that *roff treats
as special so that you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The recognized
options to <b>new()</b> are as follows. All options take a
single argument. <br>
center</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the centered page header
for the &quot;.TH&quot; macro. The default, if this option
is not specified, is &quot;User Contributed Perl
Documentation&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">date</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the left-hand footer for
the &quot;.TH&quot; macro. If this option is not set, the
contents of the environment variable
<small>POD_MAN_DATE,</small> if set, will be used. Failing
that, the value of <small>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH,</small> the
modification date of the input file, or the current time if
<b>stat()</b> can&rsquo;t find that file (which will be the
case if the input is from &quot;STDIN&quot;) will be used.
If obtained from the file modification date or the current
time, the date will be formatted as
&quot;YYYY&minus;MM&minus;DD&quot; and will be based on
<small>UTC</small> (so that the output will be reproducible
regardless of local time zone).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">errors</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">How to report errors.
&quot;die&quot; says to throw an exception on any
<small>POD</small> formatting error. &quot;stderr&quot; says
to report errors on standard error, but not to throw an
exception. &quot;pod&quot; says to include a <small>POD
ERRORS</small> section in the resulting documentation
summarizing the errors. &quot;none&quot; ignores
<small>POD</small> errors entirely, as much as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
&quot;pod&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fixed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The fixed-width font to use for
verbatim text and code. Defaults to &quot;CW&quot;. Some
systems may want &quot;CR&quot; instead. Only matters for
<b>troff</b> output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fixedbold</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bold version of the fixed-width
font. Defaults to &quot;CB&quot;. Only matters for
<b>troff</b> output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fixeditalic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Italic version of the
fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer, since
most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique version, not an
italic version). Defaults to &quot;CI&quot;. Only matters
for <b>troff</b> output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fixedbolditalic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bold italic (probably actually
oblique) version of the fixed-width font. Pod::Man
doesn&rsquo;t assume you have this, and defaults to
&quot;CB&quot;. Some systems (such as Solaris) have this
font available as &quot;CX&quot;. Only matters for
<b>troff</b> output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lquote <br>
rquote</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the quote marks used to
surround C&lt;&gt; text. &quot;lquote&quot; sets the left
quote mark and &quot;rquote&quot; sets the right quote mark.
Either may also be set to the special value
&quot;none&quot;, in which case no quote mark is added on
that side of C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed
for troff output).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also see the
&quot;quotes&quot; option, which can be used to set both
quotes at once. If both &quot;quotes&quot; and one of the
other options is set, &quot;lquote&quot; or
&quot;rquote&quot; overrides &quot;quotes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the name of the manual page
for the &quot;.TH&quot; macro. Without this option, the
manual name is set to the uppercased base name of the file
being converted unless the manual section is 3, in which
case the path is parsed to see if it is a Perl module path.
If it is, a path like &quot;.../lib/Pod/Man.pm&quot; is
converted into a name like &quot;Pod::Man&quot;. This
option, if given, overrides any automatic determination of
the name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If generating a
manual page from standard input, the name will be set to
&quot;STDIN&quot; if this option is not provided. Providing
this option is strongly recommended to set a meaningful
manual page name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">nourls</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Normally, L&lt;&gt; formatting
codes with a <small>URL</small> but anchor text are
formatted to show both the anchor text and the
<small>URL.</small> In other words:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">L&lt;foo|http://example.com/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">is formatted
as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">foo
&lt;http://example.com/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option, if
set to a true value, suppresses the <small>URL</small> when
anchor text is given, so this example would be formatted as
just &quot;foo&quot;. This can produce less cluttered output
in cases where the URLs are not particularly important.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">quotes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the quote marks used to
surround C&lt;&gt; text. If the value is a single character,
it is used as both the left and right quote. Otherwise, it
is split in half, and the first half of the string is used
as the left quote and the second is used as the right
quote.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This may also
be set to the special value &quot;none&quot;, in which case
no quote marks are added around C&lt;&gt; text (but the font
is still changed for troff output).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also see the
&quot;lquote&quot; and &quot;rquote&quot; options, which can
be used to set the left and right quotes independently. If
both &quot;quotes&quot; and one of the other options is set,
&quot;lquote&quot; or &quot;rquote&quot; overrides
&quot;quotes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">release</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the centered footer for the
&quot;.TH&quot; macro. By default, this is set to the
version of Perl you run Pod::Man under. Setting this to the
empty string will cause some *roff implementations to use
the system default value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that some
system &quot;an&quot; macro sets assume that the centered
footer will be a modification date and will prepend
something like &quot;Last modified: &quot;. If this is the
case for your target system, you may want to set
&quot;release&quot; to the last modified date and
&quot;date&quot; to the version number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">section</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the section for the
&quot;.TH&quot; macro. The standard section numbering
convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system
calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6
for games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for
administrator commands. There is a lot of variation here,
however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats,
5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices. Still
others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both. About the
only section numbers that are reliably consistent are 1, 2,
and 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
section 1 will be used unless the file ends in
&quot;.pm&quot; in which case section 3 will be
selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stderr</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Send error messages about
invalid <small>POD</small> to standard error instead of
appending a <small>POD ERRORS</small> section to the
generated *roff output. This is equivalent to setting
&quot;errors&quot; to &quot;stderr&quot; if
&quot;errors&quot; is not already set. It is supported for
backward compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">utf8</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, Pod::Man produces
the most conservative possible *roff output to try to ensure
that it will work with as many different *roff
implementations as possible. Many *roff implementations
cannot handle non-ASCII characters, so this means all
non-ASCII characters are converted either to a *roff escape
sequence that tries to create a properly accented character
(at least for troff output) or to &quot;X&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If this option
is set, Pod::Man will instead output
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small> If your *roff implementation can
handle it, this is the best output format to use and avoids
corruption of documents containing non-ASCII characters.
However, be warned that *roff source with literal
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> characters is not supported by
many implementations and may even result in segfaults and
other bad behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Be aware that,
when using this option, the input encoding of your
<small>POD</small> source should be properly declared unless
it&rsquo;s US-ASCII. Pod::Simple will attempt to guess the
encoding and may be successful if it&rsquo;s Latin&minus;1
or <small>UTF&minus;8,</small> but it will produce warnings.
Use the &quot;=encoding&quot; command to declare the
encoding. See <b>perlpod</b>(1) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
Pod::Simple method <b>parse_file()</b> takes one argument
naming the <small>POD</small> file to read from. By default,
the output is sent to &quot;STDOUT&quot;, but this can be
changed with the <b>output_fh()</b> method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
Pod::Simple method <b>parse_from_file()</b> takes up to two
arguments, the first being the input file to read
<small>POD</small> from and the second being the file to
write the formatted output to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
call <b>parse_lines()</b> to parse an array of lines or
<b>parse_string_document()</b> to parse a document already
in memory. As with <b>parse_file()</b>, <b>parse_lines()</b>
and <b>parse_string_document()</b> default to sending their
output to &quot;STDOUT&quot; unless changed with the
<b>output_fh()</b> method. Be aware that
<b>parse_lines()</b> and <b>parse_string_document()</b> both
expect raw bytes, not decoded characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To put the
output from any parse method into a string instead of a file
handle, call the <b>output_string()</b> method instead of
<b>output_fh()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See Pod::Simple
for more specific details on the methods available to all
derived parsers.</p>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">roff font
should be 1 or 2 chars, not &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified a *roff font
(using &quot;fixed&quot;, &quot;fixedbold&quot;, etc.) that
wasn&rsquo;t either one or two characters. Pod::Man
doesn&rsquo;t support *roff fonts longer than two
characters, although some *roff extensions do (the canonical
versions of <b>nroff</b> and <b>troff</b> don&rsquo;t
either).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid errors setting
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;errors&quot;
parameter to the constructor was set to an unknown
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid quote specification
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The quote specification
given (the &quot;quotes&quot; option to the constructor) was
invalid. A quote specification must be either one character
long or an even number (greater than one) characters
long.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>POD</small> document had
syntax errors</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The <small>POD</small>
document being formatted had syntax errors and the
&quot;errors&quot; option was set to &quot;die&quot;.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>PERL_CORE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If set and Encode is not
available, silently fall back to non&minus;UTF&minus;8 mode
without complaining to standard error. This environment
variable is set during Perl core builds, which build Encode
after podlators. Encode is expected to not (yet) be
available in that case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>POD_MAN_DATE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If set, this will be used as
the value of the left-hand footer unless the
&quot;date&quot; option is explicitly set, overriding the
timestamp of the input file or the current time. This is
primarily useful to ensure reproducible builds of the same
output file given the same source and Pod::Man version, even
when file timestamps may not be consistent.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If set, and
<small>POD_MAN_DATE</small> and the &quot;date&quot; options
are not set, this will be used as the modification time of
the source file, overriding the timestamp of the input file
or the current time. It should be set to the desired time in
seconds since <small>UNIX</small> epoch. This is primarily
useful to ensure reproducible builds of the same output file
given the same source and Pod::Man version, even when file
timestamps may not be consistent. See
&lt;https://reproducible&minus;builds.org/specs/source&minus;date&minus;epoch/&gt;
for the full specification.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(Arguably,
according to the specification, this variable should be used
only if the timestamp of the input file is not available and
Pod::Man uses the current time. However, for reproducible
builds in Debian, results were more reliable if this
variable overrode the timestamp of the input file.)</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Encoding
handling assumes that PerlIO is available and does not work
properly if it isn&rsquo;t. The &quot;utf8&quot; option is
therefore not supported unless Perl is built with PerlIO
support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is
currently no way to turn off the guesswork that tries to
format unmarked text appropriately, and sometimes it
isn&rsquo;t wanted (particularly when using
<small>POD</small> to document something other than Perl).
Most of the work toward fixing this has now been done,
however, and all that&rsquo;s still needed is a user
interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>NAME</small> section should be recognized specially
and index entries emitted for everything in that section.
This would have to be deferred until the next section, since
extraneous things in <small>NAME</small> tends to confuse
various man page processors. Currently, no index entries are
emitted for anything in <small>NAME.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man
doesn&rsquo;t handle font names longer than two characters.
Neither do most <b>troff</b> implementations, but
<small>GNU</small> troff does as an extension. It would be
nice to support as an option for those who want to use
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The preamble
added to each output file is rather verbose, and most of it
is only necessary in the presence of non-ASCII characters.
It would ideally be nice if all of those definitions were
only output if needed, perhaps on the fly as the characters
are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man is
excessively slow.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If Pod::Man is
given the &quot;utf8&quot; option, the encoding of its
output file handle will be forced to
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> if possible, overriding any
existing encoding. This will be done even if the file handle
is not created by Pod::Man and was passed in from outside.
This maintains consistency regardless of
<small>PERL_UNICODE</small> and other settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The handling of
hyphens and em dashes is somewhat fragile, and one may get
the wrong one under some circumstances. This should only
matter for <b>troff</b> output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When and
whether to use small caps is somewhat tricky, and Pod::Man
doesn&rsquo;t necessarily get it right.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Converting
neutral double quotes to properly matched double quotes
doesn&rsquo;t work unless there are no formatting codes
between the quote marks. This only matters for troff
output.</p>
