<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">curl_easy_pause
- pause and unpause a connection</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#include
&lt;curl/curl.h&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CURLcode
curl_easy_pause(CURL *</b><i>handle</i><b>, int</b>
<i>bitmask</i><b>);</b></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using this
function, you can explicitly mark a running connection to
get paused, and you can unpause a connection that was
previously paused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A connection
can be paused by using this function or by letting the read
or the write callbacks return the proper magic return code
(<i>CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE</i> and
<i>CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE</i>). A write callback that returns
pause signals to the library that it could not take care of
any data at all, and that data will then be delivered again
to the callback when the transfer is unpaused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While it may
feel tempting, take care and notice that you cannot call
this function from another thread. To unpause, you may for
example call it from the progress callback
(<i>CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION(3)</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When this
function is called to unpause receiving, the write callback
might get called before this function returns to deliver
cached content. When libcurl delivers such cached data to
the write callback, it will be delivered as fast as
possible, which may overstep the boundary set in
<i>CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE(3)</i> etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>handle</b> argument identifies the transfer you want to
pause or unpause.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A paused
transfer is excluded from low speed cancels via the
<i>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT(3)</i> option and unpausing a
transfer will reset the time period required for the low
speed limit to be met.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>bitmask</b> argument is a set of bits that sets the new
state of the connection. The following bits can be used:
<br>
CURLPAUSE_RECV</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pause receiving data. There
will be no data received on this connection until this
function is called again without this bit set. Thus, the
write callback (<i>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3)</i>) will not be
called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLPAUSE_SEND</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Pause sending data. There will
be no data sent on this connection until this function is
called again without this bit set. Thus, the read callback
(<i>CURLOPT_READFUNCTION(3)</i>) will not be called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLPAUSE_ALL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Convenience define that pauses
both directions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">CURLPAUSE_CONT</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Convenience define that
unpauses both directions.</p>

<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pausing of
transfers does not work with protocols that work without
network connectivity, like FILE://. Trying to pause such a
transfer, in any direction, will cause problems in the worst
case or an error in the best case.</p>

<h2>MULTIPLEXED
<a name="MULTIPLEXED"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a
connection is used multiplexed, like for HTTP/2, and one of
the transfers over the connection is paused and the others
continue flowing, libcurl might end up buffering contents
for the paused transfer. It has to do this because it needs
to drain the socket for the other transfers and the already
announced window size for the paused transfer will allow the
server to continue sending data up to that window size
amount. By default, libcurl announces a 32 megabyte window
size, which thus can make libcurl end up buffering 32
megabyte of data for a paused stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When such a
paused stream is unpaused again, any buffered data will be
delivered first.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/* pause a
transfer in both directions */ <br>
curl_easy_pause(curl, CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE |
CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE);</p>

<h2>MEMORY USE
<a name="MEMORY USE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When pausing a
read by returning the magic return code from a write
callback, the read data is already in libcurl&rsquo;s
internal buffers so it will have to keep it in an allocated
buffer until the receiving is again unpaused using this
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
downloaded data is compressed and is asked to get
uncompressed automatically on download, libcurl will
continue to uncompress the entire downloaded chunk and it
will cache the data uncompressed. This has the side- effect
that if you download something that is compressed a lot, it
can result in a large data amount needing to be allocated to
save the data during the pause. This said, you should
probably consider not using paused receiving if you allow
libcurl to uncompress data automatically.</p>

<h2>AVAILABILITY
<a name="AVAILABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Added in
7.18.0.</p>

<h2>RETURN VALUE
<a name="RETURN VALUE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CURLE_OK (zero)
means that the option was set properly, and a non-zero
return code means something wrong occurred after the new
state was set. See the <i>libcurl-errors(3)</i> man page for
the full list with descriptions.</p>
