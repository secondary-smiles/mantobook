<h2>NAME

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">libcurl-thread
&minus; libcurl thread safety</p>

<h2>Multi-threading with libcurl
<a name="Multi-threading with libcurl"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">libcurl is
thread safe but has no internal thread synchronization. You
may have to provide your own locking should you meet any of
the thread safety exceptions below.</p>

<h2>Handles
<a name="Handles"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You must
<b>never</b> share the same handle in multiple threads. You
can pass the handles around among threads, but you must
never use a single handle from more than one thread at any
given time.</p>

<h2>Shared objects
<a name="Shared objects"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can share
certain data between multiple handles by using the share
interface but you must provide your own locking and set
<i>curl_share_setopt(3)</i> CURLSHOPT_LOCKFUNC and
CURLSHOPT_UNLOCKFUNC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that some
items are specifically documented as not thread-safe in the
share API (the connection pool and HSTS cache for
example).</p>

<h2>TLS
<a name="TLS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
accessing HTTPS or FTPS URLs in a multi-threaded manner, you
are then of course using the underlying SSL library
multi-threaded and those libs might have their own
requirements on this issue. You may need to provide one or
two functions to allow it to function properly: <br>
OpenSSL</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">OpenSSL 1.1.0+ &quot;can be
safely used in multi-threaded applications provided that
support for the underlying OS threading API is
built-in.&quot; In that case the engine is used by libcurl
in a way that is fully thread-safe.</p>

<h2>Signals
<a name="Signals"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Signals are
used for timing out name resolves (during DNS lookup) - when
built without using either the c-ares or threaded resolver
backends. When using multiple threads you should set the
<i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> option to 1L for all handles.
Everything will or might work fine except that timeouts are
not honored during the DNS lookup - which you can work
around by building libcurl with c-ares or threaded-resolver
support. c-ares is a library that provides asynchronous name
resolves. On some platforms, libcurl simply will not
function properly multi-threaded unless the
<i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> option is set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> is set to 1L, your application
needs to deal with the risk of a SIGPIPE (that at least the
OpenSSL backend can trigger). Note that setting
<i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> to 0L will not work in a threaded
situation as there will be race where libcurl risks
restoring the former signal handler while another thread
should still ignore it.</p>

<h2>Name resolving
<a name="Name resolving"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>gethostbyname</b> or <b>getaddrinfo</b> and other name
resolving system calls used by libcurl are provided by your
operating system and must be thread safe. It is important
that libcurl can find and use thread safe versions of these
and other system calls, as otherwise it cannot function
fully thread safe. Some operating systems are known to have
faulty thread implementations. We have previously received
problem reports on *BSD (at least in the past, they may be
working fine these days). Some operating systems that are
known to have solid and working thread support are Linux,
Solaris and Windows.</p>

<h2>curl_global_* functions
<a name="curl_global_* functions"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
are thread-safe since libcurl 7.84.0 if
<i>curl_version_info(3)</i> has the
<b>CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE</b> feature bit set (most
platforms).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If these
functions are not thread-safe and you are using libcurl with
multiple threads it is especially important that before use
you call <i>curl_global_init(3)</i> or
<i>curl_global_init_mem(3)</i> to explicitly initialize the
library and its dependents, rather than rely on the
&quot;lazy&quot; fail-safe initialization that takes place
the first time <i>curl_easy_init(3)</i> is called. For an
in-depth explanation refer to <i>libcurl(3)</i> section
<b>GLOBAL CONSTANTS</b>.</p>

<h2>Memory functions
<a name="Memory functions"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
functions, provided either by your operating system or your
own replacements, must be thread safe. You can use
<i>curl_global_init_mem(3)</i> to set your own replacement
memory functions.</p>

<h2>Non-safe functions
<a name="Non-safe functions"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CURLOPT_DNS_USE_GLOBAL_CACHE(3)</i>
is not thread-safe.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>curl_version_info(3)</i>
is not thread-safe before libcurl initialization.</p>
