<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; module serves mainly as a
high-level introduction to the &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;
library, for both code and documentation purposes. The code
loads the two fundamental modules for processing BibTeX
files (&quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; and
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot;), and this documentation
gives a broad overview of the whole library that isn&rsquo;t
available in the documentation for the individual modules
that comprise it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
the &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; module provides a number of
miscellaneous functions that are useful in processing BibTeX
data (especially the kind that comes from bibliographies as
defined by BibTeX 0.99, rather than generic database files).
These functions don&rsquo;t generally fit in the
object-oriented class hierarchy centred around the
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot; class, mainly because they
are specific to bibliographic data and operate on generic
strings (rather than being tied to a particular BibTeX
entry). These are also documented here, in &quot;
<small>MISCELLANEOUS FUNCTIONS&quot;</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that every
module described here begins with the
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; prefix. For brevity, I have dropped
this prefix from most class and module names in the rest of
this manual page (and in most of the other manual pages in
the library).</p>

<h2>MODULES AND CLASSES
<a name="MODULES AND CLASSES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; library includes a number of
modules, many of which provide classes. Usually, the
relationship is simple and obvious: a module provides a
class of the same name&minus;&minus;&minus;for instance, the
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot; module provides the
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot; class. There are a few
exceptions, though: most obviously, the
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; module doesn&rsquo;t provide any
classes itself, it merely loads two modules
(&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot; and
&quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot;) that do. The other
exceptions are mentioned in the descriptions below, and
discussed in detail in the documentation for the respective
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The modules are
presented roughly in order of increasing specialization: the
first three are essential for any program that processes
BibTeX data files, regardless of what kind of data they
hold. The later modules are specialized for use with
bibliographic databases, and serve both to emulate BibTeX
0.99&rsquo;s standard styles and to provide an example of
how to define a database structure through such specialized
modules. Each module is fully documented in its respective
manual page. <br>
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Loads the two fundamental
modules (&quot;Entry&quot; and &quot;File&quot;), and
provides a number of miscellaneous functions that
don&rsquo;t fit anywhere in the class hierarchy.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Provides an object-oriented
interface to BibTeX database files. In addition to the
obvious attributes of filename and filehandle, the
&quot;file&quot; abstraction manages properties such as the
database structure and options for it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Provides an object-oriented
interface to BibTeX entries, which can be parsed from
&quot;File&quot; objects, arbitrary filehandles, or strings.
Manages all the properties of a single entry: type, key,
fields, and values. Also serves as the base class for the
<i>structured entry classes</i> (described in detail in
Text::BibTeX::Structure).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Text::BibTeX::Value&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Provides an object-oriented
interface to <i>values</i> and <i>simple values</i>,
high-level constructs that can be used to represent the
strings associated with each field in an entry. Normally,
field values are returned simply as Perl strings, with
macros expanded and multiple strings &quot;pasted&quot;
together. If desired, you can instruct
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; to return
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Value&quot; objects, which give you
access to the original form of the data.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Text::BibTeX::Structure&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Provides the
&quot;Structure&quot; and &quot;StructuredEntry&quot;
classes, which serve primarily as base classes for the two
kinds of classes that define database structures. Read this
man page for a comprehensive description of the mechanism
for implementing Perl classes analogous to BibTeX
&quot;style files&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Provides the
&quot;BibStructure&quot; and &quot;BibEntry&quot; classes,
which serve two purposes: they fulfill the same role as the
standard style files of BibTeX 0.99, and they give an
example of how to write new database structures. These
ultimately derive from, respectively, the
&quot;Structure&quot; and &quot;StructuredEntry&quot;
classes provided by the &quot;Structure&quot; module.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Text::BibTeX::BibSort&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One of the &quot;BibEntry&quot;
class&rsquo;s base classes: handles the generation of sort
keys for sorting prior to output formatting.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Text::BibTeX::BibFormat&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One of the &quot;BibEntry&quot;
class&rsquo;s base classes: handles the formatting of
bibliographic data for output in a markup language such as
LaTeX.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Text::BibTeX::Name&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A class used by the
&quot;Bib&quot; structure and specific to bibliographic data
as defined by BibTeX itself: parses individual author names
into &quot;first&quot;, &quot;von&quot;, &quot;last&quot;,
and &quot;jr&quot; parts.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;Text::BibTeX::NameFormat&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Also specific to bibliographic
data: puts split-up names (as parsed by the &quot;Name&quot;
class) back together in a custom way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a first
time through the library, you&rsquo;ll probably want to
confine your reading to Text::BibTeX::File and
Text::BibTeX::Entry. The other modules will come in handy
eventually, especially if you need to emulate BibTeX in a
fairly fine grained way (e.g. parsing names, generating sort
keys). But for the simple database hacks that are the bread
and butter of the &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; library, the
&quot;File&quot; and &quot;Entry&quot; classes are the bulk
of what you&rsquo;ll need. You may also find some of the
material in this manual page useful, namely &quot;
<small>CONSTANT VALUES&quot;</small> and &quot;
<small>UTILITY FUNCTIONS&quot;</small> .</p>

<h2>EXPORTS
<a name="EXPORTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; module has a number of optional
exports, most of them constant values described in &quot;
<small>CONSTANT VALUES&quot;</small> below. The default
exports are a subset of these constant values that are used
particularly often, the &quot;entry metatypes&quot; (also
accessible via the export tag &quot;metatypes&quot;). Thus,
the following two lines are equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
Text::BibTeX; <br>
use Text::BibTeX qw(:metatypes);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some of the
various subroutines provided by the module are also
exportable. &quot;bibloop&quot;, &quot;split_list&quot;,
&quot;purify_string&quot;, and &quot;change_case&quot; are
all useful in everyday processing of BibTeX data, but
don&rsquo;t really fit anywhere in the class hierarchy. They
may be imported from &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; using the
&quot;subs&quot; export tag. &quot;check_class&quot; and
&quot;display_list&quot; are also exportable, but only by
name; they are not included in any export tag. (These two
mainly exist for use by other modules in the library.) For
instance, to use &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; and import the
entry metatype constants and the common subroutines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
Text::BibTeX qw(:metatypes :subs);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another group
of subroutines exists for direct manipulation of the macro
table maintained by the underlying C library. These
functions (see &quot;Macro table functions&quot;, below)
allow you to define, delete, and query the value of BibTeX
macros (or &quot;abbreviations&quot;). They may be imported
<i>en masse</i> using the &quot;macrosubs&quot; export
tag:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
Text::BibTeX qw(:macrosubs);</p>

<h2>CONSTANT VALUES
<a name="CONSTANT VALUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; module makes a number of constant
values available. These correspond to the values of various
enumerated types in the underlying C library,
<b>btparse</b>, and their meanings are more fully explained
in the <b>btparse</b> documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each group of
constants is optionally exportable using an export tag given
in the descriptions below. <br>
Entry metatypes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;BTE_UNKNOWN&quot;,
&quot;BTE_REGULAR&quot;, &quot;BTE_COMMENT&quot;,
&quot;BTE_PREAMBLE&quot;, &quot;BTE_MACRODEF&quot;. The
&quot;metatype&quot; method in the &quot;Entry&quot; class
always returns one of these values. The latter three
describe, respectively, &quot;comment&quot;,
&quot;preamble&quot;, and &quot;string&quot; entries;
&quot;BTE_REGULAR&quot; describes all other entry types.
&quot;BTE_UNKNOWN&quot; should never be seen (it&rsquo;s
mainly useful for C code that might have to detect
half-baked data structures). See also btparse. Export tag:
&quot;metatypes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>AST</small> node
types</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;BTAST_STRING&quot;,
&quot;BTAST_MACRO&quot;, &quot;BTAST_NUMBER&quot;. Used to
distinguish the three kinds of simple
values&minus;&minus;&minus;strings, macros, and numbers. The
&quot;SimpleValue&quot; class&rsquo; &quot;type&quot; method
always returns one of these three values. See also
Text::BibTeX::Value, btparse. Export tag:
&quot;nodetypes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Name parts</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;BTN_FIRST&quot;,
&quot;BTN_VON&quot;, &quot;BTN_LAST&quot;,
&quot;BTN_JR&quot;, &quot;BTN_NONE&quot;. Used to specify
the various parts of a name after it has been split up.
These are mainly useful when using the
&quot;NameFormat&quot; class. See also bt_split_names and
bt_format_names. Export tag: &quot;nameparts&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Join methods</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot;,
&quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot;, &quot;BTJ_FORCETIE&quot;,
&quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot;. Used to tell the
&quot;NameFormat&quot; class how to join adjacent tokens
together; see Text::BibTeX::NameFormat and bt_format_names.
Export tag: &quot;joinmethods&quot;.</p>

<h2>UTILITY FUNCTIONS
<a name="UTILITY FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;
provides several functions that operate outside of the
normal class hierarchy. Of these, only &quot;bibloop&quot;
is likely to be of much use to you in writing everyday
BibTeX-hacking programs; the other two
(&quot;check_class&quot; and &quot;display_list&quot;) are
mainly provided for the use of other modules in the library.
They are documented here mainly for completeness, but also
because they might conceivably be useful in other
circumstances. <br>
bibloop ( <small>ACTION, FILES</small> [,
<small>DEST</small> ])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Loops over all entries in a set
of BibTeX files, performing some caller-supplied action on
each entry. <small>FILES</small> should be a reference to
the list of filenames to process, and <small>ACTION</small>
a reference to a subroutine that will be called on each
entry. <small>DEST,</small> if given, should be a
&quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; object (opened for output) to
which entries might be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The subroutine
referenced by <small>ACTION</small> is called with exactly
one argument: the &quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot; object
representing the entry currently being processed.
Information about both the entry itself and the file where
it originated is available through this object; see
Text::BibTeX::Entry. The <small>ACTION</small> subroutine is
only called if the entry was successfully parsed; any syntax
errors will result in a warning message being printed, and
that entry being skipped. Note that <i>all</i> successfully
parsed entries are passed to the <small>ACTION</small>
subroutine, even &quot;preamble&quot;, &quot;string&quot;,
and &quot;comment&quot; entries. To skip these
pseudo-entries and only process &quot;regular&quot; entries,
then your action subroutine should look something like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub action {
<br>
my $entry = shift; <br>
return unless $entry&minus;&gt;metatype == BTE_REGULAR; <br>
# process $entry ... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If your action
subroutine needs any more arguments, you can just create a
closure (anonymous subroutine) as a wrapper, and pass it to
&quot;bibloop&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub action {
<br>
my ($entry, $extra_stuff) = @_; <br>
# ... <br>
} <br>
my $extra = ...; <br>
Text::BibTeX::bibloop (sub { &amp;action ($_[0], $extra) },
\@files);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<small>ACTION</small> subroutine returns a true value and
<small>DEST</small> was given, then the processed entry will
be written to <small>DEST.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">check_class ( <small>PACKAGE,
DESCRIPTION, SUPERCLASS, METHODS</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ensures that a
<small>PACKAGE</small> implements a class meeting certain
requirements. First, it inspects Perl&rsquo;s symbol tables
to ensure that a package named <small>PACKAGE</small>
actually exists. Then, it ensures that the class named by
<small>PACKAGE</small> derives from
<small>SUPERCLASS</small> (using the universal method
&quot;isa&quot;). This derivation might be through multiple
inheritance, or through several generations of a class
hierarchy; the only requirement is that
<small>SUPERCLASS</small> is somewhere in
<small>PACKAGE</small> &rsquo;s tree of base classes.
Finally, it checks that <small>PACKAGE</small> provides each
method listed in <small>METHODS</small> (a reference to a
list of method names). This is done with the universal
method &quot;can&quot;, so the methods might actually come
from one of <small>PACKAGE</small> &rsquo;s base
classes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>DESCRIPTION</small>
should be a brief string describing the class that was
expected to be provided by <small>PACKAGE.</small> It is
used for generating warning messages if any of the class
requirements are not met.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is mainly
used by the supervisory code in
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Structure&quot;, to ensure that
user-supplied structure modules meet the rules required of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">display_list ( <small>LIST,
QUOTE</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Converts a list of strings to
the grammatical conventions of a human language (currently,
only English rules are supported). <small>LIST</small> must
be a reference to a list of strings. If this list is empty,
the empty string is returned. If it has one element, then
just that element is returned. If it has two elements, then
they are joined with the string &quot; and &quot; and the
resulting string is returned. Otherwise, the list has
<i>N</i> elements for <i>N</i> &gt;= 3; elements
1..<i>N</i>&minus;1 are joined with commas, and the final
element is tacked on with an intervening &quot;, and
&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<small>QUOTE</small> is true, then each string is encased in
single quotes before anything else is done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is used
elsewhere in the library for two very distinct purposes: for
generating warning messages describing lists of fields that
should be present or are conflicting in an entry, and for
generating lists of author names in formatted
bibliographies.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS FUNCTIONS
<a name="MISCELLANEOUS FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
loading the &quot;File&quot; and &quot;Entry&quot; modules,
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; loads the <small>XSUB</small> code
which bridges the Perl modules to the underlying C library,
<b>btparse</b>. This <small>XSUB</small> code provides a
number of miscellaneous utility functions, most of which are
put into other packages in the &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;
family for use by the corresponding classes. (For instance,
the <small>XSUB</small> code loaded by
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; provides a function
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry::parse&quot;, which is actually
documented as the &quot;parse&quot; method of the
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot;
class&minus;&minus;&minus;see Text::BibTeX::Entry. However,
for completeness this function&minus;&minus;&minus;and all
the other functions that become available when you &quot;use
Text::BibTeX&quot;&minus;&minus;&minus;are at least
mentioned here. The only functions from this group that
you&rsquo;re ever likely to use are described in
&quot;Generic string-processing functions&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Startup/shutdown
functions</b> <br>
These just initialize and shutdown the underlying C library.
Don&rsquo;t call either one of them; the
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; startup/shutdown code takes care of
it as appropriate. They&rsquo;re just mentioned here for
completeness. <br>
initialize () <br>
cleanup ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Generic
string-processing functions</b> <br>
split_list ( <small>STRING, DELIM</small> [,
<small>FILENAME</small> [, <small>LINE</small> [,
<small>DESCRIPTION</small> [, <small><br>
OPTS</small> ]]]])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Splits a string on a fixed
delimiter according to the BibTeX rules for splitting up
lists of names. With BibTeX, the delimiter is hard-coded as
&quot;and&quot;; here, you can supply any string. Instances
of <small>DELIM</small> in <small>STRING</small> are
considered delimiters if they are at brace-depth zero,
surrounded by whitespace, and not at the beginning or end of
<small>STRING</small> ; the comparison is case-insensitive.
See bt_split_names for full details of how splitting is done
(it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> the same as Perl&rsquo;s
&quot;split&quot; function). <small>OPTS</small> is a hash
ref of the same binmode and normalization arguments as with,
e.g. Text::BibTeX::File&minus;&gt;<b>open()</b>. split_list
calls <b>isplit_list()</b> internally but handles
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> conversion and normalization, if
requested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
list of strings resulting from splitting
<small>STRING</small> on <small>DELIM.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">isplit_list ( <small>STRING,
DELIM</small> [, <small>FILENAME</small> [,
<small>LINE</small> [, <small>DESCRIPTION</small> ]]])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Splits a string on a fixed
delimiter according to the BibTeX rules for splitting up
lists of names. With BibTeX, the delimiter is hard-coded as
&quot;and&quot;; here, you can supply any string. Instances
of <small>DELIM</small> in <small>STRING</small> are
considered delimiters if they are at brace-depth zero,
surrounded by whitespace, and not at the beginning or end of
<small>STRING</small> ; the comparison is case-insensitive.
See bt_split_names for full details of how splitting is done
(it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> the same as Perl&rsquo;s
&quot;split&quot; function). This function returns bytes.
Use Text::BibTeX::split_list to specify the same binmode and
normalization arguments as with, e.g.
Text::BibTeX::File&minus;&gt;<b>open()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
list of strings resulting from splitting
<small>STRING</small> on <small>DELIM.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">purify_string (
<small>STRING</small> [, <small>OPTIONS</small> ])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;Purifies&quot;
<small>STRING</small> in the BibTeX way (usually for
generation of sort keys). See bt_misc for details; note
that, unlike the C interface, &quot;purify_string&quot; does
<i>not</i> modify <small>STRING</small> in-place. A purified
copy of the input string is returned.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>OPTIONS</small>
is currently unused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">change_case ( <small>TRANSFORM,
STRING</small> [, <small>OPTIONS</small> ])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Transforms the case of
<small>STRING</small> according to <small>TRANSFORM</small>
(a single character, one of 'u', 'l', or 't'). See bt_misc
for details; again, &quot;change_case&quot; differs from the
C interface in that <small>STRING</small> is not modified
in&minus;place&minus;&minus;&minus;the input string is
copied, and the transformed copy is returned.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Entry-parsing
functions</b> <br>
Although these functions are provided by the
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; module, they are actually in the
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot; package. That&rsquo;s
because they are implemented in C, and thus loaded with the
<small>XSUB</small> code that &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;
loads; however, they are actually methods in the
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Entry&quot; class. Thus, they are
documented as methods in Text::BibTeX::Entry. <br>
parse ( <small>ENTRY_STRUCT, FILENAME, FILEHANDLE</small> )
<br>
parse_s ( <small>ENTRY_STRUCT, TEXT</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Macro table
functions</b> <br>
These functions allow direct access to the macro table
maintained by <b>btparse</b>, the C library underlying
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;. In the normal course of events,
macro definitions always accumulate, and are only defined as
a result of parsing a macro definition (@string) entry.
<b>btparse</b> never deletes old macro definitions for you,
and doesn&rsquo;t have any built-in default macros. If, for
example, you wish to start fresh with new macros for every
file, use &quot;delete_all_macros&quot;. If you wish to
pre-define certain macros, use &quot;add_macro_text&quot;.
(But note that the &quot;Bib&quot; structure, as part of its
mission to emulate BibTeX 0.99, defines the standard
&quot;month name&quot; macros for you.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also
bt_macros in the <b>btparse</b> documentation for a
description of the C interface to these functions. <br>
add_macro_text ( <small>MACRO, TEXT</small> [,
<small>FILENAME</small> [, <small>LINE</small> ]])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines a new macro, or
redefines an old one. <small>MACRO</small> is the name of
the macro, and <small>TEXT</small> is the text it should
expand to. <small>FILENAME</small> and <small>LINE</small>
are just used to generate any warnings about the macro
definition. The only such warning occurs when you redefine
an old macro: its value is overridden, and
&quot;add_macro_text()&quot; issues a warning saying so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">delete_macro (
<small>MACRO</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Deletes a macro from the macro
table. If <small>MACRO</small> isn&rsquo;t defined, takes no

<h2>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
<a name="BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;
inherits several limitations from its base C library,
<b>btparse</b>; see &quot; <small>BUGS AND
LIMITATIONS&quot;</small> in btparse for details. In
addition, &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; will not work with a Perl
binary built using the &quot;sfio&quot; library. This is
because Perl&rsquo;s I/O abstraction layer does not extend
to third-party C libraries that use stdio, and
<b>btparse</b> most certainly does use stdio.</p>
