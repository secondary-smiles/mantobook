<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Generators are
small executables placed in
/usr/lib/systemd/system&minus;generators/ and other
directories listed above. <b>systemd</b>(1) will execute
these binaries very early at bootup and at configuration
reload time &mdash; before unit files are loaded. Their main
purpose is to convert configuration and execution context
parameters that are not native to the service manager into
dynamically generated unit files, symlinks or unit file
drop&minus;ins, so that they can extend the unit file
hierarchy the service manager subsequently loads and
operates on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd</b>
will call each generator with three directory paths that are
to be used for generator output. In these three directories,
generators may dynamically generate unit files (regular
ones, instances, as well as templates), unit file .d/
drop&minus;ins, and create symbolic links to unit files to
add additional dependencies, create aliases, or instantiate
existing templates. Those directories are included in the
unit load path, allowing generated configuration to extend
or override existing definitions. For tests, generators may
be called with just one argument; the generator should
assume that all three paths are the same in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Directory paths
for generator output differ by priority: .../generator.early
has priority higher than the admin configuration in /etc/,
while .../generator has lower priority than /etc/ but higher
than vendor configuration in /usr/, and .../generator.late
has priority lower than all other configuration. See the
next section and the discussion of unit load paths and unit
overriding in <b>systemd.unit</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Generators are
loaded from a set of paths determined during compilation, as
listed above. System and user generators are loaded from
directories with names ending in system&minus;generators/
and user&minus;generators/, respectively. Generators found
in directories listed earlier override the ones with the
same name in directories lower in the list. A symlink to
/dev/null or an empty file can be used to mask a generator,
thereby preventing it from running. Please note that the
order of the two directories with the highest priority is
reversed with respect to the unit load path, and generators
in /run/ overwrite those in /etc/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After
installing new generators or updating the configuration,
<b>systemctl daemon&minus;reload</b> may be executed. This
will delete the previous configuration created by
generators, re&minus;run all generators, and cause
<b>systemd</b> to reload units from disk. See
<b>systemctl</b>(1) for more information.</p>

<h2>OUTPUT DIRECTORIES
<a name="OUTPUT DIRECTORIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Generators are
invoked with three arguments: paths to directories where
generators can place their generated unit files or symlinks.
By default those paths are runtime directories that are
included in the search path of <b>systemd</b>, but a
generator may be called with different paths for debugging
purposes. If only one argument is provided, the generator
should use the same directory as the the three output
paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1.
<i>normal&minus;dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In normal use
this is /run/systemd/generator in case of the system
generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/generator in case of
the user generators. Unit files placed in this directory
take precedence over vendor unit configuration but not over
native user/administrator unit configuration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2.
<i>early&minus;dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In normal use
this is /run/systemd/generator.early in case of the system
generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/generator.early in
case of the user generators. Unit files placed in this
directory override unit files in /usr/, /run/ and /etc/.
This means that unit files placed in this directory take
precedence over all normal configuration, both vendor and
user/administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3.
<i>late&minus;dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In normal use
this is /run/systemd/generator.late in case of the system
generators and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/generator.late in
case of the user generators. This directory may be used to
extend the unit file tree without overriding any other unit
files. Any native configuration files supplied by the vendor
or user/administrator take precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note:
generators <i>must not</i> write to other locations or
otherwise make changes to system state. Generator output is
supposed to last only until the next
<b>daemon&minus;reload</b> or <b>daemon&minus;reexec</b>; if
the generator is replaced or masked, its effects should
vanish.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT
<a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The service
manager sets a number of environment variables when invoking
generator executables. They carry information about the
execution context of the generator, in order to simplify
conditionalizing generators to specific environments. The
following environment variables are set:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>$SYSTEMD_SCOPE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the generator is invoked
from the system service manager this variable is set to
&quot;system&quot;; if invoked from the per&minus;user
service manager it is set to &quot;user&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>$SYSTEMD_IN_INITRD</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the generator is run as part
of an initrd this is set to &quot;1&quot;. If it is run from
the regular host (i.e. after the transition from initrd to
host) it is set to &quot;0&quot;. This environment variable
is only set for system generators.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>$SYSTEMD_FIRST_BOOT</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this boot&minus;up cycle is
considered a &quot;first boot&quot;, this is set to
&quot;1&quot;; if it is a subsequent, regular boot it is set
to &quot;0&quot;. For details see the documentation of
<i>ConditionFirstBoot=</i> in <b>systemd.unit</b>(5). This
environment variable is only set for system generators.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>$SYSTEMD_VIRTUALIZATION</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the service manager is run
in a virtualized environment, <i>$SYSTEMD_VIRTUALIZATION</i>
is set to a pair of strings, separated by a colon. The first
string is either &quot;vm&quot; or &quot;container&quot;,
categorizing the type of virtualization. The second string
identifies the implementation of the virtualization
technology. If no virtualization is detected this variable
will not be set. This data is identical to what
<b>systemd-detect-virt</b>(1) detects and reports, and uses
the same vocabulary of virtualization implementation
identifiers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>$SYSTEMD_ARCHITECTURE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This variable is set to a short
identifier of the reported architecture of the system. For
details about defined values, see documentation of
<i>ConditionArchitecture=</i> in <b>systemd.unit</b>(5).</p>

<h2>NOTES ABOUT WRITING GENERATORS
<a name="NOTES ABOUT WRITING GENERATORS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; All
generators are executed in parallel. That means all
executables are started at the very same time and need to be
able to cope with this parallelism.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Generators are run very early at boot and cannot rely on any
external services. They may not talk to any other process.
That includes simple things such as logging to
<b>syslog</b>(3), or <b>systemd</b> itself (this means: no
<b>systemctl</b>(1))! Non&minus;essential file systems like
/var/ and /home/ are mounted after generators have run.
Generators can however rely on the most basic kernel
functionality to be available, as well as mounted /sys/,
/proc/, /dev/, /usr/ and /run/ file systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Units
written by generators are removed when the configuration is
reloaded. That means the lifetime of the generated units is
closely bound to the reload cycles of <b>systemd</b>
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Generators should only be used to generate unit files,
.d/*.conf drop&minus;ins for them and symlinks to them, not
any other kind of non&minus;unit related configuration. Due
to the lifecycle logic mentioned above, generators are not a
good fit to generate dynamic configuration for other
services. If you need to generate dynamic configuration for
other services, do so in normal services you order before
the service in question.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that using
the <i>StandardInputData=</i>/<i>StandardInputText=</i>
settings of service unit files (see <b>systemd.exec</b>(5)),
it is possible to make arbitrary input data (including
daemon&minus;specific configuration) part of the unit
definitions, which often might be sufficient to embed data
or configuration for other programs into unit files in a
native fashion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Since
<b>syslog</b>(3) is not available (see above), log messages
have to be written to /dev/kmsg instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
generator should always include its own name in a comment at
the top of the generated file, so that the user can easily
figure out which component created or amended a particular
unit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>SourcePath=</i> directive should be used in generated
files to specify the source configuration file they are
generated from. This makes things more easily understood by
the user and also has the benefit that systemd can warn the
user about configuration files that changed on disk but have
not been read yet by systemd. The <i>SourcePath=</i> value
does not have to be a file in a physical filesystem. For
example, in the common case of the generator looking at the
kernel command line, <b>SourcePath=/proc/cmdline</b> should
be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Generators may write out dynamic unit files or just hook
unit files into other units with the usual .wants/ or
.requires/ symlinks. Often, it is nicer to simply
instantiate a template unit file from /usr/ with a generator
instead of writing out entirely dynamic unit files. Of
course, this works only if a single parameter is to be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If you
are careful, you can implement generators in shell scripts.
We do recommend C code however, since generators are
executed synchronously and hence delay the entire boot if
they are slow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Regarding overriding semantics: there are two rules we try
to follow when thinking about the overriding semantics:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">1. User
configuration should override vendor configuration. This
(mostly) means that stuff from /etc/ should override stuff
from /usr/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">2. Native
configuration should override non&minus;native
configuration. This (mostly) means that stuff you generate
should never override native unit files for the same
purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Of these two
rules the first rule is probably the more important one and
breaks the second one sometimes. Hence, when deciding
whether to use argv[1], argv[2], or argv[3], your default
choice should probably be argv[1].</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Instead
of heading off now and writing all kind of generators for
legacy configuration file formats, please think twice! It is
often a better idea to just deprecate old stuff instead of
keeping it artificially alive.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;1.&nbsp;systemd&minus;fstab&minus;generator</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd-fstab-generator</b>(8)
converts /etc/fstab into native mount units. It uses argv[1]
as location to place the generated unit files in order to
allow the user to override /etc/fstab with their own native
unit files, but also to ensure that /etc/fstab overrides any
vendor default from /usr/.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After editing
/etc/fstab, the user should invoke <b>systemctl
daemon&minus;reload</b>. This will re&minus;run all
generators and cause <b>systemd</b> to reload units from
disk. To actually mount new directories added to fstab,
<b>systemctl start</b> <i>/path/to/mountpoint</i> or
<b>systemctl start local&minus;fs.target</b> may be
used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;systemd&minus;system&minus;update&minus;generator</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd-system-update-generator</b>(8)
temporarily redirects default.target to
system&minus;update.target, if a system update is scheduled.
Since this needs to override the default user configuration
for default.target, it uses argv[2]. For details about this
logic, see <b>systemd.offline-updates</b>(7).</p>
