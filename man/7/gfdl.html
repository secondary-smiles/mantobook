<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The purpose of
this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <i>free</i> in the sense of
freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy
and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License
preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit
for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This License is
a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same
sense. It complements the <small>GNU</small> General Public
License, which is a copyleft license designed for free
software.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">We have
designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
free software, because free software needs free
documentation: a free program should come with manuals
providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this
License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used
for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this
License principally for works whose purpose is instruction
or reference.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This License
applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a
notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited
in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated
herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such
manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if
you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring
permission under copyright law.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work
containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into
another language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a
front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively
with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the
Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall subject (or to
related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document
is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section
may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
a matter of historical connection with the subject or with
related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical,
ethical or political position regarding them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary
Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License. If a section does
not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may
contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not
identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Cover
Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are
listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
notice that says that the Document is released under this
License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a
Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a
machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose
specification is available to the general public, that is
suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels)
generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made
in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or
absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An
image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot;
is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Examples of
suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format,
LaTeX input format, <small>SGML</small> or
<small>XML</small> using a publicly available
<small>DTD,</small> and standard-conforming simple
<small>HTML,</small> PostScript or <small>PDF</small>
designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
image formats include <small>PNG, XCF</small> and
<small>JPG.</small> Opaque formats include proprietary
formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
processors, <small>SGML</small> or <small>XML</small> for
which the <small>DTD</small> and/or processing tools are not
generally available, and the machine-generated
<small>HTML,</small> PostScript or <small>PDF</small>
produced by some word processors for output purposes
only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The &quot;Title
Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
the material this License requires to appear in the title
page. For works in formats which do not have any title page
as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most
prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title, preceding
the beginning of the body of the text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;publisher&quot; means any person or entity that
distributes copies of the Document to the public.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A section
&quot;Entitled <small>XYZ&quot;</small> means a named
subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely
<small>XYZ</small> or contains <small>XYZ</small> in
parentheses following text that translates
<small>XYZ</small> in another language. (Here
<small>XYZ</small> stands for a specific section name
mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
&quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or
&quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of
such a section when you modify the Document means that it
remains a section &quot;Entitled <small>XYZ&quot;</small>
according to this definition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The Document
may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These
Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by
reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming
warranties: any other implication that these Warranty
Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.</p>

copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to
those of this License. You may not use technical measures to
obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a
large enough number of copies you must also follow the
conditions in section 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You may also

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you publish
printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
and the Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover
Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry,
clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must
present the full title with all words of the title equally
prominent and visible. You may add other material on the
covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document
and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the required
texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly,
you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
adjacent pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you publish
or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more
than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or
with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which
the general network-using public has access to download
using public-standard network protocols a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent
steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain
thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
(directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is
requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the Document well before redistributing any large number of
copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
version of the Document.</p>

To use this License in a document you have written, include
a copy of the License in the document and put the following
copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Copyright (C)

with no Invariant Sections, no Front&minus;Cover Texts, and

Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section
entitled &quot;GNU <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &quot;with...Texts.&quot; line with this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">with the

combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to
suit the situation.</p>

recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your
