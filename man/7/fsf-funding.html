<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Funding Free
Software</b> <br>
If you want to have more free software a few years from now,
it makes sense for you to help encourage people to
contribute funds for its development. The most effective
approach known is to encourage commercial redistributors to
donate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users of free
software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their
selling price to free software
developers&minus;&minus;&minus;the Free Software Foundation,
and others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way to
convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them. So when you compare distributors, judge them
partly by how much they give to free software development.
Show distributors they must compete to be the one who gives
the most.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To make this
approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, &quot;We will donate ten dollars to the
Frobnitz project for each disk sold.&quot; Don&rsquo;t be
satisfied with a vague promise, such as &quot;A portion of
the profits are donated,&quot; since it doesn&rsquo;t give a
basis for comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even a precise
fraction &quot;of the profits from this disk&quot; is not
very meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated
business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the
sales price counts as profit. If the price you pay is $50,
ten percent of the profit is probably less than a dollar; it
might be a few cents, or nothing at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
redistributors do development work themselves. This is
useful too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire
how much they do, and what kind. Some kinds of development
make much more long-term difference than others. For
example, maintaining a separate version of a program
contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of
a program for the whole community contributes much. Easy new
ports contribute little, since someone else would surely do
them; difficult ports such as adding a new
<small>CPU</small> to the <small>GNU</small> Compiler
Collection contribute more; major new features or packages
contribute the most.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By establishing
the idea that supporting further development is &quot;the
proper thing to do&quot; when distributing free software for
a fee, we can assure a steady flow of resources into making
more free software.</p>
