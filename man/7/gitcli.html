<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
describes the convention used throughout Git CLI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many commands
take revisions (most often &quot;commits&quot;, but
sometimes &quot;tree&minus;ish&quot;, depending on the
context and command) and paths as their arguments. Here are
the rules:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Options
come first and then args. A subcommand may take dashed
options (which may take their own arguments, e.g.
&quot;&minus;&minus;max&minus;parents 2&quot;) and
arguments. You SHOULD give dashed options first and then
arguments. Some commands may accept dashed options after you
have already gave non&minus;option arguments (which may make
the command ambiguous), but you should not rely on it
(because eventually we may find a way to fix these ambiguity
by enforcing the &quot;options then args&quot; rule).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Revisions come first and then paths. E.g. in <b>git diff
v1.0 v2.0 arch/x86 include/asm&minus;x86</b>, <b>v1.0</b>
and <b>v2.0</b> are revisions and <b>arch/x86</b> and
<b>include/asm&minus;x86</b> are paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; When an
argument can be misunderstood as either a revision or a
path, they can be disambiguated by placing
<b>&minus;&minus;</b> between them. E.g. <b>git diff
&minus;&minus; HEAD</b> is, &quot;I have a file called HEAD
in my work tree. Please show changes between the version I
staged in the index and what I have in the work tree for
that file&quot;, not &quot;show difference between the HEAD
commit and the work tree as a whole&quot;. You can say
<b>git diff HEAD &minus;&minus;</b> to ask for the
latter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Without
disambiguating <b>&minus;&minus;</b>, Git makes a reasonable
guess, but errors out and asking you to disambiguate when
ambiguous. E.g. if you have a file called HEAD in your work
tree, <b>git diff HEAD</b> is ambiguous, and you have to say
either <b>git diff HEAD &minus;&minus;</b> or <b>git diff
&minus;&minus; HEAD</b> to disambiguate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Because
<b>&minus;&minus;</b> disambiguates revisions and paths in
some commands, it cannot be used for those commands to
separate options and revisions. You can use
<b>&minus;&minus;end&minus;of&minus;options</b> for this (it
also works for commands that do not distinguish between
revisions in paths, in which case it is simply an alias for
<b>&minus;&minus;</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When writing a
script that is expected to handle random user&minus;input,
it is a good practice to make it explicit which arguments
are which by placing disambiguating <b>&minus;&minus;</b> at
appropriate places.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Many
commands allow wildcards in paths, but you need to protect
them from getting globbed by the shell. These two mean
different things:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git restore
*.c <br>
$ git restore \*.c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The former lets
your shell expand the fileglob, and you are asking the
dot&minus;C files in your working tree to be overwritten
with the version in the index. The latter passes the
<b>*.c</b> to Git, and you are asking the paths in the index
that match the pattern to be checked out to your working
tree. After running <b>git add hello.c; rm hello.c</b>, you
will <i>not</i> see <b>hello.c</b> in your working tree with
the former, but with the latter you will.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Just as
the filesystem <i>.</i> (period) refers to the current
directory, using a <i>.</i> as a repository name in Git (a
dot&minus;repository) is a relative path and means your
current repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are the
rules regarding the &quot;flags&quot; that you should follow
when you are scripting Git:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
It&rsquo;s preferred to use the non&minus;dashed form of Git
commands, which means that you should prefer <b>git foo</b>
to <b>git&minus;foo</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Splitting short options to separate words (prefer <b>git foo
&minus;a &minus;b</b> to <b>git foo &minus;ab</b>, the
latter may not even work).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; When a
command&minus;line option takes an argument, use the
<i>stuck</i> form. In other words, write <b>git foo
&minus;oArg</b> instead of <b>git foo &minus;o Arg</b> for
short options, and <b>git foo
&minus;&minus;long&minus;opt=Arg</b> instead of <b>git foo
&minus;&minus;long&minus;opt Arg</b> for long options. An
option that takes optional option&minus;argument must be
written in the <i>stuck</i> form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; When you
give a revision parameter to a command, make sure the
parameter is not ambiguous with a name of a file in the work
tree. E.g. do not write <b>git log &minus;1 HEAD</b> but
write <b>git log &minus;1 HEAD &minus;&minus;</b>; the
former will not work if you happen to have a file called
<b>HEAD</b> in the work tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Many
commands allow a long option <b>&minus;&minus;option</b> to
be abbreviated only to their unique prefix (e.g. if there is
no other option whose name begins with <b>opt</b>, you may
be able to spell <b>&minus;&minus;opt</b> to invoke the
<b>&minus;&minus;option</b> flag), but you should fully
spell them out when writing your scripts; later versions of
Git may introduce a new option whose name shares the same
prefix, e.g. <b>&minus;&minus;optimize</b>, to make a short
prefix that used to be unique no longer unique.</p>

<h2>ENHANCED OPTION PARSER
<a name="ENHANCED OPTION PARSER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From the Git
1.5.4 series and further, many Git commands (not all of them
at the time of the writing though) come with an enhanced
option parser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is a list
of the facilities provided by this option parser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Magic
Options</b> <br>
Commands which have the enhanced option parser activated all
understand a couple of magic command&minus;line options:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;h</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">gives a pretty printed usage of
the command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git describe
&minus;h <br>
usage: git describe [&lt;options&gt;]
&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;* <br>
or: git describe [&lt;options&gt;] &minus;&minus;dirty</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;contains
find the tag that comes after the commit <br>
&minus;&minus;debug debug search strategy on stderr <br>
&minus;&minus;all use any ref <br>
&minus;&minus;tags use any tag, even unannotated <br>
&minus;&minus;long always use long format <br>
&minus;&minus;abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;] use &lt;n&gt; digits to
display SHA&minus;1s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that some
subcommand (e.g. <b>git grep</b>) may behave differently
when there are things on the command line other than
<b>&minus;h</b>, but <b>git subcmd &minus;h</b> without
anything else on the command line is meant to consistently
give the usage.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;help&minus;all</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some Git commands take options
that are only used for plumbing or that are deprecated, and
such options are hidden from the default usage. This option
gives the full list of options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Negating
options</b> <br>
Options with long option names can be negated by prefixing
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;</b>. For example, <b>git
branch</b> has the option <b>&minus;&minus;track</b> which
is <i>on</i> by default. You can use
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;track</b> to override that
behaviour. The same goes for <b>&minus;&minus;color</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;color</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Aggregating
short options</b> <br>
Commands that support the enhanced option parser allow you
to aggregate short options. This means that you can for
example use <b>git rm &minus;rf</b> or <b>git clean
&minus;fdx</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Abbreviating
long options</b> <br>
Commands that support the enhanced option parser accepts
unique prefix of a long option as if it is fully spelled
out, but use this with a caution. For example, <b>git commit
&minus;&minus;amen</b> behaves as if you typed <b>git commit
&minus;&minus;amend</b>, but that is true only until a later
version of Git introduces another option that shares the
same prefix, e.g. <b>git commit &minus;&minus;amenity</b>
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Separating
argument from the option</b> <br>
You can write the mandatory option parameter to an option as
a separate word on the command line. That means that all the
following uses work:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git foo
&minus;&minus;long&minus;opt=Arg <br>
$ git foo &minus;&minus;long&minus;opt Arg <br>
$ git foo &minus;oArg <br>
$ git foo &minus;o Arg</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, this
is <b>NOT</b> allowed for switches with an optional value,
where the <i>stuck</i> form must be used:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git describe
&minus;&minus;abbrev HEAD # correct <br>
$ git describe &minus;&minus;abbrev=10 HEAD # correct <br>
$ git describe &minus;&minus;abbrev 10 HEAD # NOT WHAT YOU
MEANT</p>

<h2>NOTES ON FREQUENTLY CONFUSED OPTIONS
<a name="NOTES ON FREQUENTLY CONFUSED OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many commands
that can work on files in the working tree and/or in the
index can take <b>&minus;&minus;cached</b> and/or
<b>&minus;&minus;index</b> options. Sometimes people
incorrectly think that, because the index was originally
called cache, these two are synonyms. They are <b>not</b>
&mdash; these two options mean very different things.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
<b>&minus;&minus;cached</b> option is used to ask a command
that usually works on files in the working tree to
<b>only</b> work with the index. For example, <b>git
grep</b>, when used without a commit to specify from which
commit to look for strings in, usually works on files in the
working tree, but with the <b>&minus;&minus;cached</b>
option, it looks for strings in the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
<b>&minus;&minus;index</b> option is used to ask a command
that usually works on files in the working tree to
<b>also</b> affect the index. For example, <b>git stash
apply</b> usually merges changes recorded in a stash entry
to the working tree, but with the <b>&minus;&minus;index</b>
option, it also merges changes to the index as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
apply</b> command can be used with
<b>&minus;&minus;cached</b> and <b>&minus;&minus;index</b>
(but not at the same time). Usually the command only affects
the files in the working tree, but with
<b>&minus;&minus;index</b>, it patches both the files and
their index entries, and with <b>&minus;&minus;cached</b>,
it modifies only the index entries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Some
other commands that also work on files in the working tree
and/or in the index can take <b>&minus;&minus;staged</b>
and/or <b>&minus;&minus;worktree</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
<b>&minus;&minus;staged</b> is exactly like
<b>&minus;&minus;cached</b>, which is used to ask a command
to only work on the index, not the working tree.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
<b>&minus;&minus;worktree</b> is the opposite, to ask a
command to work on the working tree only, not the
index.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The two options can be specified together to ask a command
to work on both the index and the working tree.</font></p>
