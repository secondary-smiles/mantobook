&minus; OpenRTE Hostfile and HOST Behavior: Overview of
OpenRTE&rsquo;s support for user-supplied hostfiles and
comma-delimited lists of hosts</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenRTE
supports several levels of user-specified host lists based
on an established precedence order. Users can specify a
<i>default hostfile</i> that contains a list of nodes
available to all app_contexts given on the command line.
Only <i>one</i> default hostfile can be provided for any
job. In addition, users can specify a <i>hostfile</i> that
contains a list of nodes to be used for a specific
app_context, or can provide a comma-delimited list of nodes
to be used for that app_context via the <i>-host</i> command
line option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The precedence
order applied to these various options depends to some
extent on the local environment. The following table
illustrates how host and hostfile directives work together
to define the set of hosts upon which a job will execute in
the absence of a resource manager (RM):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">default <br>
hostfile host hostfile Result <br>
---------- ------ ----------
----------------------------------------- <br>
unset unset unset Job is co-located with mpirun <br>
unset set unset Host defines resource list for the job <br>
unset unset set Hostfile defines resource list for the job
<br>
unset set set Hostfile defines resource list for the job,
<br>
then host filters the list to define the final <br>
set of nodes available to each application <br>
within the job <br>
set unset unset Default hostfile defines resource list for
the job <br>
set set unset Default hostfile defines resource list for the
job, <br>
then host filters the list to define the final <br>
set of nodes available to each application <br>
within the job <br>
set set set Default hostfile defines resource list for the
job, <br>
then hostfile filters the list, and then host filters <br>
the list to define the final set of nodes available <br>
to each application within the job</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This changes
somewhat in the presence of a RM as that entity specifies
the initial allocation of nodes. In this case, the default
hostfile, hostfile and host directives are all used to
filter the RM&rsquo;s specification so that a user can
utilize different portions of the allocation for different
jobs. This is done according to the same precedence order as
in the prior table, with the RM providing the initial pool
of nodes.</p>

<h2>RELATIVE INDEXING
<a name="RELATIVE INDEXING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once an initial
allocation has been specified (whether by an RM, default
hostfile, or hostfile), subsequent hostfile and -host
specifications can be made using relative indexing. This
allows a user to stipulate which hosts are to be used for a
given app_context without specifying the particular host
name, but rather its relative position in the
allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can
probably best be understood through consideration of a few
examples. Consider the case where an RM has allocated a set
of nodes to the user named &quot;foo1, foo2, foo3,
foo4&quot;. The user wants the first app_context to have
exclusive use of the first two nodes, and a second
app_context to use the last two nodes. Of course, the user
could printout the allocation to find the names of the nodes
allocated to them and then use -host to specify this layout,
but this is cumbersome and would require hand-manipulation
for every invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A simpler
method is to utilize OpenRTE&rsquo;s relative indexing
capability to specify the desired layout. In this case, a
command line of:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mpirun -pernode
-host +n1,+n2 ./app1 : -host +n3,+n4 ./app2</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would provide
the desired pattern. The &quot;+&quot; syntax indicates that
the information is being provided as a relative index to the
existing allocation. Two methods of relative indexing are
supported:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>+n&lt;#&gt;</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A relative index into the allocation referencing the
&lt;#&gt; node. OpenRTE will substitute the &lt;#&gt; node
in the allocation</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>+e[:&lt;#&gt;]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A request for &lt;#&gt; empty
nodes - i.e., OpenRTE is to substitute this reference with
&lt;#&gt; nodes that have not yet been used by any other
app_context. If the &quot;:&lt;#&gt;&quot; is not provided,
OpenRTE will substitute the reference with all empty nodes.
Note that OpenRTE does track the empty nodes that have been
assigned in this manner, so multiple uses of this option
will result in assignment of unique nodes up to the limit of
the available empty nodes. Requests for more empty nodes
than are available will generate an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Relative
indexing can be combined with absolute naming of hosts in
any arbitrary manner, and can be used in hostfiles as well
as with the -host command line option. In addition, any slot
specification provided in hostfiles will be respected -
thus, a user can specify that only a certain number of slots
from a relative indexed host are to be used for a given
app_context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another example
may help illustrate this point. Consider the case where a
user has a default hostfile containing:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dummy1 slots=4
<br>
dummy2 slots=4 <br>
dummy3 slots=4 <br>
dummy4 slots=4 <br>
dummy5 slots=4</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This may, for
example, be a hostfile that describes a set of commonly-used
resources that the user wishes to execute applications
against. For this particular application, the user plans to
map byslot, and wants the first two ranks to be on the
second node of any allocation, the next ranks to land on an
empty node, have one rank specifically on dummy4, the next
rank to be on the second node of the allocation again, and
finally any remaining ranks to be on whatever empty nodes
are left. To accomplish this, the user provides a hostfile
of:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">+n2 slots=2
<br>
+e:1 <br>
dummy4 slots=1 <br>
+n2 <br>
+e</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The user can
now use this information in combination with OpenRTE&rsquo;s
sequential mapper to obtain their specific layout:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">mpirun
--default-hostfile dummyhosts -hostfile mylayout -mca rmaps
seq ./my_app</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">which will
result in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rank0 being
mapped to dummy3 <br>
rank1 to dummy1 as the first empty node <br>
rank2 to dummy4 <br>
rank3 to dummy3 <br>
rank4 to dummy2 and rank5 to dummy5 as the last remaining
unused nodes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
sequential mapper ignores the number of slots arguments as
it only maps one rank at a time to each node in the
list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the default
round-robin mapper had been used, then the mapping would
have resulted in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ranks 0 and 1
being mapped to dummy3 since two slots were specified <br>
ranks 2-5 on dummy1 as the first empty node, which has four
slots <br>
rank6 on dummy4 since the hostfile specifies only a single
slot from that node is to be used <br>
ranks 7 and 8 on dummy3 since only two slots remain
available <br>
ranks 9-12 on dummy2 since it is the next available empty
node and has four slots <br>
ranks 13-16 on dummy5 since it is the last remaining unused
node and has four slots</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, the use
of relative indexing can allow for complex mappings to be
ported across allocations, including those obtained from
automated resource managers, without the need for manual
manipulation of scripts and/or command lines.</p>
