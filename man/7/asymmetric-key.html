<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">asymmetric
&minus; Kernel key type for holding asymmetric keys</p>

<h2>OVERVIEW
<a name="OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A kernel key of
<b>asymmetric</b> type acts as a handle to an asymmetric key
as used for public-key cryptography. The key material itself
may be held inside the kernel or it may be held in hardware
with operations being offloaded. This prevents direct user
access to the cryptographic material.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keys may be any
asymmetric type (RSA, ECDSA, ...) and may have both private
and public components present or just the public
component.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Asymmetric keys
can be made use of by both the kernel and userspace. The
kernel can make use of them for module signature
verification and kexec image verification for example.
Userspace is provided with a set of
<b>keyctl</b>(<b>KEYCTL_PKEY_*</b>) calls for querying and
using the key. These are wrapped by <b>libkeyutils</b> as
functions named <b>keyctl_pkey_*()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
asymmetric-type key can be loaded by the keyctl utility
using a command line like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">openssl x509
-in key.x509 -outform DER | <br>
keyctl padd asymmetric foo @s</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
asymmetric-type key can be viewed as a container that
comprises of a number of components: <br>
Parsers</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The asymmetric key parsers
attempt to identify the content of the payload blob and
extract useful data from it with which to instantiate the
key. The parser is only used when adding, instantiating or
updating a key and isn&rsquo;t thereafter associated with
the key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Available
parsers include ones that can deal with DER-encoded
<b>X.509</b>, DER-encoded <b>PKCS#8</b> and DER-encoded
<b>TPM</b>-wrapped blobs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Public and private keys</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These are the cryptographic
components of the key pair. The public half should always be
available, but the private half might not be. What
operations are available can be queried, as can the size of
the key. The key material may or may not actually reside in
the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Identifiers</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">In addition to the normal key
description (which can be generated by the parser), a number
of supplementary identifiers may be available that can be
searched for. These may be obtained, for example, by hashing
the public key material or from the subjectKeyIdentifier in
an X.509 certificate.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Identifier-based
searches are selected by passing as the description to
<b>keyctl_search</b>() a string constructed of hex
characters prefixed with either &quot;id:&quot; or
&quot;ex:&quot;. The &quot;id:&quot; prefix indicates that a
partial tail match is permissible whereas &quot;ex:&quot;
requires an exact match on the full string. The hex
characters indicate the data to match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Subtype</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is the driver inside the
kernel that accesses the key material and performs
operations on it. It might be entirely software-based or it
may offload the operations to a hardware key store, such as
a <b>TPM</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
expiry times from the payload are ignored as these patches
may be used during boot before the system clock is set.</p>

<h2>PARSERS
<a name="PARSERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The asymmetric
key parsers can handle keys in a number of forms:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>X.509</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>DER-encoded X.509 certificates can be accepted. Two
identifiers are constructed: one from from the certificate
issuer and serial number and the other from the
subjectKeyIdentifier, if present. If left blank, the key
description will be filled in from the subject field plus
either the subjectKeyIdentifier or the serialNumber. Only
the public key is filled in and only the encrypt and verify
operations are supported.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The signature
on the X.509 certificate may be checked by the keyring it is
being added to and it may also be rejected if the key is
blacklisted.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>PKCS#8</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Unencrypted DER-encoded PKCS#8
key data containers can be accepted. Currently no
identifiers are constructed. The private key and the public
key are loaded from the PKCS#8 blobs. Encrypted PKCS#8 is
not currently supported.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>TPM-Wrapped keys</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">DER-encoded TPM-wrapped TSS key
blobs can be accepted. Currently no identifiers are
constructed. The public key is extracted from the blob but
the private key is expected to be resident in the TPM.
Encryption and signature verification is done in software,
but decryption and signing are offloaded to the TPM so as
not to expose the private key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This parser
only supports TPM-1.2 wrappings and enc=pkcs1 encoding type.
It also uses a hard-coded null SRK password;
password-protected SRKs are not yet supported.</p>

<h2>USERSPACE API
<a name="USERSPACE API"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the standard keyutils library functions, such as
<i>keyctl_update</i>(), there are five calls specific to the
asymmetric key type (though they are open to being used by
other key types also):</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><i>keyctl_pkey_query</i>()
<i><br>
keyctl_pkey_encrypt</i>() <i><br>
keyctl_pkey_decrypt</i>() <i><br>
keyctl_pkey_sign</i>() <i><br>
keyctl_pkey_verify</i>()</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The query
function can be used to retrieve information about an
asymmetric key, such as the key size, the amount of space
required by buffers for the other operations and which
operations are actually supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The other
operations form two pairs: encrypt/decrypt and create/verify
signature. Not all of these operations will necessarily be
available; typically, encrypt and verify only require the
public key to be available whereas decrypt and sign require
the private key as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of these
operations take an information string parameter that
supplies additional information such as encoding type/form
and the password(s) needed to unlock/unwrap the key. This
takes the form of a comma-separated list of
&quot;key[=value]&quot; pairs, the exact set of which
depends on the subtype driver used by a particular key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Available
parameters include: <br>
enc=&lt;type&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The encoding type for use in an
encrypted blob or a signature. An example might be
&quot;enc=pkcs1&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hash=&lt;name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The name of the hash algorithm
that was used to digest the data to be signed. Note that
this is only used to construct any encoding that is used in
a signature. The data to be signed or verified must have
been parsed by the caller and the hash passed to
<i>keyctl_pkey_sign</i>() or <i>keyctl_pkey_verify</i>()
beforehand. An example might be &quot;hash=sha256&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that not
all parameters are used by all subtypes.</p>

<h2>RESTRICTED KEYRINGS
<a name="RESTRICTED KEYRINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An additional
keyutils function, <i>keyctl_restrict_keyring</i>(), can be
used to gate a keyring so that a new key can only be added
to the affected keyring if (a) it&rsquo;s an asymmetric key,
(b) it&rsquo;s validly signed by a key in some appropriate
keyring and (c) it&rsquo;s not blacklisted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">keyctl_restrict_keyring(keyring,
&quot;asymmetric&quot;, <br>

&quot;key_or_keyring:&lt;signing-key&gt;[:chain]&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where
<i>&lt;signing-key&gt;</i> is the ID of a key or a ring of
keys that act as the authority to permit a new key to be
added to the keyring. The <i>chain</i> flag indicates that
keys that have been added to the keyring may also be used to
verify new keys. Authorising keys must themselves be
asymmetric-type keys that can be used to do a signature
verification on the key being added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that there
are various system keyrings visible to the root user that
may permit additional keys to be added. These are typically
gated by keys that already exist, preventing unauthorised
keys from being used for such things as module
verification.</p>

<h2>BLACKLISTING
<a name="BLACKLISTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
attempt is made to add a key to the kernel, a hash of the
public key is checked against the <b>blacklist.</b> This is
a system keyring named <b>.blacklist</b> and contains keys
of type <b>blacklist</b>. If the blacklist contains a key
whose description matches the hash of the new key, that new
key will be rejected with error <b>EKEYREJECTED</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The blacklist
keyring may be loaded from multiple sources, including a
list compiled into the kernel and the UEFI <b>dbx</b>
variable. Further hashes may also be blacklisted by the
administrator. Note that blacklisting is not retroactive, so
an asymmetric key that is already on the system cannot be
blacklisted by adding a matching blacklist entry later.</p>

<h2>VERSIONS
<a name="VERSIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>asymmetric</b> key type first appeared in v3.7 of the
Linux kernel, the <b>restriction</b> function in v4.11 and
the <b>public key operations</b> in v4.20.</p>
