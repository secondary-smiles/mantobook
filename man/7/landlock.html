<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Landlock is an
access-control system that enables any processes to securely
restrict themselves and their future children. Because
Landlock is a stackable Linux Security Module (LSM), it
makes it possible to create safe security sandboxes as new
security layers in addition to the existing system-wide
access-controls. This kind of sandbox is expected to help
mitigate the security impact of bugs, and unexpected or
malicious behaviors in applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Landlock
security policy is a set of access rights (e.g., open a file
in read-only, make a directory, etc.) tied to a file
hierarchy. Such policy can be configured and enforced by
processes for themselves using three system calls:</p>

<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p><b>landlock_restrict_self</b>(2) enforces a ruleset on
the calling thread.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To be able to
use these system calls, the running kernel must support
Landlock and it must be enabled at boot time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Landlock
rules</b> <br>
A Landlock rule describes an action on an object. An object
is currently a file hierarchy, and the related filesystem
actions are defined with access rights (see
<b>landlock_add_rule</b>(2)). A set of rules is aggregated
in a ruleset, which can then restrict the thread enforcing
it, and its future children.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Filesystem
actions</b> <br>
These flags enable to restrict a sandboxed process to a set
of actions on files and directories. Files or directories
opened before the sandboxing are not subject to these
restrictions. See <b>landlock_add_rule</b>(2) and
<b>landlock_create_ruleset</b>(2) for more context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A file can only
receive these access rights: <b><br>
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Execute a file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Open a file with write
access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">When opening
files for writing, you will often additionally need the
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE</b> right. In many cases,
these system calls truncate existing files when overwriting
them (e.g., <b>creat</b>(2)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Open a file with read
access.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Truncate a file with
<b>truncate</b>(2), <b>ftruncate</b>(2), <b>creat</b>(2), or
<b>open</b>(2) with <b>O_TRUNC</b>. Whether an opened file
can be truncated with <b>ftruncate</b>(2) is determined
during <b>open</b>(2), in the same way as read and write
permissions are checked during <b>open</b>(2) using
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE</b> and
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE</b>. This access right is
available since the third version of the Landlock ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A directory can
receive access rights related to files or directories. The
following access right is applied to the directory itself,
and the directories beneath it: <b><br>
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Open a directory or list its
content.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
following access rights only apply to the content of a
directory, not the directory itself: <b><br>
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove an empty directory or
rename one.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Unlink (or rename) a file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_CHAR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create (or rename or link) a
character device.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create (or rename) a
directory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create (or rename or link) a
regular file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create (or rename or link) a
UNIX domain socket.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_FIFO</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create (or rename or link) a
named pipe.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_BLOCK</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create (or rename or link) a
block device.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SYM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create (or rename or link) a
symbolic link.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Link or rename a file from or
to a different directory (i.e., reparent a file
hierarchy).</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This access
right is available since the second version of the Landlock
ABI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
only access right which is denied by default by any ruleset,
even if the right is not specified as handled at ruleset
creation time. The only way to make a ruleset grant this
right is to explicitly allow it for a specific directory by
adding a matching rule to the ruleset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In particular,
when using the first Landlock ABI version, Landlock will
always deny attempts to reparent files between different
directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the source and destination directories having the
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER</b> access right, the attempted
link or rename operation must meet the following
constraints:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>The reparented file may not gain more access rights in
the destination directory than it previously had in the
source directory. If this is attempted, the operation
results in an <b>EXDEV</b> error.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>When linking or renaming, the
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_</b><i>*</i> right for the
respective file type must be granted for the destination
directory. Otherwise, the operation results in an
<b>EACCES</b> error.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="22%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="74%">


<p>When renaming, the
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_</b><i>*</i> right for the
respective file type must be granted for the source
directory. Otherwise, the operation results in an
<b>EACCES</b> error.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If multiple
requirements are not met, the <b>EACCES</b> error code takes
precedence over <b>EXDEV</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Layers of
file path access rights</b> <br>
Each time a thread enforces a ruleset on itself, it updates
its Landlock domain with a new layer of policy. Indeed, this
complementary policy is composed with the potentially other
rulesets already restricting this thread. A sandboxed thread
can then safely add more constraints to itself with a new
enforced ruleset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One policy
layer grants access to a file path if at least one of its
rules encountered on the path grants the access. A sandboxed
thread can only access a file path if all its enforced
policy layers grant the access as well as all the other
system access controls (e.g., filesystem DAC, other LSM
policies, etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bind mounts
and OverlayFS</b> <br>
Landlock enables restricting access to file hierarchies,
which means that these access rights can be propagated with
bind mounts (cf. <b>mount_namespaces</b>(7)) but not with
OverlayFS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A bind mount
mirrors a source file hierarchy to a destination. The
destination hierarchy is then composed of the exact same
files, on which Landlock rules can be tied, either via the
source or the destination path. These rules restrict access
when they are encountered on a path, which means that they
can restrict access to multiple file hierarchies at the same
time, whether these hierarchies are the result of bind
mounts or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An OverlayFS
mount point consists of upper and lower layers. These layers
are combined in a merge directory, result of the mount
point. This merge hierarchy may include files from the upper
and lower layers, but modifications performed on the merge
hierarchy only reflect on the upper layer. From a Landlock
policy point of view, each of the OverlayFS layers and merge
hierarchies is standalone and contains its own set of files
and directories, which is different from a bind mount. A
policy restricting an OverlayFS layer will not restrict the
resulted merged hierarchy, and vice versa. Landlock users
should then only think about file hierarchies they want to
allow access to, regardless of the underlying
filesystem.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Inheritance</b>
<br>
Every new thread resulting from a <b>clone</b>(2) inherits
Landlock domain restrictions from its parent. This is
similar to the <b>seccomp</b>(2) inheritance or any other
LSM dealing with tasks&rsquo; <b>credentials</b>(7). For
instance, one process&rsquo;s thread may apply Landlock
rules to itself, but they will not be automatically applied
to other sibling threads (unlike POSIX thread credential
changes, cf. <b>nptl</b>(7)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a thread
sandboxes itself, we have the guarantee that the related
security policy will stay enforced on all this
thread&rsquo;s descendants. This allows creating standalone
and modular security policies per application, which will
automatically be composed between themselves according to
their runtime parent policies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ptrace
restrictions</b> <br>
A sandboxed process has less privileges than a non-sandboxed
process and must then be subject to additional restrictions
when manipulating another process. To be allowed to use
<b>ptrace</b>(2) and related syscalls on a target process, a
sandboxed process should have a subset of the target process
rules, which means the tracee must be in a sub-domain of the
tracer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Truncating
files</b> <br>
The operations covered by
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE</b> and
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE</b> both change the contents
of a file and sometimes overlap in non-intuitive ways. It is
recommended to always specify both of these together.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A particularly
surprising example is <b>creat</b>(2). The name suggests
that this system call requires the rights to create and
write files. However, it also requires the truncate right if
an existing file under the same name is already present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It should also
be noted that truncating files does not require the
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE</b> right. Apart from the
<b>truncate</b>(2) system call, this can also be done
through <b>open</b>(2) with the flags
<i>O_RDONLY&nbsp;|&nbsp;O_TRUNC</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When opening a
file, the availability of the
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE</b> right is associated with
the newly created file descriptor and will be used for
subsequent truncation attempts using <b>ftruncate</b>(2).
The behavior is similar to opening a file for reading or
writing, where permissions are checked during
<b>open</b>(2), but not during the subsequent <b>read</b>(2)
and <b>write</b>(2) calls.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a
consequence, it is possible to have multiple open file
descriptors for the same file, where one grants the right to
truncate the file and the other does not. It is also
possible to pass such file descriptors between processes,
keeping their Landlock properties, even when these processes
do not have an enforced Landlock ruleset.</p>

<h2>VERSIONS
<a name="VERSIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Landlock was
introduced in Linux 5.13.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To determine
which Landlock features are available, users should query
the Landlock ABI version:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-35873601.png" alt="Image grohtml-35873601.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Users should use the Landlock
ABI version rather than the kernel version to determine
which features are available. The mainline kernel versions
listed here are only included for orientation. Kernels from
other sources may contain backported features, and their
version numbers may not match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To query the
running kernel&rsquo;s Landlock ABI version, programs may
pass the <b>LANDLOCK_CREATE_RULESET_VERSION</b> flag to
<b>landlock_create_ruleset</b>(2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When building
fallback mechanisms for compatibility with older kernels,
users are advised to consider the special semantics of the
<b>LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER</b> access right: In ABI v1,
linking and moving of files between different directories is
always forbidden, so programs relying on such operations are
only compatible with Landlock ABI v2 and higher.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Landlock is
enabled by <b>CONFIG_SECURITY_LANDLOCK</b>. The
<i>lsm=lsm1,...,lsmN</i> command line parameter controls the
sequence of the initialization of Linux Security Modules. It
must contain the string <i>landlock</i> to enable Landlock.
If the command line parameter is not specified, the
initialization falls back to the value of the deprecated
<i>security=</i> command line parameter and further to the
value of <b>CONFIG_LSM</b>. We can check that Landlock is
enabled by looking for <i>landlock: Up and running.</i> in
kernel logs.</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is currently
not possible to restrict some file-related actions
accessible through these system call families:
<b>chdir</b>(2), <b>stat</b>(2), <b>flock</b>(2),
<b>chmod</b>(2), <b>chown</b>(2), <b>setxattr</b>(2),
<b>utime</b>(2), <b>ioctl</b>(2), <b>fcntl</b>(2),
<b>access</b>(2). Future Landlock evolutions will enable to
restrict them.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We first need
to create the ruleset that will contain our rules. For this
example, the ruleset will contain rules that only allow read
actions, but write actions will be denied. The ruleset then
needs to handle both of these kinds of actions. See below
for the description of filesystem actions.</p>

These threads are now in a new Landlock domain, merge of
their parent one (if any) with the new ruleset.</p>
