<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This service
calls <b>udevadm settle</b> to wait until all events that
have been queued by <b>udev</b>(7) have been processed. It
is a crude way to wait until &quot;all&quot; hardware has
been discovered. Services may pull in this service and order
themselves after it to wait for the udev queue to be
empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Using this
service is not recommended.</i> There can be no guarantee
that hardware is fully discovered at any specific time,
because the kernel does hardware detection asynchronously,
and certain buses and devices take a very long time to
become ready, and also additional hardware may be plugged in
at any time. Instead, services should subscribe to udev
events and react to any new hardware as it is discovered.
Services that, based on configuration, expect certain
devices to appear, may warn or report failure after a
timeout. This timeout should be tailored to the hardware
type. Waiting for systemd&minus;udev&minus;settle.service
usually slows boot significantly, because it means waiting
for all unrelated events too.</p>
