&minus; debuginfo-related http file-server daemon</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>debuginfod</b>
[<i>OPTION</i>]... [<i>PATH</i>]...</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>debuginfod</b>
serves debuginfo-related artifacts over HTTP. It
periodically scans a set of directories for ELF/DWARF files
and their associated source code, as well as archive files
containing the above, to build an index by their buildid.
This index is used when remote clients use the HTTP webapi,
to fetch these files by the same buildid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a debuginfod
cannot service a given buildid artifact request itself, and
it is configured with information about upstream debuginfod
servers, it queries them for the same information, just as
<b>debuginfod-find</b> would. If successful, it locally
caches then relays the file content to the original
requester.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Indexing the
given PATHs proceeds using multiple threads. One thread
periodically traverses all the given PATHs logically or
physically (see the <b>&minus;L</b> option). Duplicate PATHs
are ignored. You may use a file name for a PATH, but source
code indexing may be incomplete; prefer using a directory
that contains the binaries. The traversal thread enumerates
all matching files (see the <b>&minus;I</b> and
<b>&minus;X</b> options) into a work queue. A collection of
scanner threads (see the <b>&minus;c</b> option) wait at the
work queue to analyze files in parallel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
<b>&minus;F</b> option is given, each file is scanned as an
ELF/DWARF file. Source files are matched with DWARF files
based on the AT_comp_dir (compilation directory) attributes
inside it. Caution: source files listed in the DWARF may be
a path <i>anywhere</i> in the file system, and debuginfod
will readily serve their content on demand. (Imagine a
doctored DWARF file that lists <i>/etc/passwd</i> as a
source file.) If this is a concern, audit your binaries with
tools such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">% eu-readelf
-wline BINARY | sed -n
&rsquo;/^Directory.table/,/^File.name.table/p&rsquo; <br>
or <br>
% eu-readelf -wline BINARY | sed -n
&rsquo;/^Directory.table/,/^Line.number/p&rsquo; <br>
or even use debuginfod itself: <br>
% debuginfod -vvv -d :memory: -F BINARY 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep
&rsquo;recorded.*source&rsquo; <br>
^C</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If any of the
<b>&minus;R</b>, <b>-U</b>, or <b>-Z</b> options is given,
each file is scanned as an archive file that may contain
ELF/DWARF/source files. Archive files are recognized by
extension. If &minus;R is given, &quot;.rpm&quot; files are
scanned; if &minus;U is given, &quot;.deb&quot; and
&quot;.ddeb&quot; files are scanned; if &minus;Z is given,
the listed extensions are scanned. Because of complications
such as DWZ-compressed debuginfo, may require <i>two</i>
traversal passes to identify all source code. Source files
for RPMs are only served from other RPMs, so the caution for
&minus;F does not apply. Note that due to Debian/Ubuntu
packaging policies &amp; mechanisms, debuginfod cannot
resolve source files for DEB/DDEB at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no PATH is
listed, or none of the scanning options is given, then
<b>debuginfod</b> will simply serve content that it
accumulated into its index in all previous runs,
periodically groom the database, and federate to any
upstream debuginfod servers. In <i>passive</i> mode,
<b>debuginfod</b> will only serve content from a read-only
index and federated upstream servers, but will not scan or
groom.</p>

scanning. The default is off.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Z EXT &minus;Z
EXT=CMD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Activate an additional pattern
in archive scanning. Files with name extension EXT (include
the dot) will be processed. If CMD is given, it is invoked
with the file name added to its argument list, and should
produce a common archive on its standard output. Otherwise,
the file is read as if CMD were &quot;cat&quot;. Since
debuginfod internally uses <b>libarchive</b> to read archive
files, it can accept a wide range of archive formats and
compression modes. The default is no additional patterns.
This option may be repeated.</p>

libarchive can natively process RPM archives. If your
version of libarchive is much older than 2020, be aware that
some distributions have switched to an incompatible zstd
compression for their payload. You may experiment with
<b>&minus;Z&nbsp;.rpm=&rsquo;(rpm2cpio|zstdcat)&lt;&rsquo;</b>
instead of <b>&minus;R</b>.</p></td></tr>

<p><b>&minus;U</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Activate DEB/DDEB patterns in archive scanning. The
default is off. Equivalent to
<b>&minus;Z&nbsp;.deb=&rsquo;dpkg-deb&nbsp;&minus;&minus;fsys&minus;tarfile</b>&rsquo;

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;d FILE
&minus;&minus;database=FILE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the path of the sqlite
database used to store the index. This file is disposable in
the sense that a later rescan will repopulate data. It will
contain absolute file path names, so it may not be portable
across machines. It may be frequently read/written, so it
should be on a fast filesystem. It should not be shared
across machines or users, to maximize sqlite locking
performance. For quick testing the magic string
&quot;:memory:&quot; can be used to use an one-time
memory-only database. The default database file is
$HOME/.debuginfod.sqlite.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;passive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the server to passive mode,
where it only services webapi requests, including
participating in federation. It performs no scanning, no
grooming, and so only opens the sqlite database read-only.
This way a database can be safely shared between a active
scanner/groomer server and multiple passive ones, thereby
sharing service load. Archive pattern options must still be
given, so debuginfod can recognize file name extensions for
unpacking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;D SQL
&minus;&minus;ddl=SQL</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Execute given sqlite statement
after the database is opened and initialized as extra DDL
(SQL data definition language). This may be useful to tune
performance-related pragmas or indexes. May be repeated. The
default is nothing extra.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;p NUM
&minus;&minus;port=NUM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the TCP port number (0 &lt;
NUM &lt; 65536) on which debuginfod should listen, to
service HTTP requests. Both IPv4 and IPV6 sockets are
opened, if possible. The webapi is documented below. The
default port number is 8002.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I REGEX
&minus;&minus;include=REGEX &minus;X REGEX
&minus;&minus;exclude=REGEX</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Govern the inclusion and
exclusion of file names under the search paths. The regular
expressions are interpreted as unanchored POSIX extended
REs, thus may include alternation. They are evaluated
against the full path of each file, based on its
<b>realpath(3)</b> canonicalization. By default, all files
are included and none are excluded. A file that matches both
include and exclude REGEX is excluded. (The <i>contents</i>
of archive files are not subject to inclusion or exclusion
filtering: they are all processed.) Only the last of each
type of regular expression given is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;t SECONDS
&minus;&minus;rescan&minus;time=SECONDS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the rescan time for the
file and archive directories. This is the amount of time the
traversal thread will wait after finishing a scan, before
doing it again. A rescan for unchanged files is fast
(because the index also stores the file mtimes). A time of
zero is acceptable, and means that only one initial scan
should performed. The default rescan time is 300 seconds.
Receiving a SIGUSR1 signal triggers a new scan, independent
of the rescan time (including if it was zero), interrupting
a groom pass (if any).</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<p>Apply the -I and -X during groom cycles, so that files
excluded by the regexes are removed from the index. These
parameters are in addition to what normally qualifies a file
for grooming, not a replacement.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;g SECONDS
&minus;&minus;groom&minus;time=SECONDS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the groom time for the
index database. This is the amount of time the grooming
thread will wait after finishing a grooming pass before
doing it again. A groom operation quickly rescans all
previously scanned files, only to see if they are still
present and current, so it can deindex obsolete files. See
also the <i>DATA MANAGEMENT</i> section. The default groom
time is 86400 seconds (1 day). A time of zero is acceptable,
and means that only one initial groom should be performed.
Receiving a SIGUSR2 signal triggers a new grooming pass,
independent of the groom time (including if it was zero),
interrupting a rescan pass (if any)..</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;G</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Run an extraordinary maximal-grooming pass at debuginfod
startup. This pass can take considerable time, because it
tries to remove any debuginfo-unrelated content from the
archive-related parts of the index. It should not be run if
any recent archive-related indexing operations were aborted
early. It can take considerable space, because it finishes
up with an sqlite &quot;vacuum&quot; operation, which
repacks the database file by triplicating it temporarily.
The default is not to do maximal-grooming. See also the
<i>DATA MANAGEMENT</i> section.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;c NUM
&minus;&minus;concurrency=NUM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the concurrency limit for
the scanning queue threads, which work together to process
archives &amp; files located by the traversal thread. This
important for controlling CPU-intensive operations like
parsing an ELF file and especially decompressing archives.
The default is related to the number of processors on the
system and other constraints; the minimum is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C &minus;C=NUM
&minus;&minus;connection&minus;pool
&minus;&minus;connection&minus;pool=NUM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the size of the pool of

summarizes the interpretaton of this option and its optional
NUM parameter.</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-36045091.png" alt="Image grohtml-36045091.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The first mode

Caution: a loops in the symbolic directory tree might lead
to <i>infinite traversal</i>.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fdcache&minus;fds=NUM
&minus;&minus;fdcache&minus;mbs=MB</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Configure limits on a cache
that keeps recently extracted files from archives. Up to NUM
requested files and up to a total of MB megabytes will be
kept extracted, in order to avoid having to decompress their
archives over and over again. The default NUM and MB values
depend on the concurrency of the system, and on the
available disk space on the $TMPDIR or <b>/tmp</b>
filesystem. This is because that is where the most recently
used extracted files are kept. Grooming cleans out this
cache.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fdcache&minus;prefetch&minus;fds=NUM
&minus;&minus;fdcache&minus;prefetch&minus;mbs=MB</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fdcache&minus;prefetch=NUM2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the main fdcache, up to NUM2 other files from an archive may
be prefetched into another cache before they are even
requested. Configure how many file descriptors (fds) and
megabytes (mbs) are allocated to the prefetch fdcache. If
unspecified, these values depend on concurrency of the
system and on the available disk space on the $TMPDIR.
Allocating more to the prefetch cache will improve
performance in environments where different parts of several
large archives are being accessed. This cache is also
cleaned out during grooming.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fdcache&minus;mintmp=NUM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Configure a disk space
threshold for emergency flushing of the caches. The
filesystem holding the caches is checked periodically. If
the available space falls below the given percentage, the
caches are flushed, and the fdcaches will stay disabled
until the next groom cycle. This mechanism, along a few
associated /metrics on the webapi, are intended to give an
operator notice about storage scarcity - which can translate
to RAM scarcity if the disk happens to be on a RAM virtual
disk. The default threshold is 25%.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;forwarded&minus;ttl&minus;limit=NUM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Configure limits of
X-Forwarded-For hops. if X-Forwarded-For exceeds N hops, it
will not delegate a local lookup miss to upstream
debuginfods. The default limit is 8.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;disable&minus;source&minus;scan</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable scan of the dwarf
source info of debuginfo sections. If a setup has no access
to source code, the source info is not required.</p>

<h2>WEBAPI
<a name="WEBAPI"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">debuginfod&rsquo;s
webapi resembles ordinary file service, where a GET request
with a path containing a known buildid results in a file.
Unknown buildid / request combinations result in HTTP error
codes. This file service resemblance is intentional, so that
an installation can take advantage of standard HTTP
management infrastructure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Upon finding a
file in an archive or simply in the database, some custom
http headers are added to the response. For files in the
database X-DEBUGINFOD-FILE and X-DEBUGINFOD-SIZE are added.
X-DEBUGINFOD-FILE is simply the unescaped filename and
X-DEBUGINFOD-SIZE is the size of the file. For files found
in archives, in addition to X-DEBUGINFOD-FILE and
X-DEBUGINFOD-SIZE, X-DEBUGINFOD-ARCHIVE is added.
X-DEBUGINFOD-ARCHIVE is the name of the archive the file was
found in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
requests. In each case, the buildid is encoded as a
lowercase hexadecimal string. For example, for a program
<i>/bin/ls</i>, look at the ELF note GNU_BUILD_ID:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">% readelf -n
/bin/ls | grep -A4 build.id <br>
Note section [ 4] &rsquo;.note.gnu.buildid&rsquo; of 36
bytes at offset 0x340: <br>
Owner Data size Type <br>
GNU 20 GNU_BUILD_ID <br>
Build ID: 8713b9c3fb8a720137a4a08b325905c7aaf8429d</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then the
hexadecimal BUILDID is simply:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">8713b9c3fb8a720137a4a08b325905c7aaf8429d</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/buildid/</b><i>BUILDID</i><b>/debuginfo</b>
<br>
If the given buildid is known to the server, this request
will result in a binary object that contains the customary
<b>.*debug_*</b> sections. This may be a split debuginfo
file as created by <b>strip</b>, or it may be an original
unstripped executable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/buildid/</b><i>BUILDID</i><b>/executable</b>
<br>
If the given buildid is known to the server, this request
will result in a binary object that contains the normal
executable segments. This may be a executable stripped by
<b>strip</b>, or it may be an original unstripped
executable. <b>ET_DYN</b> shared libraries are considered to
be a type of executable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/buildid/</b><i>BUILDID</i><b>/source</b><i>/SOURCE/FILE</i>
<br>
If the given buildid is known to the server, this request
will result in a binary object that contains the source file
mentioned. The path should be absolute. Relative path names
commonly appear in the DWARF file&rsquo;s source directory,
but these paths are relative to individual compilation unit
AT_comp_dir paths, and yet an executable is made up of
multiple CUs. Therefore, to disambiguate, debuginfod expects
source queries to prefix relative path names with the CU
compilation-directory, followed by a mandatory
&quot;/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: the
caller may or may not elide <b>../</b> or <b>/./</b> or
extraneous <b>///</b> sorts of path components in the
directory names. debuginfod accepts both forms.
Specifically, debuginfod canonicalizes path names according
to RFC3986 section 5.2.4 (Remove Dot Segments), plus
reducing any <b>//</b> to <b>/</b> in the path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-36045092.png" alt="Image grohtml-36045092.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: the
client should %-escape characters in /SOURCE/FILE that are
not shown as &quot;unreserved&quot; in section 2.3 of
RFC3986. Some characters that will be escaped include
&quot;+&quot;, &quot;\&quot;, &quot;$&quot;, &quot;!&quot;,
the &rsquo;space&rsquo; character, and &quot;;&quot;.
RFC3986 includes a more comprehensive list of these
characters.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/buildid/</b><i>BUILDID</i><b>/section</b><i>/SECTION</i>
<br>
If the given buildid is known to the server, the server will
attempt to extract the contents of an ELF/DWARF section
named SECTION from the debuginfo file matching BUILDID. If
the debuginfo file can&rsquo;t be found or the section has
type SHT_NOBITS, then the server will attempt to extract the
section from the executable matching BUILDID. If the section
is successfully extracted then this request results in a
binary object of the section&rsquo;s contents. Note that
this result is the raw binary contents of the section, not
an ELF file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>/metrics</b>
<br>
This endpoint returns a Prometheus formatted text/plain dump
of a variety of statistics about the operation of the
debuginfod server. The exact set of metrics and their
meanings may change in future versions. Caution:
configuration information (path names, versions) may be
disclosed.</p>

<h2>DATA MANAGEMENT
<a name="DATA MANAGEMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">debuginfod
stores its index in an sqlite database in a densely packed
set of interlinked tables. While the representation is as
efficient as we have been able to make it, it still takes a
considerable amount of data to record all debuginfo-related
data of potentially a great many files. This section offers
some advice about the implications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a general
explanation for size, consider that debuginfod indexes
ELF/DWARF files, it stores their names and referenced source
file names, and buildids will be stored. When indexing
archives, it stores every file name <i>of or in</i> an
archive, every buildid, plus every source file name
referenced from a DWARF file. (Indexing archives takes more
space because the source files often reside in separate
subpackages that may not be indexed at the same pass, so
extra metadata has to be kept.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Getting down to
numbers, in the case of Fedora RPMs (essentially,
gzip-compressed cpio files), the sqlite index database tends
to be from 0.5% to 3% of their size. It&rsquo;s larger for
binaries that are assembled out of a great many source
files, or packages that carry much debuginfo-unrelated
content. It may be even larger during the indexing phase due
to temporary sqlite write-ahead-logging files; these are
checkpointed (cleaned out and removed) at shutdown. It may
be helpful to apply tight &minus;I or &minus;X
regular-expression constraints to exclude files from
scanning that you know have no debuginfo-relevant
content.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As debuginfod
runs in normal <i>active</i> mode, it periodically rescans
its target directories, and any new content found is added
to the database. Old content, such as data for files that
have disappeared or that have been replaced with newer
versions is removed at a periodic <i>grooming</i> pass. This
means that the sqlite files grow fast during initial
indexing, slowly during index rescans, and periodically
shrink during grooming. There is also an optional one-shot
<i>maximal grooming</i> pass is available. It removes
information debuginfo-unrelated data from the archive
content index such as file names found in archives
(&quot;archive sdef&quot; records) that are not referred to
as source files from any binaries find in archives
(&quot;archive sref&quot; records). This can save
considerable disk space. However, it is slow and temporarily
requires up to twice the database size as free space. Worse:
it may result in missing source-code info if the archive
traversals were interrupted, so that not all source file
references were known. Use it rarely to polish a complete
index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should
ensure that ample disk space remains available. (The flood
of error messages on -ENOSPC is ugly and nagging. But, like
for most other errors, debuginfod will resume when resources
permit.) If necessary, debuginfod can be stopped, the
database file moved or removed, and debuginfod
restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sqlite offers
several performance-related options in the form of pragmas.
Some may be useful to fine-tune the defaults plus the
debuginfod extras. The &minus;D option may be useful to tell
debuginfod to execute the given bits of SQL after the basic
schema creation commands. For example, the
&quot;synchronous&quot;, &quot;cache_size&quot;,
&quot;auto_vacuum&quot;, &quot;threads&quot;,
&quot;journal_mode&quot; pragmas may be fun to tweak via
&minus;D, if you&rsquo;re searching for peak performance.
The &quot;optimize&quot;, &quot;wal_checkpoint&quot; pragmas
may be useful to run periodically, outside debuginfod. The
default settings are performance- rather than
reliability-oriented, so a hardware crash might corrupt the
database. In these cases, it may be necessary to manually
delete the sqlite database and start over.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As debuginfod
changes in the future, we may have no choice but to change
the database schema in an incompatible manner. If this
happens, new versions of debuginfod will issue SQL
statements to <i>drop</i> all prior schema &amp; data, and
start over. So, disk space will not be wasted for retaining
a no-longer-useable dataset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In summary, if
your system can bear a 0.5%-3% index-to-archive-dataset size
ratio, and slow growth afterwards, you should not need to
worry about disk space. If a system crash corrupts the
database, or you want to force debuginfod to reset and start
over, simply erase the sqlite file before restarting
debuginfod.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In contrast, in
<i>passive</i> mode, all scanning and grooming is disabled,
and the index database remains read-only. This makes the
database more suitable for sharing between servers or sites
with simple one-way replication, and data management
considerations are generally moot.</p>

<h2>SECURITY
<a name="SECURITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">debuginfod
<b>does not</b> include any particular security features.
While it is robust with respect to inputs, some abuse is
possible. It forks a new thread for each incoming HTTP
request, which could lead to a denial-of-service in terms of
RAM, CPU, disk I/O, or network I/O. If this is a problem,
users are advised to install debuginfod with a HTTPS
reverse-proxy front-end that enforces site policies for
firewalling, authentication, integrity, authorization, and
load control. The <i>/metrics</i> webapi endpoint is
probably not appropriate for disclosure to the public.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When relaying
queries to upstream debuginfods, debuginfod <b>does not</b>
include any particular security features. It trusts that the
binaries returned by the debuginfods are accurate.
Therefore, the list of servers should include only
trustworthy ones. If accessed across HTTP rather than HTTPS,
the network should be trustworthy. Authentication
information through the internal <i>libcurl</i> library is
not currently enabled.</p>
