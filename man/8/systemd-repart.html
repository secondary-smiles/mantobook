<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd&minus;repart</b>
grows and adds partitions to a partition table, based on the
configuration files described in <b>repart.d</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If invoked with
no arguments, it operates on the block device backing the
root file system partition of the running OS, thus growing
and adding partitions of the booted OS image itself. If
<i>&minus;&minus;image=</i> is used it will operate on the
specified image file. When called in the initrd it operates
on the block device backing /sysroot/ instead, i.e. on the
block device the system will soon transition into. The
systemd&minus;repart.service service is generally run at
boot in the initrd, in order to augment the partition table
of the OS before its partitions are mounted.
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b> (mostly) operates in a purely
incremental mode: it only grows existing and adds new
partitions; it does not shrink, delete or move existing
partitions. The service is intended to be run on every boot,
but when it detects that the partition table already matches
the installed repart.d/*.conf configuration files, it
executes no operation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd&minus;repart</b>
is intended to be used when deploying OS images, to
automatically adjust them to the system they are running on,
during first boot. This way the deployed image can be
minimal in size and may be augmented automatically at boot
when needed, taking possession of disk space available but
not yet used. Specifically the following use cases are among
those covered:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The root
partition may be grown to cover the whole available disk
space.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A
/home/, swap or /srv/ partition can be added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A second
(or third, ...) root partition may be added, to cover A/B
style setups where a second version of the root file system
is alternatingly used for implementing update schemes. The
deployed image would carry only a single partition
(&quot;A&quot;) but on first boot a second partition
(&quot;B&quot;) for this purpose is automatically
created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The algorithm
executed by <b>systemd&minus;repart</b> is roughly as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. The
repart.d/*.conf configuration files are loaded and parsed,
and ordered by filename (without the directory prefix). For
each configuration file, drop&minus;in files are looked for
in directories with same name as the configuration file with
a suffix &quot;.d&quot; added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. The
partition table already existing on the block device is
loaded and parsed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. The existing
partitions in the partition table are matched up with the
repart.d/*.conf files by GPT partition type UUID. The first
existing partition of a specific type is assigned the first
configuration file declaring the same type. The second
existing partition of a specific type is then assigned the
second configuration file declaring the same type, and so
on. After this iterative assigning is complete any
left&minus;over existing partitions that have no matching
configuration file are considered &quot;foreign&quot; and
left as they are. And any configuration files for which no
partition currently exists are understood as a request to
create such a partition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. Taking the
size constraints and weights declared in the configuration
files into account, all partitions that shall be created are
now allocated to the disk, taking up all free space, always
respecting the size and padding requests. Similarly,
existing partitions that should be grown are grown. New
partitions are always appended to the end of the partition
table, taking the first partition table slot whose index is
greater than the indexes of all existing partitions.
Partition table slots are never reordered and thus partition
numbers are ensured to remain stable. Note that this
allocation happens in memory only, the partition table on
disk is not updated yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. All existing
partitions for which configuration files exist and which
currently have no GPT partition label set will be assigned a
label, either explicitly configured in the configuration or
&mdash; if that's missing &mdash; derived automatically from
the partition type. The same is done for all partitions that
are newly created. These assignments are done in memory
only, too, the disk is not updated yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">6. Similarly,
all existing partitions for which configuration files exist
and which currently have an all&minus;zero identifying UUID
will be assigned a new UUID. This UUID is cryptographically
hashed from a common seed value together with the partition
type UUID (and a counter in case multiple partitions of the
same type are defined), see below. The same is done for all
partitions that are created anew. These assignments are done
in memory only, too, the disk is not updated yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">7. Similarly,
if the disk's volume UUID is all zeroes it is also
initialized, also cryptographically hashed from the same
common seed value. This is done in memory only too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">8. The disk
space assigned to new partitions (i.e. what was previously
free space) is now erased. Specifically, all file system
signatures are removed, and if the device supports it, the
<b>BLKDISCARD</b> I/O control command is issued to inform
the hardware that the space is now empty. In addition any
&quot;padding&quot; between partitions and at the end of the
device is similarly erased.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">9. The new
partition table is finally written to disk. The kernel is
asked to reread the partition table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As exception to
the normally strictly incremental operation, when called in
a special &quot;factory reset&quot; mode,
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b> may also be used to erase
existing partitions to reset an installation back to vendor
defaults. This mode of operation is used when either the
<b>&minus;&minus;factory&minus;reset=yes</b> switch is
passed on the tool's command line, or the
<b>systemd.factory_reset=yes</b> option specified on the
kernel command line, or the <i>FactoryReset</i> EFI variable
(vendor UUID
<b>8cf2644b&minus;4b0b&minus;428f&minus;9387&minus;6d876050dc67</b>)
is set to &quot;yes&quot;. It alters the algorithm above
slightly: between the 3rd and the 4th step above any
partition marked explicitly via the <i>FactoryReset=</i>
boolean is deleted, and the algorithm restarted, thus
immediately re&minus;creating these partitions anew
empty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b> only changes partition tables,
it does not create or resize any file systems within these
partitions. A separate mechanism should be used for that,
for example <b>systemd-growfs</b>(8) and
<b>systemd&minus;makefs</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The UUIDs
identifying the new partitions created (or assigned to
existing partitions that have no UUID yet), as well as the
disk as a whole are hashed cryptographically from a common
seed value. This seed value is usually the
<b>machine-id</b>(5) of the system, so that the machine ID
reproducibly determines the UUIDs assigned to all
partitions. If the machine ID cannot be read (or the user
passes <b>&minus;&minus;seed=random</b>, see below) the seed
is generated randomly instead, so that the partition UUIDs
are also effectively random. The seed value may also be set
explicitly, formatted as UUID via the
<b>&minus;&minus;seed=</b> option. By hashing these UUIDs
from a common seed images prepared with this tool become
reproducible and the result of the algorithm above
deterministic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The positional
argument should specify the block device to operate on.
Instead of a block device node path a regular file may be
specified too, in which case the command operates on it like
it would if a loopback block device node was specified with
the file attached. If <b>&minus;&minus;empty=create</b> is
specified the specified path is created as regular file,
which is useful for generating disk images from scratch.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are understood:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean. If this switch
is not specified <b>&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run=yes</b> is
the implied default. Controls whether systemd&minus;repart
executes the requested re&minus;partition operations or
whether it should only show what it would do. Unless
<b>&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run=no</b> is specified
systemd&minus;repart will not actually touch the device's
partition table.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;empty=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes one of
&quot;refuse&quot;, &quot;allow&quot;, &quot;require&quot;,
&quot;force&quot; or &quot;create&quot;. Controls how to
operate on block devices that are entirely empty, i.e. carry
no partition table/disk label yet. If this switch is not
specified the implied default is &quot;refuse&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;refuse&quot; <b>systemd&minus;repart</b> requires that
the block device it shall operate on already carries a
partition table and refuses operation if none is found. If
&quot;allow&quot; the command will extend an existing
partition table or create a new one if none exists. If
&quot;require&quot; the command will create a new partition
table if none exists so far, and refuse operation if one
already exists. If &quot;force&quot; it will create a fresh
partition table unconditionally, erasing the disk fully in
effect. If &quot;force&quot; no existing partitions will be
taken into account or survive the operation. Hence: use with
care, this is a great way to lose all your data. If
&quot;create&quot; a new loopback file is create under the
path passed via the device node parameter, of the size
indicated with <b>&minus;&minus;size=</b>, see below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;discard=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean. If this switch
is not specified <b>&minus;&minus;discard=yes</b> is the
implied default. Controls whether to issue the
<b>BLKDISCARD</b> I/O control command on the space taken up
by any added partitions or on the space in between them.
Usually, it's a good idea to issue this request since it
tells the underlying hardware that the covered blocks shall
be considered empty, improving performance. If operating on
a regular file instead of a block device node, a sparse file
is generated.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;size=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a size in bytes, using
the usual K, M, G, T suffixes, or the special value
&quot;auto&quot;. If used the specified device node path
must refer to a regular file, which is then grown to the
specified size if smaller, before any change is made to the
partition table. If specified as &quot;auto&quot; the
minimal size for the disk image is automatically determined
(i.e. the minimal sizes of all partitions are summed up,
taking space for additional metadata into account). This
switch is not supported if the specified node is a block
device. This switch has no effect if the file is already as
large as the specified size or larger. The specified size is
implicitly rounded up to multiples of 4096. When used with
<b>&minus;&minus;empty=create</b> this specifies the initial
size of the loopback file to create.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;&minus;size=auto</b> option takes the sizes of
pre&minus;existing partitions into account. However, it does
not accommodate for partition tables that are not tightly
packed: the configured partitions might still not fit into
the backing device if empty space exists between
pre&minus;existing partitions (or before the first
partition) that cannot be fully filled by partitions to grow
or create.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also note that
the automatic size determination does not take files or
directories specified with <b>CopyFiles=</b> into account:
operation might fail if the specified files or directories
require more disk space then the configured
per&minus;partition minimal size limit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;factory&minus;reset=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes boolean. If this switch
is not specified <b>&minus;&minus;factory=reset=no</b> is
the implied default. Controls whether to operate in
&quot;factory reset&quot; mode, see above. If set to true
this will remove all existing partitions marked with
<i>FactoryReset=</i> set to yes early while executing the
re&minus;partitioning algorithm. Use with care, this is a
great way to lose all your data. Note that partition files
need to explicitly turn <i>FactoryReset=</i> on, as the
option defaults to off. If no partitions are marked for
factory reset this switch has no effect. Note that there are
two other methods to request factory reset operation: via
the kernel command line and via an EFI variable, see
above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;can&minus;factory&minus;reset</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this switch is specified the
disk is not re&minus;partitioned. Instead it is determined
if any existing partitions are marked with
<i>FactoryReset=</i>. If there are the tool will exit with
exit status zero, otherwise non&minus;zero. This switch may
be used to quickly determine whether the running system
supports a factory reset mechanism built on
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;root=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a path to a directory to
use as root file system when searching for repart.d/*.conf
files, for the machine ID file to use as seed and for the
<i>CopyFiles=</i> and <i>CopyBlocks=</i> source files and
directories. By default when invoked on the regular system
this defaults to the host's root file system /. If invoked
from the initrd this defaults to /sysroot/, so that the tool
operates on the configuration and machine ID stored in the
root file system later transitioned into itself.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;image=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a path to a disk image
file or device to mount and use in a similar fashion to
<b>&minus;&minus;root=</b>, see above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;seed=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a UUID as argument or the
special value <b>random</b>. If a UUID is specified the
UUIDs to assign to partitions and the partition table itself
are derived via cryptographic hashing from it. If not
specified it is attempted to read the machine ID from the
host (or more precisely, the root directory configured via
<b>&minus;&minus;root=</b>) and use it as seed instead,
falling back to a randomized seed otherwise. Use
<b>&minus;&minus;seed=random</b> to force a randomized seed.
Explicitly specifying the seed may be used to generated
strictly reproducible partition tables.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;pretty=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. If
this switch is not specified, it defaults to on when called
from an interactive terminal and off otherwise. Controls
whether to show a user friendly table and graphic
illustrating the changes applied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;definitions=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a file system path. If
specified the *.conf files are read from the specified
directory instead of searching in /usr/lib/repart.d/*.conf,
/etc/repart.d/*.conf, /run/repart.d/*.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This parameter
can be specified multiple times.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;key&minus;file=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a file system path.
Configures the encryption key to use when setting up LUKS2
volumes configured with the <i>Encrypt=key&minus;file</i>
setting in partition files. Should refer to a regular file
containing the key, or an <b>AF_UNIX</b> stream socket in
the file system. In the latter case a connection is made to
it and the key read from it. If this switch is not specified
the empty key (i.e. zero length key) is used. This behaviour
is useful for setting up encrypted partitions during early
first boot that receive their user&minus;supplied password
only in a later setup step.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;private&minus;key=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a file system path.
Configures the signing key to use when creating verity
signature partitions with the <i>Verity=signature</i>
setting in partition files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;certificate=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a file system path.
Configures the PEM encoded X.509 certificate to use when
creating verity signature partitions with the
<i>Verity=signature</i> setting in partition files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;device=</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;pcrs=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Configures the TPM2 device and
list of PCRs to use for LUKS2 volumes configured with the
<i>Encrypt=tpm2</i> option. These options take the same
parameters as the identically named options to
<b>systemd-cryptenroll</b>(1) and have the same effect on
partitions where TPM2 enrollment is requested.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;public&minus;key=</b>
[PATH],
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;public&minus;key&minus;pcrs=</b>
[PCR...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Configures a TPM2 signed PCR
policy to bind encryption to. See
<b>systemd-cryptenroll</b>(1) for details on these two
options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;split=</b>
[BOOL]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enables generation of split
artifacts from partitions configured with <i>SplitName=</i>.
If enabled, for each partition with <i>SplitName=</i> set, a
separate output file containing just the contents of that
partition is generated. The output filename consists of the
loopback filename suffixed with the name configured with
<i>SplitName=</i>. If the loopback filename ends with
&quot;.raw&quot;, the suffix is inserted before the
&quot;.raw&quot; extension instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<b>&minus;&minus;split</b> is independent from
<b>&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run</b>. Even if
<b>&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run</b> is enabled, split
artifacts will still be generated from an existing image if
<b>&minus;&minus;split</b> is enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;include&minus;partitions=</b>
[PARTITION...],
<b>&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;partitions=</b>
[PARTITION...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These options specify which
partition types <b>systemd&minus;repart</b> should operate
on. If <b>&minus;&minus;include&minus;partitions=</b> is
used, all partitions that aren't specified are excluded. If
<b>&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;partitions=</b> is used, all
partitions that are specified are excluded. Both options
take a comma separated list of GPT partition type UUIDs or
identifiers (see <i>Type=</i> in <b>repart.d</b>(5)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;defer&minus;partitions=</b>
[PARTITION...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option specifies for which
partition types <b>systemd&minus;repart</b> should defer.
All partitions that are deferred using this option are still
taken into account when calculating the sizes and offsets of
other partitions, but aren't actually written to the disk
image. The net effect of this option is that if you run
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b> again without these options, the
missing partitions will be added as if they had not been
deferred the first time <b>systemd&minus;repart</b> was
executed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;sector&minus;size=</b>
[BYTES]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option allows configuring
the sector size of the image produced by
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b>. It takes a value that is a
power of &quot;2&quot; between &quot;512&quot; and
&quot;4096&quot;. This option is useful when building images
for disks that use a different sector size as the disk on
which the image is produced. . <br>
.RE</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;h</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Print a short help text and
exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Print a short version string
and exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;pager</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Do not pipe output into a
pager.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;legend</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Do not print the legend, i.e.
column headers and the footer with hints.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;json=</b><i>MODE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Shows output formatted as JSON.
Expects one of &quot;short&quot; (for the shortest possible
output without any redundant whitespace or line breaks),
&quot;pretty&quot; (for a pretty version of the same, with
indentation and line breaks) or &quot;off&quot; (to turn off
JSON output, the default).</p>
