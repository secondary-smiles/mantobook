<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
NetworkManager daemon attempts to make networking
configuration and operation as painless and automatic as
possible by managing the primary network connection and
other network interfaces, like Ethernet, Wi&minus;Fi, and
Mobile Broadband devices. NetworkManager will connect any
network device when a connection for that device becomes
available, unless that behavior is disabled. Information
about networking is exported via a D&minus;Bus interface to
any interested application, providing a rich API with which
to inspect and control network settings and operation.</p>

<h2>DISPATCHER SCRIPTS
<a name="DISPATCHER SCRIPTS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NetworkManager&minus;dispatcher
service can execute scripts for the user in response to
network events. See <b>NetworkManager-dispatcher</b>(8)
manual.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are understood:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;version</b>
| <b>&minus;V</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print the NetworkManager
software version and exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;help</b>
| <b>&minus;h</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print NetworkManager's
available options and exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;daemon</b>
| <b>&minus;n</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not daemonize.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;debug</b>
| <b>&minus;d</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not daemonize, and direct
log output to the controlling terminal in addition to
syslog.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;pid&minus;file</b>
| <b>&minus;p</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify location of a PID file.
The PID file is used for storing PID of the running process
and prevents running multiple instances.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;state&minus;file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify file for storing state
of the NetworkManager persistently. If not specified, the
default value of
/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.state is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;config</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify configuration file to
set up various settings for NetworkManager. If not
specified, the default value of
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf is used with a
fallback to the older 'nm&minus;system&minus;settings.conf'
if located in the same directory. See
<b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5) for more information on
configuration file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;configure&minus;and&minus;quit</b>
[initrd]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Quit after all devices reach a
stable state. The optional initrd parameter enables mode,
where no processes are left running after NetworkManager
stops, which is useful for running from an initial ramdisk
on rearly boot.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;plugins</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List plugins used to manage
system&minus;wide connection settings. This list has
preference over plugins specified in the configuration file.
See main.plugins setting in <b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5)
for supported options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;log&minus;level</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets how much information
NetworkManager sends to the log destination (usually
syslog's &quot;daemon&quot; facility). By default, only
informational, warning, and error messages are logged. See
the section on logging in <b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5) for
more information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;log&minus;domains</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A comma&minus;separated list
specifying which operations are logged to the log
destination (usually syslog). By default, most domains are
logging&minus;enabled. See the section on logging in
<b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5) for more information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;print&minus;config</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print the NetworkManager
configuration to stdout and exit. See
<b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5). This does not include
connection profiles. View them with <b>nmcli
connection</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This reads
configuration files from disk. If NetworkManager is
currently running, make sure that it has the same
configuration loaded.</p>

<h2>UDEV PROPERTIES
<a name="UDEV PROPERTIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>udev</b>(7)
device manager is used for the network device discovery. The
following property influences how NetworkManager manages the
devices:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>NM_UNMANAGED</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If set to &quot;1&quot; or
&quot;true&quot;, the device is configured as unmanaged by
NetworkManager. Note that the user still can explicitly
overrule this configuration via means like <b>nmcli device
set &quot;$DEVICE&quot; managed yes</b> or
&quot;device*.managed=1&quot; in NetworkManager.conf.</p>

<h2>SIGNALS
<a name="SIGNALS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NetworkManager
process handles the following signals:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>SIGHUP</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The signal causes a reload of
NetworkManager's configuration. Note that not all
configuration parameters can be changed at runtime and
therefore some changes may be applied only after the next
restart of the daemon. A SIGHUP also involves further
reloading actions, like doing a DNS update and restarting
the DNS plugin. The latter can be useful for example when
using the dnsmasq plugin and changing its configuration in
/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d. However, it also means this
will shortly interrupt name resolution. In the future, there
may be further actions added. A SIGHUP means to update
NetworkManager configuration and reload everything that is
supported. Note that this does not reload connections from
disk. For that there is a D&minus;Bus API and nmcli's reload
action</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>SIGUSR1</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The signal forces a rewrite of
DNS configuration. Contrary to SIGHUP, this does not restart
the DNS plugin and will not interrupt name resolution. When
NetworkManager is not managing DNS, the signal forces a
restart of operations that depend on the DNS configuration
(like the resolution of the system hostname via reverse DNS,
or the resolution of WireGuard peers); therefore, it can be
used to tell NetworkManager that the content of resolv.conf
was changed externally. In the future, further actions may
be added. A SIGUSR1 means to write out data like
resolv.conf, or refresh a cache. It is a subset of what is
done for SIGHUP without reloading configuration from
disk.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>SIGUSR2</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The signal has no effect at the
moment but is reserved for future use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
to a signal to reload configuration is the Reload
D&minus;Bus call. It allows for more fine&minus;grained
selection of what to reload, it only returns after the
reload is complete, and it is guarded by PolicyKit.</p>

<h2>DEBUGGING
<a name="DEBUGGING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NetworkManager
only configures your system. So when your networking setup
doesn't work as expected, the first step is to look at your
system to understand what is actually configured, and
whether that is correct. The second step is to find out how
to tell NetworkManager to do the right thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can for
example try to <b>ping</b> hosts (by IP address or DNS
name), look at <b>ip link show</b>, <b>ip address show</b>
and <b>ip route show</b>, and look at /etc/resolv.conf for
name resolution issues. Also look at the connection profiles
that you have configured in NetworkManager (<b>nmcli
connection</b> and <b>nmcli connection show
&quot;$PROFILE&quot;</b>) and the configured interfaces
(<b>nmcli device</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If that does
not suffice, look at the logfiles of NetworkManager.
NetworkManager logs to syslog, so depending on your system
configuration you can call <b>journalctl</b> to get the
logs. By default, NetworkManager logs are not verbose and
thus not very helpful for investigating a problem in detail.
You can change the logging level at runtime with <b>nmcli
general logging level TRACE domains ALL</b>. But usually a
better way is to collect full logs from the start, by
configuring level=TRACE in NetworkManager.conf. See
<b>NetworkManager.conf</b>(5) manual. Note that trace logs
of NetworkManager are verbose and systemd&minus;journald
might rate limit some lines. Possibly disable rate limiting
first with the RateLimitIntervalSec and RateLimitBurst
options of journald (see <b>journald.conf</b>(5)
manual).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NetworkManager
does not log any secrets. However, you are advised to check
whether anything private sensitive gets logged before
posting. When reporting an issue, provide complete logs and
avoid modifications (for privacy) that distort the
meaning.</p>

<h2>/VAR/LIB/NETWORKMANAGER/SECRET_KEY AND /ETC/MACHINE&minus;ID
<a name="/VAR/LIB/NETWORKMANAGER/SECRET_KEY AND /ETC/MACHINE&minus;ID"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The identity of
a machine is important as various settings depend on it. For
example, ipv6.addr&minus;gen&minus;mode=stable and
ethernet.cloned&minus;mac&minus;address=stable generate
identifiers by hashing the machine's identity. See also the
connection.stable&minus;id connection property which is a
per&minus;profile seed that gets hashed with the machine
identity for generating such addresses and identifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you backup
and restore a machine, the identity of the machine probably
should be preserved. In that case, preserve the files
/var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key and
/etc/machine&minus;id. On the other hand, if you clone a
virtual machine, you probably want that the clone has a
different identity. There is already existing tooling on
Linux for handling /etc/machine&minus;id (see
<b>machine-id</b>(5)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The identity of
the machine is determined by the
/var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key. If such a file does not
exist, NetworkManager will create a file with random
content. To generate a new identity just delete the file and
after restart a new file will be created. The file should be
read&minus;only to root and contain at least 16 bytes that
will be used to seed the various places where a stable
identifier is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since 1.16.0,
NetworkManager supports a version 2 of secret&minus;keys.
For such keys /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key starts with
ASCII &quot;nm&minus;v2:&quot; followed by at least 32 bytes
of random data. Also, recent versions of NetworkManager
always create such kinds of secret&minus;keys, when the file
does not yet exist. With version 2 of the secret&minus;key,
/etc/machine&minus;id is also hashed as part of the
generation for addresses and identifiers. The advantage is
that you can keep /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key stable,
and only regenerate /etc/machine&minus;id when cloning a
VM.</p>
