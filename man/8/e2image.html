<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>e2image</b> program will save critical ext2, ext3, or
ext4 file system metadata located on <i>device</i> to a file
specified by <i>image-file</i>. The image file may be
examined by <b>dumpe2fs</b> and <b>debugfs</b>, by using the
<b>&minus;i</b> option to those programs. This can assist an
expert in recovering catastrophically corrupted file
systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is a very
good idea to create image files for all file systems on a
system and save the partition layout (which can be generated
using the <b>fdisk &minus;l</b> command) at regular
intervals --- at boot time, and/or every week or so. The
image file should be stored on some file system other than
the file system whose data it contains, to ensure that this
data is accessible in the case where the file system has
been badly damaged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To save disk
space, <b>e2image</b> creates the image file as a sparse
file, or in QCOW2 format. Hence, if the sparse image file
needs to be copied to another location, it should either be
compressed first or copied using the
<b>&minus;&minus;sparse=always</b> option to the GNU version
of <b>cp</b>(1). This does not apply to the QCOW2 image,
which is not sparse.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The size of an
ext2 image file depends primarily on the size of the file
systems and how many inodes are in use. For a typical 10
Gigabyte file system, with 200,000 inodes in use out of 1.2
million inodes, the image file will be approximately 35
Megabytes; a 4 Gigabyte file system with 15,000 inodes in
use out of 550,000 inodes will result in a 3 Megabyte image
file. Image files tend to be quite compressible; an image
file taking up 32 Megabytes of space on disk will generally
compress down to 3 or 4 Megabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<i>image-file</i> is <b>&minus;</b>, then the output of
<b>e2image</b> will be sent to standard output, so that the
output can be piped to another program, such as
<b>gzip</b>(1). (Note that this is currently only supported
when creating a raw image file using the <b>&minus;r</b>
option, since the process of creating a normal image file,
or QCOW2 image currently requires random access to the file,
which cannot be done using a pipe.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Include file data in the image
file. Normally <b>e2image</b> only includes fs metadata, not
regular file data. This option will produce an image that is
suitable to use to clone the entire FS or for backup
purposes. Note that this option only works with the raw
(<i>&minus;r</i>) or QCOW2 (<i>&minus;Q</i>) formats. In
conjunction with the <b>&minus;r</b> option it is possible
to clone all and only the used blocks of one file system to
another device/image file.</p></td></tr>

<i>superblock</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Get image from partition with
broken primary superblock by using the superblock located at
file system block number <i>superblock</i>. The partition is
copied as-is including broken primary superblock.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;B</b>
<i>blocksize</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the file system blocksize
in bytes. Normally, <b>e2image</b> will search for the
superblock at various different block sizes in an attempt to
find the appropriate blocksize. This search can be fooled in
some cases. This option forces e2fsck to only try locating
the superblock with a particular blocksize. If the
superblock is not found, e2image will terminate with a fatal
error.</p>

<p>Compare each block to be copied from the source
<i>device</i> to the corresponding block in the target
<i>image-file</i>. If both are already the same, the write

cloned to a flash-based storage device (where reads are very
fast and where it is desirable to avoid unnecessary writes
to reduce write wear on the device).</p></td></tr>

system when saving the image file using the <b>&minus;r</b>
and <b>&minus;Q</b> options. Normally, if the source file
system is in use, the resulting image file is very likely
not going to be useful. In some cases where the source file
system is in constant use this may be better than no image

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>WARNING!!!!</b>
The <b>&minus;I</b> option should only be used as a
desperation measure when other alternatives have failed. If
the file system has changed since the image file was
created, data <b>will</b> be lost. In general, you should
make another full image backup of the file system first, in
case you wish to try other recovery strategies
afterward.</p>

<h2>RAW IMAGE FILES
<a name="RAW IMAGE FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;r</b> option will create a raw image file, which
differs from a normal image file in two ways. First, the
file system metadata is placed in the same relative offset
within <i>image-file</i> as it is in the <i>device</i> so
that <b>debugfs</b>(8), <b>dumpe2fs</b>(8),
<b>e2fsck</b>(8), <b>losetup</b>(8), etc. and can be run
directly on the raw image file. In order to minimize the
amount of disk space consumed by the raw image file, it is
created as a sparse file. (Beware of copying or
compressing/decompressing this file with utilities that
don&rsquo;t understand how to create sparse files; the file
will become as large as the file system itself!) Secondly,
the raw image file also includes indirect blocks and
directory blocks, which the standard image file does not
have.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Raw image files
are sometimes used when sending file systems to the
maintainer as part of bug reports to e2fsprogs. When used in
this capacity, the recommended command is as follows
(replace <b>hda1</b> with the appropriate device for your
system):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>e2image
&minus;r /dev/hda1 &minus; | bzip2 &gt; hda1.e2i.bz2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will only
send the metadata information, without any data blocks.
However, the filenames in the directory blocks can still
reveal information about the contents of the file system
that the bug reporter may wish to keep confidential. To
address this concern, the <b>&minus;s</b> option can be
specified to scramble the filenames in the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
will work even if you substitute <b>/dev/hda1</b> for
another raw disk image, or QCOW2 image previously created by
<b>e2image</b>.</p>

<h2>QCOW2 IMAGE FILES
<a name="QCOW2 IMAGE FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;Q</b> option will create a QCOW2 image file
instead of a normal, or raw image file. A QCOW2 image
contains all the information the raw image does, however
unlike the raw image it is not sparse. The QCOW2 image
minimize the amount of space used by the image by storing it
in special format which packs data closely together, hence
avoiding holes while still minimizing size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
send file system to the maintainer as a part of bug report
to e2fsprogs, use following commands (replace <b>hda1</b>
with the appropriate device for your system):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>e2image
&minus;Q /dev/hda1 hda1.qcow2 <br>
bzip2 -z hda1.qcow2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will only
send the metadata information, without any data blocks. As
described for <b>RAW IMAGE FILES</b> the <b>&minus;s</b>
option can be specified to scramble the file system names in
the image.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
QCOW2 image created by <b>e2image</b> is a regular QCOW2
image and can be processed by tools aware of QCOW2 format
such as for example <b>qemu-img</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can convert
a .qcow2 image into a raw image with:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>e2image
&minus;r hda1.qcow2 hda1.raw</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
useful to write a QCOW2 image containing all data to a
sparse image file where it can be loop mounted, or to a disk
partition. Note that this may not work with QCOW2 images not
generated by e2image.</p>

<h2>OFFSETS
<a name="OFFSETS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally a file
system starts at the beginning of a partition, and
<b>e2image</b> is run on the partition. When working with
image files, you don&rsquo;t have the option of using the
partition device, so you can specify the offset where the
file system starts directly with the <b>&minus;o</b> option.
Similarly the <b>&minus;O</b> option specifies the offset
that should be seeked to in the destination before writing
the file system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you have a <b>dd</b> image of a whole hard drive that
contains an ext2 fs in a partition starting at 1 MiB, you
can clone that image to a block device with:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>e2image
&minus;aro 1048576 img /dev/sda1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or you can
clone a file system from a block device into an image file,
leaving room in the first MiB for a partition table
with:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>e2image -arO
1048576 /dev/sda1 img</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you specify
at least one offset, and only one file, an in-place move
will be performed, allowing you to safely move the file
system from one offset to another.</p>
