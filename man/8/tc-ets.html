<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Enhanced
Transmission Selection scheduler is a classful queuing
discipline that merges functionality of PRIO and DRR qdiscs
in one scheduler. ETS makes it easy to configure a set of
strict and bandwidth-sharing bands to implement the
transmission selection described in 802.1Qaz.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On creation
with &rsquo;tc qdisc add&rsquo;, a fixed number of bands is
created. Each band is a class, although it is not possible
to directly add and remove bands with &rsquo;tc class&rsquo;
commands. The number of bands to be created must instead be
specified on the command line as the qdisc is added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The minor
number of classid to use when referring to a band is the
band number increased by one. Thus band 0 will have classid
of major:1, band 1 that of major:2, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ETS bands are
of two types: some number may be in strict mode, the
remaining ones are in bandwidth-sharing mode.</p>

<h2>ALGORITHM
<a name="ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When dequeuing,
strict bands are tried first, if there are any. Band 0 is
tried first. If it did not deliver a packet, band 1 is tried
next, and so on until one of the bands delivers a packet, or
the strict bands are exhausted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no packet
has been dequeued from any of the strict bands, if there are
any bandwidth-sharing bands, the dequeuing proceeds
according to the DRR algorithm. Each bandwidth-sharing band
is assigned a deficit counter, initialized to quantum
assigned by a <b>quanta</b> element. ETS maintains an
(internal) &rsquo;&rsquo;active&rsquo;&rsquo; list of
bandwidth-sharing bands whose qdiscs are non-empty. This
list is used for dequeuing. A packet is dequeued from the
band at the head of the list if the packet size is smaller
or equal to the deficit counter. If the counter is too
small, it is increased by <b>quantum</b> and the scheduler
moves on to the next band in the active list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only qdiscs
that own their queue should be added below the
bandwidth-sharing bands. Attaching to them
non-work-conserving qdiscs like TBF does not make sense
&minus;&minus; other qdiscs in the active list will be
skipped until the dequeue operation succeeds. This
limitation does not exist with the strict bands.</p>

<h2>CLASSIFICATION
<a name="CLASSIFICATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ETS qdisc
allows three ways to decide which band to enqueue a packet
to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- Packet
priority can be directly set to a class handle, in which
case that <br>
is the queue where the packet will be put. For example, band
number 2 of <br>
a qdisc with handle of 11: will have classid 11:3. To mark a
packet for <br>
queuing to this band, the packet priority should be set to
0x110003.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- A tc filter
attached to the qdisc can put the packet to a band by using
<br>
the <b>flowid</b> keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">- As a last
resort, the ETS qdisc consults its priomap (see below),
which <br>
maps packets to bands based on packet priority.</p>

<p>Each bandwidth-sharing band needs to know its quantum,
which is the amount of bytes a band is allowed to dequeue
before the scheduler moves to the next bandwidth-sharing
band. The <b>quanta</b> argument lists quanta for the
individual bandwidth-sharing bands. The minimum value of
each quantum is 1. If <b>quanta</b> is not given, the
default is no bandwidth-sharing bands, but note that when
specifying a large number of <b>bands,</b> the extra ones
are in bandwidth-sharing mode by default.</p></td></tr>

<td width="78%">


<p>Number of bands given explicitly. This value has to be
at least large enough to cover the strict bands specified
through the <b>strict</b> keyword and bandwidth-sharing
bands specified in <b>quanta.</b> If a larger value is
given, any extra bands are in bandwidth-sharing mode, and
their quanta are deduced from the interface MTU. If no value
is given, as many bands are created as necessary to cover
all bands implied by the <b>strict</b> and <b>quanta</b>
keywords.</p> </td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">priomap</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The priomap maps the priority
of a packet to a band. The argument is a list of numbers.
The first number indicates which band the packets with
priority 0 should be put to, the second is for priority 1,
and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">There can be up
to 16 numbers in the list. If there are fewer, the default
band that traffic with one of the unmentioned priorities
goes to is the last one.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE &amp; USAGE
<a name="EXAMPLE &amp; USAGE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Add a qdisc
with 8 bandwidth-sharing bands, using the interface MTU as
their quanta. Since all quanta are the same, this will lead
to equal distribution of bandwidth between the bands, each
will get about 12.5% of the link. The low 8 priorities go to
individual bands in a reverse 1:1 fashion (such that the
highest priority goes to the first band).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tweak the first
band of the above qdisc to give it a quantum of 2650, which
will give it about 20% of the link (and about 11.5% to the
remaining bands):</p>
