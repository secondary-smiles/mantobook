<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd&minus;resolved</b>
is a system service that provides network name resolution to
local applications. It implements a caching and validating
DNS/DNSSEC stub resolver, as well as an LLMNR and
MulticastDNS resolver and responder. Local applications may
submit network name resolution requests via three
interfaces:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
native, fully&minus;featured API
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> exposes on the bus, see
<b>org.freedesktop.resolve1</b>(5) and
<b>org.freedesktop.LogControl1</b>(5) for details. Usage of
this API is generally recommended to clients as it is
asynchronous and fully featured (for example, properly
returns DNSSEC validation status and interface scope for
addresses as necessary for supporting link&minus;local
networking).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
glibc <b>getaddrinfo</b>(3) API as defined by
<b><font color="#0000FF">RFC3493</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">and its related resolver functions,
including <b>gethostbyname</b>(3). This API is widely
supported, including beyond the Linux platform. In its
current form it does not expose DNSSEC validation status
information however, and is synchronous only. This API is
backed by the glibc Name Service Switch (<b>nss</b>(5)).
Usage of the glibc NSS module <b>nss-resolve</b>(8) is
required in order to allow glibc's NSS resolver functions to
resolve hostnames via
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Additionally, <b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> provides a local
DNS stub listener on the IP addresses 127.0.0.53 and
127.0.0.54 on the local loopback interface. Programs issuing
DNS requests directly, bypassing any local API may be
directed to this stub, in order to connect them to
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b>. Note however that it is
strongly recommended that local programs use the glibc NSS
or bus APIs instead (as described above), as various network
resolution concepts (such as link&minus;local addressing, or
LLMNR Unicode domains) cannot be mapped to the unicast DNS
protocol.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
DNS stub resolver on 127.0.0.53 provides the full feature
set of the local resolver, which includes offering
LLMNR/MulticastDNS resolution. The DNS stub resolver on
127.0.0.54 provides a more limited resolver, that operates
in &quot;proxy&quot; mode only, i.e. it will pass most DNS
messages relatively unmodified to the current upstream DNS
servers and back, but not try to process the messages
locally, and hence does not validate DNSSEC, or offer up
LLMNR/MulticastDNS. (It will translate to
DNS&minus;over&minus;TLS communication if needed
however.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
DNS servers contacted are determined from the global
settings in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, the per&minus;link
static settings in /etc/systemd/network/*.network files (in
case <b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) is used), the
per&minus;link dynamic settings received over DHCP,
information provided via <b>resolvectl</b>(1), and any DNS
server information made available by other system services.
See <b>resolved.conf</b>(5) and <b>systemd.network</b>(5)
for details about systemd's own configuration files for DNS
servers. To improve compatibility, /etc/resolv.conf is read
in order to discover configured system DNS servers, but only
if it is not a symlink to
/run/systemd/resolve/stub&minus;resolv.conf,
/usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf or
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf (see below).</font></p>

<h2>SYNTHETIC RECORDS
<a name="SYNTHETIC RECORDS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>systemd&minus;resolved</b>
synthesizes DNS resource records (RRs) for the following
cases:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The local, configured hostname is resolved to all locally
configured IP addresses ordered by their scope, or &mdash;
if none are configured &mdash; the IPv4 address 127.0.0.2
(which is on the local loopback interface) and the IPv6
address ::1 (which is the local host).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The hostnames &quot;localhost&quot; and
&quot;localhost.localdomain&quot; as well as any hostname
ending in &quot;.localhost&quot; or
&quot;.localhost.localdomain&quot; are resolved to the IP
addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The hostname &quot;_gateway&quot; is resolved to all current
default routing gateway addresses, ordered by their metric.
This assigns a stable hostname to the current gateway,
useful for referencing it independently of the current
network configuration state.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The hostname &quot;_outbound&quot; is resolved to the local
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses that are most likely used for
communication with other hosts. This is determined by
requesting a routing decision to the configured default
gateways from the kernel and then using the local IP
addresses selected by this decision. This hostname is only
available if there is at least one local default gateway
configured. This assigns a stable hostname to the local
outbound IP addresses, useful for referencing them
independently of the current network configuration
state.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The hostname &quot;_localdnsstub&quot; is resolved to the IP
address 127.0.0.53, i.e. the address the local DNS stub (see
above) is listening on.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The hostname &quot;_localdnsproxy&quot; is resolved to the
IP address 127.0.0.54, i.e. the address the local DNS proxy
(see above) is listening on.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The mappings defined in /etc/hosts are resolved to their
configured addresses and back, but they will not affect
lookups for non&minus;address types (like MX). Support for
/etc/hosts may be disabled with <i>ReadEtcHosts=no</i>, see
<b>resolved.conf</b>(5).</font></p>

<h2>PROTOCOLS AND ROUTING
<a name="PROTOCOLS AND ROUTING"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
lookup requests that systemd&minus;resolved.service receives
are routed to the available DNS servers, LLMNR, and
MulticastDNS interfaces according to the following
rules:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Names for which synthetic records are generated (the local
hostname, &quot;localhost&quot; and &quot;localdomain&quot;,
local gateway, as listed in the previous section) and
addresses configured in /etc/hosts are never routed to the
network and a reply is sent immediately.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Single&minus;label names are resolved using LLMNR on all
local interfaces where LLMNR is enabled. Lookups for IPv4
addresses are only sent via LLMNR on IPv4, and lookups for
IPv6 addresses are only sent via LLMNR on IPv6. Note that
lookups for single&minus;label synthesized names are not
routed to LLMNR, MulticastDNS or unicast DNS.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Queries for the address records (A and AAAA) of
single&minus;label non&minus;synthesized names are resolved
via unicast DNS using search domains. For any interface
which defines search domains, such look&minus;ups are routed
to the servers defined for that interface, suffixed with
each of those search domains. When global search domains are
defined, such look&minus;ups are routed to the global
servers. For each search domain, queries are performed by
suffixing the name with each of the search domains in turn.
Additionally, lookup of single&minus;label names via unicast
DNS may be enabled with the
<i>ResolveUnicastSingleLabel=yes</i> setting. The details of
which servers are queried and how the final reply is chosen
are described below. Note that this means that address
queries for single&minus;label names are never sent out to
remote DNS servers by default, and resolution is only
possible if search domains are defined.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Multi&minus;label names with the domain suffix
&quot;.local&quot; are resolved using MulticastDNS on all
local interfaces where MulticastDNS is enabled. As with
LLMNR, IPv4 address lookups are sent via IPv4 and IPv6
address lookups are sent via IPv6.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Queries for multi&minus;label names are routed via unicast
DNS on local interfaces that have a DNS server configured,
plus the globally configured DNS servers if there are any.
Which interfaces are used is determined by the routing logic
based on search and route&minus;only domains, described
below. Note that by default, lookups for domains with the
&quot;.local&quot; suffix are not routed to DNS servers,
unless the domain is specified explicitly as routing or
search domain for the DNS server and interface. This means
that on networks where the &quot;.local&quot; domain is
defined in a site&minus;specific DNS server, explicit search
or routing domains need to be configured to make lookups
work within this DNS domain. Note that these days, it's
generally recommended to avoid defining &quot;.local&quot;
in a DNS server, as</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">RFC6762</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[2]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">reserves this domain for exclusive
MulticastDNS use.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Address lookups (reverse lookups) are routed similarly to
multi&minus;label names, with the exception that addresses
from the link&minus;local address range are never routed to
unicast DNS and are only resolved using LLMNR and
MulticastDNS (when enabled).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
lookups are routed to multiple interfaces, the first
successful response is returned (thus effectively merging
the lookup zones on all matching interfaces). If the lookup
failed on all interfaces, the last failing response is
returned.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Routing
of lookups is determined by the per&minus;interface routing
domains (search and route&minus;only) and global search
domains. See <b>systemd.network</b>(5) and
<b>resolvectl</b>(1) for a description how those settings
are set dynamically and the discussion of <i>Domains=</i> in
<b>resolved.conf</b>(5) for a description of globally
configured DNS settings.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
following query routing logic applies for unicast DNS
lookups initiated by
systemd&minus;resolved.service:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If a name to look up matches (that is: is equal to or has as
suffix) any of the configured routing domains (search or
route&minus;only) of any link, or the globally configured
DNS settings, &quot;best matching&quot; routing domain is
determined: the matching one with the most labels. The query
is then sent to all DNS servers of any links or the globally
configured DNS servers associated with this &quot;best
matching&quot; routing domain. (Note that more than one link
might have this same &quot;best matching&quot; routing
domain configured, in which case the query is sent to all of
them in parallel).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
case of single&minus;label names, when search domains are
defined, the same logic applies, except that the name is
first suffixed by each of the search domains in turn. Note
that this search logic doesn't apply to any names with at
least one dot. Also see the discussion about compatibility
with the traditional glibc resolver below.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If a query does not match any configured routing domain
(either per&minus;link or global), it is sent to all DNS
servers that are configured on links with the
<i>DefaultRoute=</i> option set, as well as the globally
configured DNS server.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If there is no link configured as <i>DefaultRoute=</i> and
no global DNS server configured, one of the
compiled&minus;in fallback DNS servers is used.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Otherwise the unicast DNS query fails, as no suitable DNS
servers can be determined.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<i>DefaultRoute=</i> option is a boolean setting
configurable with <b>resolvectl</b> or in .network files. If
not set, it is implicitly determined based on the configured
DNS domains for a link: if there's a route&minus;only domain
other than &quot;~.&quot;, it defaults to false, otherwise
to true.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Effectively
this means: in order to support single&minus;label
non&minus;synthesized names, define appropriate search
domains. In order to preferably route all DNS queries not
explicitly matched by routing domain configuration to a
specific link, configure a &quot;~.&quot; route&minus;only
domain on it. This will ensure that other links will not be
considered for these queries (unless they too carry such a
routing domain). In order to route all such DNS queries to a
specific link only if no other link is preferred, set the
<i>DefaultRoute=</i> option for the link to true and do not
configure a &quot;~.&quot; route&minus;only domain on it.
Finally, in order to ensure that a specific link never
receives any DNS traffic not matching any of its configured
routing domains, set the <i>DefaultRoute=</i> option for it
to false.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">See
<b>org.freedesktop.resolve1</b>(5) for information about the
D&minus;Bus APIs systemd&minus;resolved provides.</font></p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY WITH THE TRADITIONAL GLIBC STUB RESOLVER
<a name="COMPATIBILITY WITH THE TRADITIONAL GLIBC STUB RESOLVER"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
section provides a short summary of differences in the stub
resolver implemented by <b>nss-resolve</b>(8) together with
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> and the traditional stub
resolver implemented in nss&minus;dns.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Some names are always resolved internally (see Synthetic
Records above). Traditionally they would be resolved by
nss&minus;files if provided in /etc/hosts. But note that the
details of how a query is constructed are under the control
of the client library. nss&minus;dns will first try to
resolve names using search domains and even if those queries
are routed to systemd&minus;resolved, it will send them out
over the network using the usual rules for multi&minus;label
name routing <small>[3]</small> .</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Single&minus;label names are not resolved for A and AAAA
records using unicast DNS (unless overridden with
<i>ResolveUnicastSingleLabel=</i>, see
<b>resolved.conf</b>(5)). This is similar to the
<b>no&minus;tld&minus;query</b> option being set in
<b>resolv.conf</b>(5).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Search domains are not used for <i>suffixing</i> of
multi&minus;label names. (Search domains are nevertheless
used for lookup <i>routing</i>, for names that were
originally specified as single&minus;label or
multi&minus;label.) Any name with at least one dot is always
interpreted as a FQDN. nss&minus;dns would resolve names
both as relative (using search domains) and absolute FQDN
names. Some names would be resolved as relative first, and
after that query has failed, as absolute, while other names
would be resolved in opposite order. The <i>ndots</i> option
in /etc/resolv.conf was used to control how many dots the
name needs to have to be resolved as relative first. This
stub resolver does not implement this at all:
multi&minus;label names are only resolved as FQDNs.
<small>[4]</small></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
This resolver has a notion of the special &quot;.local&quot;
domain used for MulticastDNS, and will not route queries
with that suffix to unicast DNS servers unless explicitly
configured, see above. Also, reverse lookups for
link&minus;local addresses are not sent to unicast DNS
servers.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
This resolver reads and caches /etc/hosts internally. (In
other words, nss&minus;resolve replaces nss&minus;files in
addition to nss&minus;dns). Entries in /etc/hosts have
highest priority.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
This resolver also implements LLMNR and MulticastDNS in
addition to the classic unicast DNS protocol, and will
resolve single&minus;label names using LLMNR (when enabled)
and names ending in &quot;.local&quot; using MulticastDNS
(when enabled).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Environment variables <i>$LOCALDOMAIN</i> and
<i>$RES_OPTIONS</i> described in <b>resolv.conf</b>(5) are
not supported currently.</font></p>

<h2>/ETC/RESOLV.CONF
<a name="/ETC/RESOLV.CONF"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Four
modes of handling /etc/resolv.conf (see
<b>resolv.conf</b>(5)) are supported:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> maintains the
/run/systemd/resolve/stub&minus;resolv.conf file for
compatibility with traditional Linux programs. This file
lists the 127.0.0.53 DNS stub (see above) as the only DNS
server. It also contains a list of search domains that are
in use by systemd&minus;resolved. The list of search domains
is always kept up&minus;to&minus;date. Note that
/run/systemd/resolve/stub&minus;resolv.conf should not be
used directly by applications, but only through a symlink
from /etc/resolv.conf. This file may be symlinked from
/etc/resolv.conf in order to connect all local clients that
bypass local DNS APIs to <b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> with
correct search domains settings. This mode of operation is
recommended.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
A static file /usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf is provided that
lists the 127.0.0.53 DNS stub (see above) as only DNS
server. This file may be symlinked from /etc/resolv.conf in
order to connect all local clients that bypass local DNS
APIs to <b>systemd&minus;resolved</b>. This file does not
contain any search domains.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> maintains the
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf file for compatibility with
traditional Linux programs. This file may be symlinked from
/etc/resolv.conf and is always kept up&minus;to&minus;date,
containing information about all known DNS servers. Note the
file format's limitations: it does not know a concept of
per&minus;interface DNS servers and hence only contains
system&minus;wide DNS server definitions. Note that
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf should not be used directly
by applications, but only through a symlink from
/etc/resolv.conf. If this mode of operation is used local
clients that bypass any local DNS API will also bypass
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> and will talk directly to the
known DNS servers.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Alternatively, /etc/resolv.conf may be managed by other
packages, in which case <b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> will
read it for DNS configuration data. In this mode of
operation <b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> is consumer rather
than provider of this configuration file.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that the selected mode of operation for this file is
detected fully automatically, depending on whether
/etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf or lists 127.0.0.53 as DNS
server.</font></p>

<h2>SIGNALS
<a name="SIGNALS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>SIGUSR1</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Upon
reception of the <b>SIGUSR1</b> process signal
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> will dump the contents of all
DNS resource record caches it maintains, as well as all
feature level information it learnt about configured DNS
servers into the system logs.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>SIGUSR2</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Upon
reception of the <b>SIGUSR2</b> process signal
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> will flush all caches it
maintains. Note that it should normally not be necessary to
request this explicitly &ndash; except for debugging
purposes &ndash; as <b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> flushes
the caches automatically anyway any time the host's network
configuration changes. Sending this signal to
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> is equivalent to the
<b>resolvectl flush&minus;caches</b> command, however the
latter is recommended since it operates in a synchronous
way.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>SIGRTMIN+1</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Upon
reception of the <b>SIGRTMIN+1</b> process signal
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> will forget everything it
learnt about the configured DNS servers. Specifically any
information about server feature support is flushed out, and
the server feature probing logic is restarted on the next
request, starting with the most fully featured level. Note
that it should normally not be necessary to request this
explicitly &ndash; except for debugging purposes &ndash; as
<b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> automatically forgets learnt
information any time the DNS server configuration changes.
Sending this signal to <b>systemd&minus;resolved</b> is
equivalent to the <b>resolvectl
reset&minus;server&minus;features</b> command, however the
latter is recommended since it operates in a synchronous
way.</font></p>

<h2>CREDENTIALS
<a name="CREDENTIALS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>systemd&minus;resolved</b>
supports the service credentials logic as implemented by
<i>LoadCredential=</i>/<i>SetCredential=</i> (see
<b>systemd.exec</b>(1) for details). The following
credentials are used when passed in:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>network.dns</i>,
<i>network.search_domains</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">May

<h2>KERNEL COMMAND LINE
<a name="KERNEL COMMAND LINE"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>systemd&minus;resolved</b>

currently more than 1500 top-level domain names defined, and
new ones are added regularly, often using
&quot;attractive&quot; names that are also likely to be used
locally. Not looking up multi-label names in this fashion
avoids fragility in both directions: a valid global name
could be obscured by a local name, and resolution of a
relative local name could suddenly break when a new
top-level domain is created, or when a new subdomain of a
top-level domain in registered. Resolving any given name as
either relative or absolute avoids this
ambiguity.</font></p> </td></tr>
