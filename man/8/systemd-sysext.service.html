<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd&minus;sysext</b>
activates/deactivates system extension images. System
extension images may &ndash; dynamically at runtime &mdash;
extend the /usr/ and /opt/ directory hierarchies with
additional files. This is particularly useful on immutable
system images where a /usr/ and/or /opt/ hierarchy residing
on a read&minus;only file system shall be extended
temporarily at runtime without making any persistent
modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">System
extension images should contain files and directories
similar in fashion to regular operating system tree. When
one or more system extension images are activated, their
/usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies are combined via
&quot;overlayfs&quot; with the same hierarchies of the host
OS, and the host /usr/ and /opt/ overmounted with it
(&quot;merging&quot;). When they are deactivated, the mount
point is disassembled &mdash; again revealing the unmodified
original host version of the hierarchy
(&quot;unmerging&quot;). Merging thus makes the extension's
resources suddenly appear below the /usr/ and /opt/
hierarchies as if they were included in the base OS image
itself. Unmerging makes them disappear again, leaving in
place only the files that were shipped with the base OS
image itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files and
directories contained in the extension images outside of the
/usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies are <i>not</i> merged, and hence
have no effect when included in a system extension image. In
particular, files in the /etc/ and /var/ included in a
system extension image will <i>not</i> appear in the
respective hierarchies after activation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">System
extension images are strictly read&minus;only, and the host
/usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies become read&minus;only too while
they are activated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">System
extensions are supposed to be purely additive, i.e. they are
supposed to include only files that do not exist in the
underlying basic OS image. However, the underlying mechanism
(overlayfs) also allows overlaying or removing files, but it
is recommended not to make use of this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">System
extension images may be provided in the following
formats:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. Plain
directories or btrfs subvolumes containing the OS tree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. Disk images
with a GPT disk label, following the
<b><font color="#0000FF">Discoverable Partitions
Specification</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">3.
Disk images lacking a partition table, with a naked Linux
file system (e.g. erofs, squashfs or ext4)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">These
image formats are the same ones that
<b>systemd-nspawn</b>(1) supports via its
<b>&minus;&minus;directory=</b>/<b>&minus;&minus;image=</b>
switches and those that the service manager supports via
<b>RootDirectory=</b>/<b>RootImage=</b>. Similar to them
they may optionally carry Verity authentication
information.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">System
extensions are automatically looked for in the directories
/etc/extensions/, /run/extensions/, /var/lib/extensions/,
/usr/lib/extensions/ and /usr/local/lib/extensions/. The
first two listed directories are not suitable for carrying
large binary images, however are still useful for carrying
symlinks to them. The primary place for installing system
extensions is /var/lib/extensions/. Any directories found in
these search directories are considered directory based
extension images, any files with the .raw suffix are
considered disk image based extension images.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">During
boot OS extension images are activated automatically, if the
systemd&minus;sysext.service is enabled. Note that this
service runs only after the underlying file systems where
system extensions may be located have been mounted. This
means they are not suitable for shipping resources that are
processed by subsystems running in earliest boot.
Specifically, OS extension images are not suitable for
shipping system services or <b>systemd-sysusers</b>(8)
definitions. See the</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">Portable Services
Documentation</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[2]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">for a simple mechanism for shipping
system services in disk images, in a similar fashion to OS
extensions. Note the different isolation on these two
mechanisms: while system extension directly extend the
underlying OS image with additional files that appear in a
way very similar to as if they were shipped in the OS image
itself and thus imply no security isolation, portable
services imply service level sandboxing in one way or
another. The systemd&minus;sysext.service service is
guaranteed to finish start&minus;up before basic.target is
reached; i.e. at the time regular services initialize (those
which do not use <i>DefaultDependencies=no</i>), the files
and directories system extensions provide are available in
/usr/ and /opt/ and may be accessed.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that there is no concept of enabling/disabling installed
system extension images: all installed extension images are
automatically activated at boot. However, you can place an
empty directory named like the extension (no .raw) in
/etc/extensions/ to &quot;mask&quot; an extension with the
same name in a system folder with lower
precedence.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">A
simple mechanism for version compatibility is enforced: a
system extension image must carry a
/usr/lib/extension&minus;release.d/extension&minus;release.<i>$name</i>
file, which must match its image name, that is compared with
the host os&minus;release file: the contained <i>ID=</i>
fields have to match unless &quot;_any&quot; is set for the
extension. If the extension <i>ID=</i> is not
&quot;_any&quot;, the <i>SYSEXT_LEVEL=</i> field (if
defined) has to match. If the latter is not defined, the
<i>VERSION_ID=</i> field has to match instead. If the
extension defines the <i>ARCHITECTURE=</i> field and the
value is not &quot;_any&quot; it has to match the kernel's
architecture reported by <b>uname</b>(2) but the used
architecture identifiers are the same as for
<i>ConditionArchitecture=</i> described in
<b>systemd.unit</b>(5). System extensions should not ship a
/usr/lib/os&minus;release file (as that would be merged into
the host /usr/ tree, overriding the host OS version data,
which is not desirable). The extension&minus;release file
follows the same format and semantics, and carries the same
content, as the os&minus;release file of the OS, but it
describes the resources carried in the extension
image.</font></p>

<h2>USES
<a name="USES"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
primary use case for system images are immutable
environments where debugging and development tools shall
optionally be made available, but not included in the
immutable base OS image itself (e.g. <b>strace</b>(1) and
<b>gdb</b>(1) shall be an optionally installable addition in
order to make debugging/development easier). System
extension images should not be misunderstood as a generic
software packaging framework, as no dependency scheme is
available: system extensions should carry all files they
need themselves, except for those already shipped in the
underlying host system image. Typically, system extension
images are built at the same time as the base OS image
&mdash; within the same build system.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Another
use case for the system extension concept is temporarily
overriding OS supplied resources with newer ones, for
example to install a locally compiled development version of
some low&minus;level component over the immutable OS image
without doing a full OS rebuild or modifying the nominally
immutable image. (e.g. &quot;install&quot; a locally built
package with <b>DESTDIR=/var/lib/extensions/mytest make
install &amp;&amp; systemd&minus;sysext refresh</b>, making
it available in /usr/ as if it was installed in the OS image
itself.) This case works regardless if the underlying host
/usr/ is managed as immutable disk image or is a traditional
package manager controlled (i.e. writable) tree.</font></p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
following commands are understood:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>status</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">When
invoked without any command verb, or when <b>status</b> is
specified the current merge status is shown, separately for
both /usr/ and /opt/.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>merge</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Merges
all currently installed system extension images into /usr/
and /opt/, by overmounting these hierarchies with an
&quot;overlayfs&quot; file system combining the underlying
hierarchies with those included in the extension images.
This command will fail if the hierarchies are already
merged.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>unmerge</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Unmerges
all currently installed system extension images from /usr/
and /opt/, by unmounting the &quot;overlayfs&quot; file
systems created by <b>merge</b> prior.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>refresh</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A
combination of <b>unmerge</b> and <b>merge</b>: if already
mounted the existing &quot;overlayfs&quot; instance is
unmounted temporarily, and then replaced by a new version.
This command is useful after installing/removing system
extension images, in order to update the
&quot;overlayfs&quot; file system accordingly. If no system
extensions are installed when this command is executed, the
equivalent of <b>unmerge</b> is executed, without
establishing any new &quot;overlayfs&quot; instance. Note
that currently there's a brief moment where neither the old
nor the new &quot;overlayfs&quot; file system is mounted.
This implies that all resources supplied by a system
extension will briefly disappear &mdash; even if it exists
continuously during the refresh operation.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>list</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A brief

relative to the specified root directory, i.e. establish the
&quot;overlayfs&quot; mount not on the top&minus;level host
/usr/ and /opt/ hierarchies, but below some specified root
