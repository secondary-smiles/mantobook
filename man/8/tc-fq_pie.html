<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">FQ-PIE (Flow
Queuing with Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) is a
queuing discipline that combines Flow Queuing with the PIE
AQM scheme. FQ-PIE uses a Jenkins hash function to classify
incoming packets into different flows and is used to provide
a fair share of the bandwidth to all the flows using the
qdisc. Each such flow is managed by the PIE algorithm.</p>

<h2>ALGORITHM
<a name="ALGORITHM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The FQ-PIE
algorithm consists of two logical parts: the scheduler which
selects which queue to dequeue a packet from, and the PIE
AQM which works on each of the queues. The major work of
FQ-PIE is mostly in the scheduling part. The interaction
between the scheduler and the PIE algorithm is straight
forward.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During the
enqueue stage, a hashing-based scheme is used, where flows
are hashed into a number of buckets with each bucket having
its own queue. The number of buckets is configurable, and
presently defaults to 1024 in the implementation. The flow
hashing is performed on the 5-tuple of source and
destination IP addresses, port numbers and IP protocol
number. Once the packet has been successfully classified
into a queue, it is handed over to the PIE algorithm for
enqueuing. It is then added to the tail of the selected
queue, and the queue&rsquo;s byte count is updated by the
packet size. If the queue is not currently active (i.e., if
it is not in either the list of new or the list of old
queues) , it is added to the end of the list of new queues,
and its number of credits is initiated to the configured
quantum. Otherwise, the queue is left in its current queue
list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During the
dequeue stage, the scheduler first looks at the list of new
queues; for the queue at the head of that list, if that
queue has a negative number of credits (i.e., it has already
dequeued at least a quantum of bytes), it is given an
additional quantum of credits, the queue is put onto the end
of the list of old queues, and the routine selects the next
queue and starts again. Otherwise, that queue is selected
for dequeue again. If the list of new queues is empty, the
scheduler proceeds down the list of old queues in the same
fashion (checking the credits, and either selecting the
queue for dequeuing, or adding credits and putting the queue
back at the end of the list). After having selected a queue
from which to dequeue a packet, the PIE algorithm is invoked
on that queue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, if the
PIE algorithm does not return a packet, then the queue must
be empty and the scheduler does one of two things:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the queue
selected for dequeue came from the list of new queues, it is
moved to the end of the list of old queues. If instead it
came from the list of old queues, that queue is removed from
the list, to be added back (as a new queue) the next time a
packet arrives that hashes to that queue. Then (since no
packet was available for dequeue), the whole dequeue process
is restarted from the beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If, instead,
the scheduler did get a packet back from the PIE algorithm,
it subtracts the size of the packet from the byte credits
for the selected queue and returns the packet as the result
of the dequeue operation.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>limit</b>
<br>
It is the limit on the queue size in packets. Incoming
packets are dropped when the limit is reached. The default
value is 10240 packets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>flows</b>
<br>
It is the number of flows into which the incoming packets
are classified. Due to the stochastic nature of hashing,
multiple flows may end up being hashed into the same slot.
Newer flows have priority over older ones. This parameter
can be set only at load time since memory has to be
allocated for the hash table. The default value is 1024.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>target</b>
<br>
It is the queue delay which the PIE algorithm tries to
maintain. The default target delay is 15ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>tupdate</b>
<br>
It is the time interval at which the system drop probability
is calculated. The default is 15ms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>alpha <br>
beta</b> <br>
alpha and beta are parameters chosen to control the drop
probability. These should be in the range between 0 and
32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>quantum</b>
<br>
quantum signifies the number of bytes that may be dequeued
from a queue before switching to the next queue in the
deficit round robin scheme.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>memory_limit</b>
<br>
It is the maximum total memory allowed for packets of all
flows. The default is 32Mb.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ecn_prob</b>
<br>
It is the drop probability threshold below which packets
will be ECN marked instead of getting dropped. The default
is 10%. Setting this parameter requires <b>ecn</b> to be
enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[<b>no</b>]<b>ecn</b>
<br>
It has the same semantics as <b>pie</b> and can be used to
mark packets instead of dropping them. If <b>ecn</b> has
been enabled, <b>noecn</b> can be used to turn it off and
vice-a-versa.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[<b>no</b>]<b>bytemode</b>
<br>
It is used to scale drop probability proportional to packet
size <b>bytemode</b> to turn on bytemode, <b>nobytemode</b>
to turn off bytemode. By default, <b>bytemode</b> is turned
off.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[<b>no_</b>]<b>dq_rate_estimator
<br>
dq_rate_estimator</b> can be used to calculate queue delay
using Little&rsquo;s Law, <b>no_dq_rate_estimator</b> can be
used to calculate queue delay using timestamp. By default,
<b>dq_rate_estimator</b> is turned off.</p>
