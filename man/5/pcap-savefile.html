<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE:
applications and libraries should, if possible, use libpcap
to read savefiles, rather than having their own code to read
savefiles. If, in the future, a new file format is supported
by libpcap, applications and libraries using libpcap to read
savefiles will be able to read the new format of savefiles,
but applications and libraries using their own code to read
savefiles will have to be changed to support the new file
format.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lsquo;&lsquo;Savefiles&rsquo;&rsquo;
read and written by libpcap and applications using libpcap
start with a per-file header. The format of the per-file
header is:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-35826321.png" alt="Image grohtml-35826321.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The per-file
header length is 24 octets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All fields in
the per-file header are in the byte order of the host
writing the file. Normally, the first field in the per-file
header is a 4-byte magic number, with the value 0xa1b2c3d4.
The magic number, when read by a host with the same byte
order as the host that wrote the file, will have the value
0xa1b2c3d4, and, when read by a host with the opposite byte
order as the host that wrote the file, will have the value
0xd4c3b2a1. That allows software reading the file to
determine whether the byte order of the host that wrote the
file is the same as the byte order of the host on which the
file is being read, and thus whether the values in the
per-file and per-packet headers need to be byte-swapped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the magic
number has the value 0xa1b23c4d (with the two nibbles of the
two lower-order bytes of the magic number swapped), which
would be read as 0xa1b23c4d by a host with the same byte
order as the host that wrote the file and as 0x4d3cb2a1 by a
host with the opposite byte order as the host that wrote the
file, the file format is the same as for regular files,
except that the time stamps for packets are given in seconds
and nanoseconds rather than seconds and microseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Following this
are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A 2-byte file
format major version number; the current version number is
2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A 2-byte file
format minor version number; the current version number is
4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A 4-byte time
zone offset; this is always 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A 4-byte number
giving the accuracy of time stamps in the file; this is
always 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A 4-byte number
giving the &quot;snapshot length&quot; of the capture;
packets longer than the snapshot length are truncated to the
snapshot length, so that, if the snapshot length is
<i>N</i>, only the first <i>N</i> bytes of a packet longer
than <i>N</i> bytes will be saved in the capture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">a 4-byte number
giving the link-layer header type for packets in the
capture; see <b>pcap-linktype</b>(7) for the
<b>LINKTYPE_</b> values that can appear in this field.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Following the
per-file header are zero or more packets; each packet begins
with a per-packet header, which is immediately followed by
the raw packet data. The format of the per-packet header
is:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-35826322.png" alt="Image grohtml-35826322.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The per-packet
header length is 16 octets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All fields in
the per-packet header are in the byte order of the host
writing the file. The per-packet header begins with a time
stamp giving the approximate time the packet was captured;
the time stamp consists of a 4-byte value, giving the time
in seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, followed by
a 4-byte value, giving the time in microseconds or
nanoseconds since that second, depending on the magic number
in the file header. Following that are a 4-byte value giving
the number of bytes of captured data that follow the
per-packet header and a 4-byte value giving the number of
bytes that would have been present had the packet not been
truncated by the snapshot length. The two lengths will be
equal if the number of bytes of packet data are less than or
equal to the snapshot length.</p>
