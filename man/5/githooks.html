<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$GIT_DIR/hooks/*
(or &lsquo;git config core.hooksPath&lsquo;/*)</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hooks are
programs you can place in a hooks directory to trigger
actions at certain points in git&rsquo;s execution. Hooks
that don&rsquo;t have the executable bit set are
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default the
hooks directory is <b>$GIT_DIR/hooks</b>, but that can be
changed via the <b>core.hooksPath</b> configuration variable
(see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Git
invokes a hook, it changes its working directory to either
$GIT_DIR in a bare repository or the root of the working
tree in a non&minus;bare repository. An exception are hooks
triggered during a push (<i>pre&minus;receive</i>,
<i>update</i>, <i>post&minus;receive</i>,
<i>post&minus;update</i>,
<i>push&minus;to&minus;checkout</i>) which are always
executed in $GIT_DIR.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Environment
variables, such as <b>GIT_DIR</b>, <b>GIT_WORK_TREE</b>,
etc., are exported so that Git commands run by the hook can
correctly locate the repository. If your hook needs to
invoke Git commands in a foreign repository or in a
different working tree of the same repository, then it
should clear these environment variables so they do not
interfere with Git operations at the foreign location. For
example:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">local_desc=$(git
describe) <br>
foreign_desc=$(unset $(git rev&minus;parse
&minus;&minus;local&minus;env&minus;vars); git &minus;C
../foreign&minus;repo describe)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hooks can get
their arguments via the environment, command&minus;line
arguments, and stdin. See the documentation for each hook
below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git init</b>
may copy hooks to the new repository, depending on its
configuration. See the &quot;TEMPLATE DIRECTORY&quot;
section in <b>git-init</b>(1) for details. When the rest of
this document refers to &quot;default hooks&quot; it&rsquo;s
talking about the default template shipped with Git.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The currently
supported hooks are described below.</p>

<h2>HOOKS
<a name="HOOKS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>applypatch&minus;msg</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-am</b>(1). It takes a single
parameter, the name of the file that holds the proposed
commit log message. Exiting with a non&minus;zero status
causes <b>git am</b> to abort before applying the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hook is
allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be used
to normalize the message into some project standard format.
It can also be used to refuse the commit after inspecting
the message file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>applypatch&minus;msg</i> hook, when enabled, runs the
<i>commit&minus;msg</i> hook, if the latter is enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pre&minus;applypatch</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-am</b>(1). It takes no
parameter, and is invoked after the patch is applied, but
before a commit is made.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If it exits
with non&minus;zero status, then the working tree will not
be committed after applying the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It can be used
to inspect the current working tree and refuse to make a
commit if it does not pass certain test.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>pre&minus;applypatch</i> hook, when enabled, runs the
<i>pre&minus;commit</i> hook, if the latter is enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>post&minus;applypatch</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-am</b>(1). It takes no
parameter, and is invoked after the patch is applied and a
commit is made.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook is
meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the
outcome of <b>git am</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pre&minus;commit</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-commit</b>(1), and can be
bypassed with the <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;verify</b>
option. It takes no parameters, and is invoked before
obtaining the proposed commit log message and making a
commit. Exiting with a non&minus;zero status from this
script causes the <b>git commit</b> command to abort before
creating a commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>pre&minus;commit</i> hook, when enabled, catches
introduction of lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts
the commit when such a line is found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All the <b>git
commit</b> hooks are invoked with the environment variable
<b>GIT_EDITOR=:</b> if the command will not bring up an
editor to modify the commit message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>pre&minus;commit</i> hook, when enabled&mdash;and with
the <b>hooks.allownonascii</b> config option unset or set to
false&mdash;prevents the use of non&minus;ASCII
filenames.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pre&minus;merge&minus;commit</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-merge</b>(1), and can be
bypassed with the <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;verify</b>
option. It takes no parameters, and is invoked after the
merge has been carried out successfully and before obtaining
the proposed commit log message to make a commit. Exiting
with a non&minus;zero status from this script causes the
<b>git merge</b> command to abort before creating a
commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>pre&minus;merge&minus;commit</i> hook, when enabled, runs
the <i>pre&minus;commit</i> hook, if the latter is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook is
invoked with the environment variable <b>GIT_EDITOR=:</b> if
the command will not bring up an editor to modify the commit
message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the merge
cannot be carried out automatically, the conflicts need to
be resolved and the result committed separately (see
<b>git-merge</b>(1)). At that point, this hook will not be
executed, but the <i>pre&minus;commit</i> hook will, if it
is enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>prepare&minus;commit&minus;msg</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-commit</b>(1) right after
preparing the default log message, and before the editor is
started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It takes one to
three parameters. The first is the name of the file that
contains the commit log message. The second is the source of
the commit message, and can be: <b>message</b> (if a
<b>&minus;m</b> or <b>&minus;F</b> option was given);
<b>template</b> (if a <b>&minus;t</b> option was given or
the configuration option <b>commit.template</b> is set);
<b>merge</b> (if the commit is a merge or a
<b>.git/MERGE_MSG</b> file exists); <b>squash</b> (if a
<b>.git/SQUASH_MSG</b> file exists); or <b>commit</b>,
followed by a commit object name (if a <b>&minus;c</b>,
<b>&minus;C</b> or <b>&minus;&minus;amend</b> option was
given).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the exit
status is non&minus;zero, <b>git commit</b> will abort.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The purpose of
the hook is to edit the message file in place, and it is not
suppressed by the <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;verify</b>
option. A non&minus;zero exit means a failure of the hook
and aborts the commit. It should not be used as replacement
for pre&minus;commit hook.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sample
<b>prepare&minus;commit&minus;msg</b> hook that comes with
Git removes the help message found in the commented portion
of the commit template.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>commit&minus;msg</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-commit</b>(1) and
<b>git-merge</b>(1), and can be bypassed with the
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;verify</b> option. It takes a
single parameter, the name of the file that holds the
proposed commit log message. Exiting with a non&minus;zero
status causes the command to abort.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hook is
allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be used
to normalize the message into some project standard format.
It can also be used to refuse the commit after inspecting
the message file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>commit&minus;msg</i> hook, when enabled, detects
duplicate <b>Signed&minus;off&minus;by</b> trailers, and
aborts the commit if one is found.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>post&minus;commit</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-commit</b>(1). It takes no
parameters, and is invoked after a commit is made.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook is
meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the
outcome of <b>git commit</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pre&minus;rebase</b>
<br>
This hook is called by <b>git-rebase</b>(1) and can be used
to prevent a branch from getting rebased. The hook may be
called with one or two parameters. The first parameter is
the upstream from which the series was forked. The second
parameter is the branch being rebased, and is not set when
rebasing the current branch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>post&minus;checkout</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked when a <b>git-checkout</b>(1) or
<b>git-switch</b>(1) is run after having updated the
worktree. The hook is given three parameters: the ref of the
previous HEAD, the ref of the new HEAD (which may or may not
have changed), and a flag indicating whether the checkout
was a branch checkout (changing branches, flag=1) or a file
checkout (retrieving a file from the index, flag=0). This
hook cannot affect the outcome of <b>git switch</b> or
<b>git checkout</b>, other than that the hook&rsquo;s exit
status becomes the exit status of these two commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also run
after <b>git-clone</b>(1), unless the
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;checkout</b> (<b>&minus;n</b>)
option is used. The first parameter given to the hook is the
null&minus;ref, the second the ref of the new HEAD and the
flag is always 1. Likewise for <b>git worktree add</b>
unless <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;checkout</b> is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook can
be used to perform repository validity checks,
auto&minus;display differences from the previous HEAD if
different, or set working dir metadata properties.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>post&minus;merge</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-merge</b>(1), which happens
when a <b>git pull</b> is done on a local repository. The
hook takes a single parameter, a status flag specifying
whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge. This
hook cannot affect the outcome of <b>git merge</b> and is
not executed, if the merge failed due to conflicts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook can
be used in conjunction with a corresponding pre&minus;commit
hook to save and restore any form of metadata associated
with the working tree (e.g.: permissions/ownership, ACLS,
etc). See contrib/hooks/setgitperms.perl for an example of
how to do this.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pre&minus;push</b>
<br>
This hook is called by <b>git-push</b>(1) and can be used to
prevent a push from taking place. The hook is called with
two parameters which provide the name and location of the
destination remote, if a named remote is not being used both
values will be the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Information
about what is to be pushed is provided on the hook&rsquo;s
standard input with lines of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;local
ref&gt; SP &lt;local object name&gt; SP &lt;remote ref&gt;
SP &lt;remote object name&gt; LF</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For instance,
if the command <b>git push origin master:foreign</b> were
run the hook would receive a line like the following:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">refs/heads/master
67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">although the
full object name would be supplied. If the foreign ref does
not yet exist the <b>&lt;remote object name&gt;</b> will be
the all&minus;zeroes object name. If a ref is to be deleted,
the <b>&lt;local ref&gt;</b> will be supplied as
<b>(delete)</b> and the <b>&lt;local object name&gt;</b>
will be the all&minus;zeroes object name. If the local
commit was specified by something other than a name which
could be expanded (such as <b>HEAD~</b>, or an object name)
it will be supplied as it was originally given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If this hook
exits with a non&minus;zero status, <b>git push</b> will
abort without pushing anything. Information about why the
push is rejected may be sent to the user by writing to
standard error.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pre&minus;receive</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it
reacts to <b>git push</b> and updates reference(s) in its
repository. Just before starting to update refs on the
remote repository, the pre&minus;receive hook is invoked.
Its exit status determines the success or failure of the
update.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook
executes once for the receive operation. It takes no
arguments, but for each ref to be updated it receives on
standard input a line of the format:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;old&minus;value&gt;
SP &lt;new&minus;value&gt; SP &lt;ref&minus;name&gt; LF</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<b>&lt;old&minus;value&gt;</b> is the old object name stored
in the ref, <b>&lt;new&minus;value&gt;</b> is the new object
name to be stored in the ref and
<b>&lt;ref&minus;name&gt;</b> is the full name of the ref.
When creating a new ref, <b>&lt;old&minus;value&gt;</b> is
the all&minus;zeroes object name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the hook
exits with non&minus;zero status, none of the refs will be
updated. If the hook exits with zero, updating of individual
refs can still be prevented by the <i>update</i> hook.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both standard
output and standard error output are forwarded to <b>git
send&minus;pack</b> on the other end, so you can simply
<b>echo</b> messages for the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The number of
push options given on the command line of <b>git push
&minus;&minus;push&minus;option=...</b> can be read from the
environment variable <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT</b>, and the
options themselves are found in <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_0</b>,
<b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_1</b>,... If it is negotiated to not use
the push options phase, the environment variables will not
be set. If the client selects to use push options, but
doesn&rsquo;t transmit any, the count variable will be set
to zero, <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT=0</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the section
on &quot;Quarantine Environment&quot; in
<b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) for some caveats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>update</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it
reacts to <b>git push</b> and updates reference(s) in its
repository. Just before updating the ref on the remote
repository, the update hook is invoked. Its exit status
determines the success or failure of the ref update.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hook
executes once for each ref to be updated, and takes three
parameters:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; the name
of the ref being updated,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; the old
object name stored in the ref,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; and the
new object name to be stored in the ref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A zero exit
from the update hook allows the ref to be updated. Exiting
with a non&minus;zero status prevents <b>git
receive&minus;pack</b> from updating that ref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook can
be used to prevent <i>forced</i> update on certain refs by
making sure that the object name is a commit object that is
a descendant of the commit object named by the old object
name. That is, to enforce a &quot;fast&minus;forward
only&quot; policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It could also
be used to log the old..new status. However, it does not
know the entire set of branches, so it would end up firing
one e&minus;mail per ref when used naively, though. The
<i>post&minus;receive</i> hook is more suited to that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In an
environment that restricts the users' access only to git
commands over the wire, this hook can be used to implement
access control without relying on filesystem ownership and
group membership. See <b>git-shell</b>(1) for how you might
use the login shell to restrict the user&rsquo;s access to
only git commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both standard
output and standard error output are forwarded to <b>git
send&minus;pack</b> on the other end, so you can simply
<b>echo</b> messages for the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>update</i> hook, when enabled&mdash;and with
<b>hooks.allowunannotated</b> config option unset or set to
false&mdash;prevents unannotated tags to be pushed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>proc&minus;receive</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1). If the
server has set the multi&minus;valued config variable
<b>receive.procReceiveRefs</b>, and the commands sent to
<i>receive&minus;pack</i> have matching reference names,
these commands will be executed by this hook, instead of by
the internal <b>execute_commands()</b> function. This hook
is responsible for updating the relevant references and
reporting the results back to <i>receive&minus;pack</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook
executes once for the receive operation. It takes no
arguments, but uses a pkt&minus;line format protocol to
communicate with <i>receive&minus;pack</i> to read commands,
push&minus;options and send results. In the following
example for the protocol, the letter <i>S</i> stands for
<i>receive&minus;pack</i> and the letter <i>H</i> stands for
this hook.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># Version and
features negotiation. <br>
S: PKT&minus;LINE(version=1\0push&minus;options atomic...)
<br>
S: flush&minus;pkt <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(version=1\0push&minus;options...) <br>
H: flush&minus;pkt</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># Send commands
from server to the hook. <br>
S: PKT&minus;LINE(&lt;old&minus;oid&gt;
&lt;new&minus;oid&gt; &lt;ref&gt;) <br>
S: ... ... <br>
S: flush&minus;pkt <br>
# Send push&minus;options only if the 'push&minus;options'
feature is enabled. <br>
S: PKT&minus;LINE(push&minus;option) <br>
S: ... ... <br>
S: flush&minus;pkt</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># Receive
result from the hook. <br>
# OK, run this command successfully. <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(ok &lt;ref&gt;) <br>
# NO, I reject it. <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(ng &lt;ref&gt; &lt;reason&gt;) <br>
# Fall through, let 'receive&minus;pack' to execute it. <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(ok &lt;ref&gt;) <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(option fall&minus;through) <br>
# OK, but has an alternate reference. The alternate
reference name <br>
# and other status can be given in option directives. <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(ok &lt;ref&gt;) <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(option refname &lt;refname&gt;) <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(option old&minus;oid
&lt;old&minus;oid&gt;) <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(option new&minus;oid
&lt;new&minus;oid&gt;) <br>
H: PKT&minus;LINE(option forced&minus;update) <br>
H: ... ... <br>
H: flush&minus;pkt</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each command
for the <i>proc&minus;receive</i> hook may point to a
pseudo&minus;reference and always has a zero&minus;old as
its old&minus;oid, while the <i>proc&minus;receive</i> hook
may update an alternate reference and the alternate
reference may exist already with a non&minus;zero
old&minus;oid. For this case, this hook will use
&quot;option&quot; directives to report extended attributes
for the reference given by the leading &quot;ok&quot;
directive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The report of
the commands of this hook should have the same order as the
input. The exit status of the <i>proc&minus;receive</i> hook
only determines the success or failure of the group of
commands sent to it, unless atomic push is in use.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>post&minus;receive</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it
reacts to <b>git push</b> and updates reference(s) in its
repository. It executes on the remote repository once after
all the refs have been updated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook
executes once for the receive operation. It takes no
arguments, but gets the same information as the
<i>pre&minus;receive</i> hook does on its standard
input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook does
not affect the outcome of <b>git receive&minus;pack</b>, as
it is called after the real work is done.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This supersedes
the <i>post&minus;update</i> hook in that it gets both old
and new values of all the refs in addition to their
names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both standard
output and standard error output are forwarded to <b>git
send&minus;pack</b> on the other end, so you can simply
<b>echo</b> messages for the user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>post&minus;receive</i> hook is empty, but there is a
sample script <b>post&minus;receive&minus;email</b> provided
in the <b>contrib/hooks</b> directory in Git distribution,
which implements sending commit emails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The number of
push options given on the command line of <b>git push
&minus;&minus;push&minus;option=...</b> can be read from the
environment variable <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT</b>, and the
options themselves are found in <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_0</b>,
<b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_1</b>,... If it is negotiated to not use
the push options phase, the environment variables will not
be set. If the client selects to use push options, but
doesn&rsquo;t transmit any, the count variable will be set
to zero, <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT=0</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>post&minus;update</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it
reacts to <b>git push</b> and updates reference(s) in its
repository. It executes on the remote repository once after
all the refs have been updated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It takes a
variable number of parameters, each of which is the name of
ref that was actually updated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook is
meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect the
outcome of <b>git receive&minus;pack</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>post&minus;update</i> hook can tell what are the heads
that were pushed, but it does not know what their original
and updated values are, so it is a poor place to do log
old..new. The <i>post&minus;receive</i> hook does get both
original and updated values of the refs. You might consider
it instead if you need them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When enabled,
the default <i>post&minus;update</i> hook runs <b>git
update&minus;server&minus;info</b> to keep the information
used by dumb transports (e.g., HTTP) up to date. If you are
publishing a Git repository that is accessible via HTTP, you
should probably enable this hook.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both standard
output and standard error output are forwarded to <b>git
send&minus;pack</b> on the other end, so you can simply
<b>echo</b> messages for the user.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reference&minus;transaction</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by any Git command that performs
reference updates. It executes whenever a reference
transaction is prepared, committed or aborted and may thus
get called multiple times. The hook does not cover symbolic
references (but that may change in the future).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hook takes
exactly one argument, which is the current state the given
reference transaction is in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;prepared&quot;: All reference updates have been queued
to the transaction and references were locked on disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;committed&quot;: The reference transaction was
committed and all references now have their respective new
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;aborted&quot;: The reference transaction was aborted,
no changes were performed and the locks have been
released.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each
reference update that was added to the transaction, the hook
receives on standard input a line of the format:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;old&minus;value&gt;
SP &lt;new&minus;value&gt; SP &lt;ref&minus;name&gt; LF</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
<b>&lt;old&minus;value&gt;</b> is the old object name passed
into the reference transaction,
<b>&lt;new&minus;value&gt;</b> is the new object name to be
stored in the ref and <b>&lt;ref&minus;name&gt;</b> is the
full name of the ref. When force updating the reference
regardless of its current value or when the reference is to
be created anew, <b>&lt;old&minus;value&gt;</b> is the
all&minus;zeroes object name. To distinguish these cases,
you can inspect the current value of
<b>&lt;ref&minus;name&gt;</b> via <b>git
rev&minus;parse</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit status
of the hook is ignored for any state except for the
&quot;prepared&quot; state. In the &quot;prepared&quot;
state, a non&minus;zero exit status will cause the
transaction to be aborted. The hook will not be called with
&quot;aborted&quot; state in that case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>push&minus;to&minus;checkout</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it
reacts to <b>git push</b> and updates reference(s) in its
repository, and when the push tries to update the branch
that is currently checked out and the
<b>receive.denyCurrentBranch</b> configuration variable is
set to <b>updateInstead</b>. Such a push by default is
refused if the working tree and the index of the remote
repository has any difference from the currently checked out
commit; when both the working tree and the index match the
current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed
tip of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the
default behaviour.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hook
receives the commit with which the tip of the current branch
is going to be updated. It can exit with a non&minus;zero
status to refuse the push (when it does so, it must not
modify the index or the working tree). Or it can make any
necessary changes to the working tree and to the index to
bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero
status.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the hook can simply run <b>git read&minus;tree &minus;u
&minus;m HEAD &quot;$1&quot;</b> in order to emulate <b>git
fetch</b> that is run in the reverse direction with <b>git
push</b>, as the two&minus;tree form of <b>git
read&minus;tree &minus;u &minus;m</b> is essentially the
same as <b>git switch</b> or <b>git checkout</b> that
switches branches while keeping the local changes in the
working tree that do not interfere with the difference
between the branches.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pre&minus;auto&minus;gc</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git gc &minus;&minus;auto</b>
(see <b>git-gc</b>(1)). It takes no parameter, and exiting
with non&minus;zero status from this script causes the
<b>git gc &minus;&minus;auto</b> to abort.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>post&minus;rewrite</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by commands that rewrite commits
(<b>git-commit</b>(1) when called with
<b>&minus;&minus;amend</b> and <b>git-rebase</b>(1);
however, full&minus;history (re)writing tools like
<b>git-fast-import</b>(1) or
<b><font color="#0000FF">git&minus;filter&minus;repo</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">typically do not call it!). Its first
argument denotes the command it was invoked by: currently
one of <b>amend</b> or <b>rebase</b>. Further
command&minus;dependent arguments may be passed in the
future.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
hook receives a list of the rewritten commits on stdin, in
the format</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&lt;old&minus;object&minus;name&gt;
SP &lt;new&minus;object&minus;name&gt; [ SP
&lt;extra&minus;info&gt; ] LF</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<i>extra&minus;info</i> is again command&minus;dependent. If
it is empty, the preceding SP is also omitted. Currently, no
commands pass any <i>extra&minus;info</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
hook always runs after the automatic note copying (see
&quot;notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;&quot; in
<b>git-config</b>(1)) has happened, and thus has access to
these notes.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
following command&minus;specific comments apply:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">rebase</font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">For the
<i>squash</i> and <i>fixup</i> operation, all commits that
were squashed are listed as being rewritten to the squashed
commit. This means that there will be several lines sharing
the same <i>new&minus;object&minus;name</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
commits are guaranteed to be listed in the order that they
were processed by rebase.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>sendemail&minus;validate</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-send-email</b>(1). It takes a
single parameter, the name of the file that holds the
e&minus;mail to be sent. Exiting with a non&minus;zero
status causes <b>git send&minus;email</b> to abort before
sending any e&minus;mails.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>fsmonitor&minus;watchman</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked when the configuration option
<b>core.fsmonitor</b> is set to
<b>.git/hooks/fsmonitor&minus;watchman</b> or
<b>.git/hooks/fsmonitor&minus;watchmanv2</b> depending on
the version of the hook to use.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Version
1 takes two arguments, a version (1) and the time in elapsed
nanoseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Version
2 takes two arguments, a version (2) and a token that is
used for identifying changes since the token. For watchman
this would be a clock id. This version must output to stdout
the new token followed by a NUL before the list of
files.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
hook should output to stdout the list of all files in the
working directory that may have changed since the requested
time. The logic should be inclusive so that it does not miss
any potential changes. The paths should be relative to the
root of the working directory and be separated by a single
NUL.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It
is OK to include files which have not actually changed. All
changes including newly&minus;created and deleted files
should be included. When files are renamed, both the old and
the new name should be included.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Git
will limit what files it checks for changes as well as which
directories are checked for untracked files based on the
path names given.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">An
optimized way to tell git &quot;all files have changed&quot;
is to return the filename <b>/</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
exit status determines whether git will use the data from
the hook to limit its search. On error, it will fall back to
verifying all files and folders.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>p4&minus;changelist</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git&minus;p4
submit</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<b>p4&minus;changelist</b> hook is executed after the
changelist message has been edited by the user. It can be
bypassed with the <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;verify</b>
option. It takes a single parameter, the name of the file
that holds the proposed changelist text. Exiting with a
non&minus;zero status causes the command to
abort.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
hook is allowed to edit the changelist file and can be used
to normalize the text into some project standard format. It
can also be used to refuse the Submit after inspect the
message file.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Run
<b>git&minus;p4 submit &minus;&minus;help</b> for

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>p4&minus;prepare&minus;changelist</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git&minus;p4
submit</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<b>p4&minus;prepare&minus;changelist</b> hook is executed
right after preparing the default changelist message and
before the editor is started. It takes one parameter, the
name of the file that contains the changelist text. Exiting
with a non&minus;zero status from the script will abort the
process.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place,
and it is not suppressed by the
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;verify</b> option. This hook is
called even if
<b>&minus;&minus;prepare&minus;p4&minus;only</b> is
set.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Run

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<b>p4&minus;post&minus;changelist</b> hook is invoked after
the submit has successfully occurred in P4. It takes no
parameters and is meant primarily for notification and
cannot affect the outcome of the git p4 submit
action.</font></p>

<br>
This hook is invoked by <b>git&minus;p4 submit</b>. It takes
no parameters and nothing from standard input. Exiting with
non&minus;zero status from this script prevent
<b>git&minus;p4 submit</b> from launching. It can be
bypassed with the <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;verify</b>
command line option. Run <b>git&minus;p4 submit

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>post&minus;index&minus;change</b>
<br>
This hook is invoked when the index is written in
read&minus;cache.c do_write_locked_index.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
first parameter passed to the hook is the indicator for the

working directory was updated or &quot;0&quot; when the
working directory was not updated.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
second parameter passed to the hook is the indicator for
whether or not the index was updated and the
skip&minus;worktree bit could have changed. &quot;1&quot;
meaning skip&minus;worktree bits could have been updated and
&quot;0&quot; meaning they were not.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Only
one parameter should be set to &quot;1&quot; when the hook
