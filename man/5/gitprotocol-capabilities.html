<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;over&minus;the&minus;wire&minus;protocol&gt;</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
this document describes capabilities for versions 0 and 1 of
the pack protocol. For version 2, please refer to the
<b>gitprotocol-v2</b>(5) doc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Servers SHOULD
support all capabilities defined in this document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the very
first line of the initial server response of either
receive&minus;pack and upload&minus;pack the first reference
is followed by a NUL byte and then a list of space delimited
server capabilities. These allow the server to declare what
it can and cannot support to the client.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Client will
then send a space separated list of capabilities it wants to
be in effect. The client MUST NOT ask for capabilities the
server did not say it supports.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Server MUST
diagnose and abort if capabilities it does not understand
was sent. Server MUST NOT ignore capabilities that client
requested and server advertised. As a consequence of these
rules, server MUST NOT advertise capabilities it does not
understand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>atomic</i>, <i>report&minus;status</i>,
<i>report&minus;status&minus;v2</i>,
<i>delete&minus;refs</i>, <i>quiet</i>, and
<i>push&minus;cert</i> capabilities are sent and recognized
by the receive&minus;pack (push to server) process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>ofs&minus;delta</i> and <i>side&minus;band&minus;64k</i>
capabilities are sent and recognized by both
upload&minus;pack and receive&minus;pack protocols. The
<i>agent</i> and <i>session&minus;id</i> capabilities may
optionally be sent in both protocols.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All other
capabilities are only recognized by the upload&minus;pack
(fetch from server) process.</p>

<h2>MULTI_ACK
<a name="MULTI_ACK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
<i>multi_ack</i> capability allows the server to return
&quot;ACK obj&minus;id continue&quot; as soon as it finds a
commit that it can use as a common base, between the
client&rsquo;s wants and the client&rsquo;s have
set.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>By sending
this early, the server can potentially head off the client
from walking any further down that particular branch of the
client&rsquo;s repository history. The client may still need
to walk down other branches, sending have lines for those,
until the server has a complete cut across the DAG, or the
client has said &quot;done&quot;.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Without
multi_ack, a client sends have lines in
&minus;&minus;date&minus;order until the server has found a
common base. That means the client will send have lines that
are already known by the server to be common, because they
overlap in time with another branch that the server
hasn&rsquo;t found a common base on yet.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>For
example suppose the client has commits in caps that the
server doesn&rsquo;t and the server has commits in lower
case that the client doesn&rsquo;t, as in the following
diagram:</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
u
&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;
x <br>
/ +&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus; y <br>
/ / <br>
a &minus;&minus; b &minus;&minus; c &minus;&minus; d
&minus;&minus; E &minus;&minus; F <br>
\ <br>
+&minus;&minus;&minus; Q &minus;&minus; R &minus;&minus;
S</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
client wants x,y and starts out by saying have F,S, the
server doesn&rsquo;t know what F,S is. Eventually the client
says &quot;have d&quot; and the server sends &quot;ACK d
continue&quot; to let the client know to stop walking down
that line (so don&rsquo;t send c&minus;b&minus;a), but
it&rsquo;s not done yet, it needs a base for x. The client
keeps going with S&minus;R&minus;Q, until a gets reached, at
which point the server has a clear base and it all
ends.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Without
multi_ack the client would have sent that c&minus;b&minus;a
chain anyway, interleaved with S&minus;R&minus;Q.</big></p>

<h2>MULTI_ACK_DETAILED
<a name="MULTI_ACK_DETAILED"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This is an
extension of multi_ack that permits client to better
understand the server&rsquo;s in&minus;memory state. See
<b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5), section &quot;Packfile
Negotiation&quot; for more information.</big></p>

<h2>NO&minus;DONE
<a name="NO&minus;DONE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
capability should only be used with the smart HTTP protocol.
If multi_ack_detailed and no&minus;done are both present,
then the sender is free to immediately send a pack following
its first &quot;ACK obj&minus;id ready&quot;
message.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Without
no&minus;done in the smart HTTP protocol, the server session
would end and the client has to make another trip to send
&quot;done&quot; before the server can send the pack.
no&minus;done removes the last round and thus slightly
reduces latency.</big></p>

<h2>THIN&minus;PACK
<a name="THIN&minus;PACK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>A thin
pack is one with deltas which reference base objects not
contained within the pack (but are known to exist at the
receiving end). This can reduce the network traffic
significantly, but it requires the receiving end to know how
to &quot;thicken&quot; these packs by adding the missing
bases to the pack.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
upload&minus;pack server advertises <i>thin&minus;pack</i>
when it can generate and send a thin pack. A client requests
the <i>thin&minus;pack</i> capability when it understands
how to &quot;thicken&quot; it, notifying the server that it
can receive such a pack. A client MUST NOT request the
<i>thin&minus;pack</i> capability if it cannot turn a thin
pack into a self&minus;contained pack.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Receive&minus;pack,
on the other hand, is assumed by default to be able to
handle thin packs, but can ask the client not to use the
feature by advertising the <i>no&minus;thin</i> capability.
A client MUST NOT send a thin pack if the server advertises
the <i>no&minus;thin</i> capability.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
reasons for this asymmetry are historical. The
receive&minus;pack program did not exist until after the
invention of thin packs, so historically the reference
implementation of receive&minus;pack always understood thin
packs. Adding <i>no&minus;thin</i> later allowed
receive&minus;pack to disable the feature in a
backwards&minus;compatible manner.</big></p>

<h2>SIDE&minus;BAND, SIDE&minus;BAND&minus;64K
<a name="SIDE&minus;BAND, SIDE&minus;BAND&minus;64K"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
capability means that server can send, and client understand
multiplexed progress reports and error info interleaved with
the packfile itself.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>These two
options are mutually exclusive. A modern client always
favors <i>side&minus;band&minus;64k</i>.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Either
mode indicates that the packfile data will be streamed
broken up into packets of up to either 1000 bytes in the
case of <i>side_band</i>, or 65520 bytes in the case of
<i>side_band_64k</i>. Each packet is made up of a leading
4&minus;byte pkt&minus;line length of how much data is in
the packet, followed by a 1&minus;byte stream code, followed
by the actual data.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The stream
code can be one of:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>1 &minus;
pack data <br>
2 &minus; progress messages <br>
3 &minus; fatal error message just before stream
aborts</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
&quot;side&minus;band&minus;64k&quot; capability came about
as a way for newer clients that can handle much larger
packets to request packets that are actually crammed nearly
full, while maintaining backward compatibility for the older
clients.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Further,
with side&minus;band and its up to 1000&minus;byte messages,
it&rsquo;s actually 999 bytes of payload and 1 byte for the
stream code. With side&minus;band&minus;64k, same deal, you
have up to 65519 bytes of data and 1 byte for the stream
code.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The client
MUST send only maximum of one of &quot;side&minus;band&quot;
and &quot;side&minus; band&minus;64k&quot;. Server MUST
diagnose it as an error if client requests both.</big></p>

<h2>OFS&minus;DELTA
<a name="OFS&minus;DELTA"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Server can
send, and client understand PACKv2 with delta referring to
its base by position in pack rather than by an obj&minus;id.
That is, they can send/read OBJ_OFS_DELTA (aka type 6) in a
packfile.</big></p>

<h2>AGENT
<a name="AGENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The server
may optionally send a capability of the form <b>agent=X</b>
to notify the client that the server is running version
<b>X</b>. The client may optionally return its own agent
string by responding with an <b>agent=Y</b> capability (but
it MUST NOT do so if the server did not mention the agent
capability). The <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> strings may contain
any printable ASCII characters except space (i.e., the byte
range 32 &lt; x &lt; 127), and are typically of the form
&quot;package/version&quot; (e.g., &quot;git/1.8.3.1&quot;).
The agent strings are purely informative for statistics and
debugging purposes, and MUST NOT be used to programmatically
assume the presence or absence of particular
features.</big></p>

<h2>OBJECT&minus;FORMAT
<a name="OBJECT&minus;FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
capability, which takes a hash algorithm as an argument,
indicates that the server supports the given hash
algorithms. It may be sent multiple times; if so, the first
one given is the one used in the ref
advertisement.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>When
provided by the client, this indicates that it intends to
use the given hash algorithm to communicate. The algorithm
provided must be one that the server supports.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If this
capability is not provided, it is assumed that the only
supported algorithm is SHA&minus;1.</big></p>

<h2>SYMREF
<a name="SYMREF"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
parameterized capability is used to inform the receiver
which symbolic ref points to which ref; for example,
&quot;symref=HEAD:refs/heads/master&quot; tells the receiver
that HEAD points to master. This capability can be repeated
to represent multiple symrefs.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Servers
SHOULD include this capability for the HEAD symref if it is
one of the refs being sent.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Clients
MAY use the parameters from this capability to select the
proper initial branch when cloning a repository.</big></p>

<h2>SHALLOW
<a name="SHALLOW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
capability adds &quot;deepen&quot;, &quot;shallow&quot; and
&quot;unshallow&quot; commands to the
fetch&minus;pack/upload&minus;pack protocol so clients can
request shallow clones.</big></p>

<h2>DEEPEN&minus;SINCE
<a name="DEEPEN&minus;SINCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
capability adds &quot;deepen&minus;since&quot; command to
fetch&minus;pack/upload&minus;pack protocol so the client
can request shallow clones that are cut at a specific time,
instead of depth. Internally it&rsquo;s equivalent of doing
&quot;rev&minus;list
&minus;&minus;max&minus;age=&lt;timestamp&gt;&quot; on the
server side. &quot;deepen&minus;since&quot; cannot be used
with &quot;deepen&quot;.</big></p>

<h2>DEEPEN&minus;NOT
<a name="DEEPEN&minus;NOT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
capability adds &quot;deepen&minus;not&quot; command to
fetch&minus;pack/upload&minus;pack protocol so the client
can request shallow clones that are cut at a specific
revision, instead of depth. Internally it&rsquo;s equivalent
of doing &quot;rev&minus;list &minus;&minus;not
&lt;rev&gt;&quot; on the server side.
&quot;deepen&minus;not&quot; cannot be used with
&quot;deepen&quot;, but can be used with
&quot;deepen&minus;since&quot;.</big></p>

<h2>DEEPEN&minus;RELATIVE
<a name="DEEPEN&minus;RELATIVE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If this
capability is requested by the client, the semantics of
&quot;deepen&quot; command is changed. The &quot;depth&quot;
argument is the depth from the current shallow boundary,
instead of the depth from remote refs.</big></p>

<h2>NO&minus;PROGRESS
<a name="NO&minus;PROGRESS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The client
was started with &quot;git clone &minus;q&quot; or
something, and doesn&rsquo;t want that side band 2.
Basically the client just says &quot;I do not wish to
receive stream 2 on sideband, so do not send it to me, and
if you did, I will drop it on the floor anyway&quot;.
However, the sideband channel 3 is still used for error
responses.</big></p>

<h2>INCLUDE&minus;TAG
<a name="INCLUDE&minus;TAG"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
<i>include&minus;tag</i> capability is about sending
annotated tags if we are sending objects they point to. If
we pack an object to the client, and a tag object points
exactly at that object, we pack the tag object too. In
general this allows a client to get all new annotated tags
when it fetches a branch, in a single network
connection.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Clients
MAY always send include&minus;tag, hardcoding it into a
request when the server advertises this capability. The
decision for a client to request include&minus;tag only has
to do with the client&rsquo;s desires for tag data, whether
or not a server had advertised objects in the refs/tags/*
namespace.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Servers
MUST pack the tags if their referrant is packed and the
client has requested include&minus;tags.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Clients
MUST be prepared for the case where a server has ignored
include&minus;tag and has not actually sent tags in the
pack. In such cases the client SHOULD issue a subsequent
fetch to acquire the tags that include&minus;tag would have
otherwise given the client.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The server
SHOULD send include&minus;tag, if it supports it, regardless
of whether or not there are tags available.</big></p>

<h2>REPORT&minus;STATUS
<a name="REPORT&minus;STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
receive&minus;pack process can receive a
<i>report&minus;status</i> capability, which tells it that
the client wants a report of what happened after a packfile
upload and reference update. If the pushing client requests
this capability, after unpacking and updating references the
server will respond with whether the packfile unpacked
successfully and if each reference was updated successfully.
If any of those were not successful, it will send back an
error message. See <b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5) for example
messages.</big></p>

<h2>REPORT&minus;STATUS&minus;V2
<a name="REPORT&minus;STATUS&minus;V2"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Capability
<i>report&minus;status&minus;v2</i> extends capability
<i>report&minus;status</i> by adding new &quot;option&quot;
directives in order to support reference rewritten by the
&quot;proc&minus;receive&quot; hook. The
&quot;proc&minus;receive&quot; hook may handle a command for
a pseudo&minus;reference which may create or update a
reference with different name, new&minus;oid, and
old&minus;oid. While the capability
<i>report&minus;status</i> cannot report for such case. See
<b>gitprotocol-pack</b>(5) for details.</big></p>

<h2>DELETE&minus;REFS
<a name="DELETE&minus;REFS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
server sends back the <i>delete&minus;refs</i> capability,
it means that it is capable of accepting a zero&minus;id
value as the target value of a reference update. It is not
sent back by the client, it simply informs the client that
it can be sent zero&minus;id values to delete
references.</big></p>

<h2>QUIET
<a name="QUIET"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
receive&minus;pack server advertises the <i>quiet</i>
capability, it is capable of silencing human&minus;readable
progress output which otherwise may be shown when processing
the received pack. A send&minus;pack client should respond
with the <i>quiet</i> capability to suppress
server&minus;side progress reporting if the local progress
reporting is also being suppressed (e.g., via <b>push
&minus;q</b>, or if stderr does not go to a tty).</big></p>

<h2>ATOMIC
<a name="ATOMIC"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
server sends the <i>atomic</i> capability it is capable of
accepting atomic pushes. If the pushing client requests this
capability, the server will update the refs in one atomic
transaction. Either all refs are updated or none.</big></p>

<h2>PUSH&minus;OPTIONS
<a name="PUSH&minus;OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
server sends the <i>push&minus;options</i> capability it is
able to accept push options after the update commands have
been sent, but before the packfile is streamed. If the
pushing client requests this capability, the server will
pass the options to the pre&minus; and post&minus; receive
hooks that process this push request.</big></p>

<h2>ALLOW&minus;TIP&minus;SHA1&minus;IN&minus;WANT
<a name="ALLOW&minus;TIP&minus;SHA1&minus;IN&minus;WANT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
upload&minus;pack server advertises this capability,
fetch&minus;pack may send &quot;want&quot; lines with object
names that exist at the server but are not advertised by
upload&minus;pack. For historical reasons, the name of this
capability contains &quot;sha1&quot;. Object names are
always given using the object format negotiated through the
<i>object&minus;format</i> capability.</big></p>

<h2>ALLOW&minus;REACHABLE&minus;SHA1&minus;IN&minus;WANT
<a name="ALLOW&minus;REACHABLE&minus;SHA1&minus;IN&minus;WANT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
upload&minus;pack server advertises this capability,
fetch&minus;pack may send &quot;want&quot; lines with object
names that exist at the server but are not advertised by
upload&minus;pack. For historical reasons, the name of this
capability contains &quot;sha1&quot;. Object names are
always given using the object format negotiated through the
<i>object&minus;format</i> capability.</big></p>

<h2>PUSH&minus;CERT=&lt;NONCE&gt;
<a name="PUSH&minus;CERT=&lt;NONCE&gt;"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
receive&minus;pack server that advertises this capability is
willing to accept a signed push certificate, and asks the
&lt;nonce&gt; to be included in the push certificate. A
send&minus;pack client MUST NOT send a push&minus;cert
packet unless the receive&minus;pack server advertises this
capability.</big></p>

<h2>FILTER
<a name="FILTER"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
upload&minus;pack server advertises the <i>filter</i>
capability, fetch&minus;pack may send &quot;filter&quot;
commands to request a partial clone or partial fetch and
request that the server omit various objects from the
packfile.</big></p>

<h2>SESSION&minus;ID=&lt;SESSION ID&gt;
<a name="SESSION&minus;ID=&lt;SESSION ID&gt;"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The server
may advertise a session ID that can be used to identify this
process across multiple requests. The client may advertise
its own session ID back to the server as well.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Session
IDs should be unique to a given process. They must fit
within a packet&minus;line, and must not contain
non&minus;printable or whitespace characters. The current
implementation uses trace2 session IDs (see
<b><font color="#0000FF">api&minus;trace2</font></b></big>
<font color="#000000">[1] <big>for details), but this may
change and users of the session ID should not rely on this
fact.</big></font></p>
