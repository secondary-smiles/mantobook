<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Methods <br>
GetHomeByName()</b> returns basic user information (a
minimal subset of the full user record), provided a user
name. The information supplied more or less matches what
<b>getpwnam</b>(3) returns: the numeric UID and GID, the
real name, home directory and shell. In addition it returns
a state identifier describing the state the user's home
directory is in, as well as a bus path referring to the bus
object encapsulating the user record and home directory.
This object implements the org.freedesktop.home1.Home
interface documented below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GetHomeByUID()</b>
is similar to <b>GetHomeByName()</b> but acquires the
information based on the numeric UID of the user.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GetUserRecordByName()</b>
is also similar to <b>GetHomeByName()</b> but returns the
full JSON user record data instead of the broken down
records. An additional returned boolean indicates whether
the record is complete or not. A record is considered
complete when its &quot;privileged&quot; section is
included, and incomplete if it was removed (see
<b><font color="#0000FF">JSON User Records</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">for details about the various sections
of a user record). Generally, only privileged clients and
clients running under the identity of the user itself get
access to the &quot;privileged&quot; section and will thus
see complete records.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>GetUserRecordByUID()</b>
is similar to <b>GetUserRecordByName()</b> but returns the
user record matching the specified numeric UID.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>ListHomes()</b>
returns an array of all locally managed users. The array
contains the same fields <b>GetHomeByName()</b> returns:
user name, numeric UID, state, numeric GID, real name, home
directory, shell and bus path of the matching bus
object.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>ActivateHome()</b>
activates (i.e. mounts) the home directory of the specified
user. The second argument shall contain a user record
consisting only of a &quot;secret&quot; section (all other
sections should be stripped, see</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">JSON User Records</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">for details), and should contain only
the secret credentials necessary for unlocking the home
directory. Typically a client would invoke this function
first with an entirely empty record (which is possibly
sufficient if single&minus;factor authentication with a
plugged&minus;in security token is configured), and would
then retry with a record populated with more information,
depending on the returned error code, in case more
credentials are necessary. This function is synchronous and
returns only after the home directory was fully activated
(or the operation failed), which might take some time.
Clients must be prepared for that, and typically should
extend the D&minus;Bus method call timeout accordingly. This
method is equivalent to the <b>Activate()</b> method on the
org.freedesktop.home1.Home interface documented below, but
may be called on the manager object and takes a user name as
additional argument, instead.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>DeactivateHome()</b>
deactivates (i.e. unmounts) the home directory of the
specified user. It is equivalent to the <b>Deactivate()</b>
method on the org.freedesktop.home1.Home interface
documented below.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>RegisterHome()</b>
registers a new home directory locally. It receives the JSON
user record as only argument (which typically excludes the
&quot;secret&quot; section). Registering a home directory
just makes the user record known to the system, it does not
create a home directory or such (which is expected to exist
already, or created later). This operation is useful to
register home directories locally that are not located where
systemd&minus;homed.service would find them
automatically.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>UnregisterHome()</b>
unregisters an existing home directory. It takes a user name
as argument and undoes what <b>RegisterHome()</b> does. It
does not attempt to remove the home directory itself, it
just unregisters it with the local system. Note that if the
home directory is placed where systemd&minus;homed.service
looks for home directories anyway this call will only undo
fixation (see below), but the record will remain known to
systemd&minus;homed.service and be listed among known
records. Since the user record is embedded into the home
directory this operation generally does not discard data
belonging to the user or their record. This method is
equivalent to <b>Unregister()</b> on the
org.freedesktop.home1.Home interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>CreateHome()</b>
registers and creates a new home directory. This takes a
fully specified JSON user record as argument (including the
&quot;secret&quot; section). This registers the user record
locally and creates a home directory matching it, depending
on the settings specified in the record in combination with
local configuration.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>RealizeHome()</b>
creates a home directory whose user record is already
registered locally. This takes a user name plus a user
record consisting only of the &quot;secret&quot; section.
Invoking <b>RegisterHome()</b> followed by
<b>RealizeHome()</b> is mostly equivalent to calling
<b>CreateHome()</b>, except that the latter combines the two
in atomic fashion. This method is equivalent to
<b>Realize()</b> on the org.freedesktop.home1.Home
interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>RemoveHome()</b>
unregisters a user record locally, and removes the home
directory belonging to it, if it is accessible. It takes a
user name as argument. This method is equivalent to
<b>Remove()</b> on the org.freedesktop.home1.Home
interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>FixateHome()</b>
&quot;fixates&quot; an automatically discovered home
directory. systemd&minus;homed.service automatically
discovers home directories dropped in our plugged in and
adds them to the runtime list of user records it manages. A
user record discovered that way may be &quot;fixated&quot;,
in which case it is copied out of the home directory, onto
persistent storage, to fixate the UID/GID assignment of the
record, and extract additional (typically previously
encrypted) user record data from the home directory. A home
directory mus be fixated before it can be logged into. This
method call takes a user name and a JSON user record
consisting only of the &quot;secret&quot; section as
argument. This method is equivalent to <b>Fixate()</b> on
the org.freedesktop.home1.Home interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>AuthenticateHome()</b>
checks passwords or other authentication credentials
associated with the home directory. It takes a user name and
a JSON user record consisting only of the &quot;secret&quot;
section as argument. Note that many of the other method
calls authenticate the user first, in order to execute some
other operation. This method call only authenticates and
executes no further operation. Like <b>ActivateHome()</b> it
is usually first invoked with an empty JSON user record,
which is then populated for subsequent tries with additional
authentication data supplied. This method is equivalent to
<b>Authenticate()</b> on the org.freedesktop.home1.Home
interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>UpdateHome()</b>
updates a locally registered user record. Takes a fully
specified JSON user record as argument (including the
&quot;secret&quot; section). A user with a matching name and
realm must be registered locally already, and the last
change timestamp of the newly supplied record must be newer
than the previously existing user record. Note this
operation updates the user record only, it does not
propagate passwords/authentication tokens from the user
record to the storage back&minus;end, or resizes the storage
back&minus;end. Typically a home directory is first updated,
and then the password of the underlying storage updated
using <b>ChangePasswordHome()</b> as well as the storage
resized using <b>ResizeHome()</b>. This method is equivalent
to <b>Update()</b> on the org.freedesktop.home1.Home
interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>ResizeHome()</b>
resizes the storage associated with a user record. Takes a
user name, a disk size in bytes and a user record consisting
only of the &quot;secret&quot; section as argument. If the
size is specified as <b>UINT64_MAX</b> the storage is
resized to the size already specified in the user record.
Typically, if the user record is updated using
<b>UpdateHome()</b> above this is used to propagate the size
configured there&minus;in down to the underlying storage
back&minus;end. This method is equivalent to <b>Resize()</b>
on the org.freedesktop.home1.Home interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>ChangePasswordHome()</b>
changes the passwords/authentication tokens of a home
directory. Takes a user name, and two JSON user record
objects, each consisting only of the &quot;secret&quot;
section, for the old and for the new
passwords/authentication tokens. If the user record with the
new passwords/authentication token data is specified as
empty the existing user record's settings are propagated
down to the home directory storage. This is typically used
after a user record is updated using <b>UpdateHome()</b> in
order to propagate the secrets/authentication tokens down to
the storage. This method is equivalent to
<b>ChangePassword()</b> on the org.freedesktop.home1.Home
interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>LockHome()</b>
temporarily suspends access to a home directory, flushing
out any cryptographic keys from memory. This is only
supported on some back&minus;ends, and usually done during
system suspend, in order to effectively secure home
directories while the system is sleeping. Takes a user name
as single argument. If an application attempts to access a
home directory while it is locked it will typically freeze
until the home directory is unlocked again. This method is
equivalent to <b>Lock()</b> on the
org.freedesktop.home1.Home interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>UnlockHome()</b>
undoes the effect of <b>LockHome()</b>. Takes a user name
and a user record consisting only of the &quot;secret&quot;
section as arguments. This method is equivalent to
<b>Unlock()</b> on the org.freedesktop.home1.Home
interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>AcquireHome()</b>
activates or unlocks a home directory in a reference counted
mode of operation. Takes a user name and user record
consisting only of &quot;secret&quot; section as argument.
If the home directory is not active yet, it is activated. If
it is currently locked it is unlocked. After completion a
reference to the activation/unlocking of the home directory
is returned via a file descriptor. When the last client
which acquired such a file descriptor closes it the home
directory is automatically deactivated again. This method is
typically invoked when a user logs in, and the file
descriptor is held until the user logs out again, thus
ensuring the user's home directory can be unmounted
automatically again in a robust fashion, when the user logs
out. The third argument is a boolean which indicates whether
the client invoking the call is able to automatically
re&minus;authenticate when the system comes back from
suspending. It should be set by all clients that implement a
secure lock screen running outside of the user's context,
that is brought up when the system comes back from suspend
and can be used to re&minus;acquire the credentials to
unlock the user's home directory. If a home directory has at
least one client with an open reference to the home
directory that does not support this it is not suspended
automatically at system suspend, otherwise it is. This
method is equivalent to <b>Acquire()</b> on the
org.freedesktop.home1.Home interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>RefHome()</b>
is similar to <b>AcquireHome()</b> but takes no user record
with &quot;secret&quot; section, i.e. will take an
additional reference to an already activated/unlocked home
directory without attempting to activate/unlock it itself.
It will fail if the home directory is not already activated.
This method is equivalent to <b>Ref()</b> on the
org.freedesktop.home1.Home interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>ReleaseHome()</b>
releases a home directory again, if all file descriptors
referencing it are already closed, that where acquired
through <b>AcquireHome()</b> or <b>RefHome()</b>. Note that
this call does not actually cause the deactivation of the
home directory (which happens automatically when the last
referencing file descriptor is closed), but is simply a
synchronization mechanism that allows delaying of the user
session's termination until any triggered deactivation is
completed. This method is equivalent to <b>Release()</b> on
the org.freedesktop.home1.Home interface.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>LockAllHomes()</b>
locks all active home directories that only have references
that opted into automatic suspending during system suspend.
This is usually invoked automatically shortly before system
suspend.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>DeactivateAllHomes()</b>
deactivates all home areas that are currently active. This
is usually invoked automatically shortly before system
shutdown.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Rebalance()</b>
synchronously rebalances free disk space between home areas.
This only executes an operation if at least one home area
using the LUKS2 backend is active and has rebalancing
enabled, and is otherwise a NOP.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>Properties</b>
<i><br>
AutoLogin</i> exposes an array of structures consisting of
user name, seat name and object path of an home directory
object. All locally managed users that have the
&quot;autoLogin&quot; field set are listed here, with the
seat name they are associated with. A display manager may
watch this property and pre&minus;fill the login screen with
the users exposed this way.</font></p>

if only the user name is known, it's preferable to use the
