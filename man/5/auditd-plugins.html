<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">auditd-plugins
&minus; realtime event receivers</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>auditd</b>
can multiplex audit events in realtime. It takes audit
events and distributes them to child programs that want to
analyze events in realtime. When the audit daemon receives a
SIGTERM or SIGHUP, it passes that signal to its child
processes so that can reload the configuration or
terminate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The child
programs install a configuration file in a plugins directory
which defaults to <i>/etc/audit/plugins.d</i>. This can be
controlled by a auditd.conf config option <b>plugin_dir</b>
if the admin wished to locate plugins somewhere else. But
auditd will install its plugins in the default location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The plugin
directory will be scanned and every plugin that is active
will be started. If the plugin has a problem and exits, it
will be started a maximum of <b>max_restarts</b> times as
found in auditd.conf.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Config file
names are not allowed to have more than one &rsquo;.&rsquo;
in the name or it will be treated as a backup copy and
skipped. Config file options are given one per line with an
equal sign between the keyword and its value. The available
options are as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><i>active</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="53%">


<p>The options for this are <i>yes</i> or <i>no.</i></p></td>
<td width="25%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i>direction</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The option is dictated by the
plugin. <i>In</i> or <i>out</i> are the only choices. You
cannot make a plugin operate in a way it wasn&rsquo;t
designed just by changing this option. This option is to
give a clue to the event dispatcher about which direction
events flow. NOTE: inbound events are not supported yet.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><i>path</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This is the absolute path to the plugin executable. In
the case of internal plugins, it would be the name of the
plugin.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><i>type</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This tells the dispatcher how the plugin wants to be
run. There is currently only one option, <i>builtin</i> ,
which is the default setting.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><i>args</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This allows you to pass arguments to the child program.
Generally plugins do not take arguments and have their own
config file that instructs them how they should be
configured. At the moment, there is a limit of 2 args.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p><i>format</i></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>The valid options for this are <i>binary</i> and
<i>string. Binary</i> passes the data exactly as the audit
event dispatcher gets it from the audit daemon. The
<i>string</i> option tells the dispatcher to completely
change the event into a string suitable for parsing with the
audit parsing library. The default value is
<i>string.</i></p> </td></tr>

<h2>NOTE
<a name="NOTE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">auditd has an
internal queue to hold events for plugins. (See the
<i>q_depth</i> setting in <i>auditd.conf</i>.) Plugins have
to watch for and dequeue events as fast as possible and
queue them internally if they can&rsquo;t be immediately
processed. If the plugin is not able to dequeue records, the
auditd internal queue will get filled. At any time, as root,
you can run the following to check auditd&rsquo;s
metrics:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">auditctl
--signal cont ; sleep 1 ; cat /var/run/auditd.state</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
auditd&rsquo;s internal queue fills, it cannot dequeue any
events from the kernel backlog. If the kernel&rsquo;s
backlog fills, it looks at the value of backlog_wait_time to
delay all processes that generate an event to see if there
is eventually room to add the event. This will likely be
noticed as slowing down various processes on the machine.
The kernel&rsquo;s audit subsystem can be checked by
running:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">auditctl -s</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When tuning the
audit system&rsquo;s performance, you&rsquo;d want to check
both kernel and auditd metrics and adjust accordingly.</p>

<h2>NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
<a name="NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the audit
daemon starts your plugin, you will be running as root. If
you do not need root privileges, you should change uid/gid
to lower chances of being a target for exploit. If you need
to retain capabilities, using <b>libcap-ng</b> is the
simplest way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your
environment is not going to be clean. You are inheriting
many attributes from auditd itself. You will need to adjust
your <b>signal mask</b>, <b>sigaction</b>, <b>umask</b>, and
<b>environmental variables</b>. Look at the auditd man page
to see which signals auditd used. Plugins are expected to
handle <b>SIGTERM</b> and <b>SIGHUP</b>. You will also
inherit the resource limits of auditd. Note that some of
these resource limits, such as maximum number of open
descriptors, are controlled by systemd. You also inherit
auditd&rsquo;s nice value. You might want to adjust that to
be sure to keep up with incoming audit events.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Auditd will
send events to the plugin on it&rsquo;s <b>stdin</b>. The
plugin has to keep this descriptor empty so that events
don&rsquo;t back up. If you do significant processing of
each event, you should add an internal queue to your design
in order to keep events flowing. The <b>auparse_feed</b>
function is the preferred way to examine whole events if you
need to analyze the contents of the events.</p>
