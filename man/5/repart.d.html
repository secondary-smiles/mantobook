<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">repart.d/*.conf
files describe basic properties of partitions of block
devices of the local system. They may be used to declare
types, names and sizes of partitions that shall exist. The
<b>systemd-repart</b>(8) service reads these files and
attempts to add new partitions currently missing and enlarge
existing partitions according to these definitions.
Operation is generally incremental, i.e. when applied, what
exists already is left intact, and partitions are never
shrunk, moved or deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
definition files are useful for implementing operating
system images that are prepared and delivered with minimally
sized images (for example lacking any state or swap
partitions), and which on first boot automatically take
possession of any remaining disk space following a few basic
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently,
support for partition definition files is only implemented
for GPT partitition tables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Partition files
are generally matched against any partitions already
existing on disk in a simple algorithm: the partition files
are sorted by their filename (ignoring the directory
prefix), and then compared in order against existing
partitions matching the same partition type UUID.
Specifically, the first existing partition with a specific
partition type UUID is assigned the first definition file
with the same partition type UUID, and the second existing
partition with a specific type UUID the second partition
file with the same type UUID, and so on. Any left&minus;over
partition files that have no matching existing partition are
assumed to define new partition that shall be created. Such
partitions are appended to the end of the partition table,
in the order defined by their names utilizing the first
partition slot greater than the highest slot number
currently in use. Any existing partitions that have no
matching partition file are left as they are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that these
definitions may only be used to create and initialize new
partitions or to grow existing ones. In the latter case it
will not grow the contained files systems however; separate
mechanisms, such as <b>systemd-growfs</b>(8) may be used to
grow the file systems inside of these partitions. Partitions
may also be marked for automatic growing via the
<i>GrowFileSystem=</i> setting, in which case the file
system is grown on first mount by tools that respect this
flag. See below for details.</p>

<h2>[PARTITION] SECTION OPTIONS

</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Type=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The GPT partition type UUID to
match. This may be a GPT partition type UUID such as
<b>4f68bce3&minus;e8cd&minus;4db1&minus;96e7&minus;fbcaf984b709</b>,
or an identifier. Architecture specific partition types can
use one of these architecture identifiers: <b>alpha</b>,
<b>arc</b>, <b>arm</b> (32bit), <b>arm64</b> (64bit, aka
aarch64), <b>ia64</b>, <b>loongarch64</b>,
<b>mips&minus;le</b>, <b>mips64&minus;le</b>, <b>parisc</b>,

<b>riscv32</b>, <b>riscv64</b>, <b>s390</b>, <b>s390x</b>,
<b>tilegx</b>, <b>x86</b> (32bit, aka i386) and
<b>x86&minus;64</b> (64bit, aka amd64). The supported
identifiers are:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Table&nbsp;1.&nbsp;GPT
partition type identifiers</b> <br>
This setting defaults to <b>linux&minus;generic</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Most of the
partition type UUIDs listed above are defined in the
<b><font color="#0000FF">Discoverable Partitions
Specification</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Label=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The
textual label to assign to the partition if none is assigned
yet. Note that this setting is not used for matching. It is
also not used when a label is already set for an existing
partition. It is thus only used when a partition is newly
created or when an existing one had a no label set (that is:
an empty label). If not specified a label derived from the
partition type is automatically used. Simple specifier
expansion is supported, see below.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>UUID=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The UUID
to assign to the partition if none is assigned yet. Note
that this setting is not used for matching. It is also not
used when a UUID is already set for an existing partition.
It is thus only used when a partition is newly created or
when an existing one had a all&minus;zero UUID set. If set
to &quot;null&quot;, the UUID is set to all zeroes. If not
specified a UUID derived from the partition type is
automatically used.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Priority=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A numeric
priority to assign to this partition, in the range
&minus;2147483648...2147483647, with smaller values
indicating higher priority, and higher values indicating
smaller priority. This priority is used in case the
configured size constraints on the defined partitions do not
permit fitting all partitions onto the available disk space.
If the partitions do not fit, the highest numeric partition
priority of all defined partitions is determined, and all
defined partitions with this priority are removed from the
list of new partitions to create (which may be multiple, if
the same priority is used for multiple partitions). The
fitting algorithm is then tried again. If the partitions
still do not fit, the now highest numeric partition priority
is determined, and the matching partitions removed too, and
so on. Partitions of a priority of 0 or lower are never
removed. If all partitions with a priority above 0 are
removed and the partitions still do not fit on the device
the operation fails. Note that this priority has no effect
on ordering partitions, for that use the alphabetical order
of the filenames of the partition definition files. Defaults
to 0.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Weight=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A numeric
weight to assign to this partition in the range 0...1000000.
Available disk space is assigned the defined partitions
according to their relative weights (subject to the size
constraints configured with <i>SizeMinBytes=</i>,
<i>SizeMaxBytes=</i>), so that a partition with weight 2000
gets double the space as one with weight 1000, and a
partition with weight 333 a third of that. Defaults to
1000.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
<i>Weight=</i> setting is used to distribute available disk
space in an &quot;elastic&quot; fashion, based on the disk
size and existing partitions. If a partition shall have a
fixed size use both <i>SizeMinBytes=</i> and
<i>SizeMaxBytes=</i> with the same value in order to fixate
the size to one value, in which case the weight has no
effect.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>PaddingWeight=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Similar
to <i>Weight=</i>, but sets a weight for the free space
after the partition (the &quot;padding&quot;). When
distributing available space the weights of all partitions
and all defined padding is summed, and then each partition
and padding gets the fraction defined by its weight.
Defaults to 0, i.e. by default no padding is
applied.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Padding
is useful if empty space shall be left for later additions
or a safety margin at the end of the device or between
partitions.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>SizeMinBytes=</i>,
<i>SizeMaxBytes=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Specifies
minimum and maximum size constraints in bytes. Takes the
usual K, M, G, T, ... suffixes (to the base of 1024). If
<i>SizeMinBytes=</i> is specified the partition is created
at or grown to at least the specified size. If
<i>SizeMaxBytes=</i> is specified the partition is created
at or grown to at most the specified size. The precise size
is determined through the weight value configured with
<i>Weight=</i>, see above. When <i>SizeMinBytes=</i> is set
equal to <i>SizeMaxBytes=</i> the configured weight has no
effect as the partition is explicitly sized to the specified
fixed value. Note that partitions are never created smaller
than 4096 bytes, and since partitions are never shrunk the
previous size of the partition (in case the partition
already exists) is also enforced as lower bound for the new
size. The values should be specified as multiples of 4096
bytes, and are rounded upwards (in case of
<i>SizeMinBytes=</i>) or downwards (in case of
<i>SizeMaxBytes=</i>) otherwise. If the backing device does
not provide enough space to fulfill the constraints placing
the partition will fail. For partitions that shall be
created, depending on the setting of <i>Priority=</i> (see
above) the partition might be dropped and the placing
algorithm restarted. By default a minimum size constraint of
10M and no maximum size constraint is set.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>PaddingMinBytes=</i>,
<i>PaddingMaxBytes=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Specifies
minimum and maximum size constraints in bytes for the free
space after the partition (the &quot;padding&quot;).
Semantics are similar to <i>SizeMinBytes=</i> and
<i>SizeMaxBytes=</i>, except that unlike partition sizes
free space can be shrunk and can be as small as zero. By
default no size constraints on padding are set, so that only
<i>PaddingWeight=</i> determines the size of the padding
applied.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>CopyBlocks=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
path to a regular file, block device node or directory, or
the special value &quot;auto&quot;. If specified and the
partition is newly created, the data from the specified path
is written to the newly created partition, on the block
level. If a directory is specified, the backing block device
of the file system the directory is on is determined, and
the data read directly from that. This option is useful to
efficiently replicate existing file systems onto new
partitions on the block level &mdash; for example to build a
simple OS installer or an OS image builder.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
the special value &quot;auto&quot; is specified, the source
to copy from is automatically picked up from the running
system (or the image specified with
<b>&minus;&minus;image=</b> &mdash; if used). A partition
that matches both the configured partition type (as declared
with <i>Type=</i> described above), and the currently
mounted directory appropriate for that partition type is
determined. For example, if the partition type is set to
&quot;root&quot; the partition backing the root directory
(/) is used as source to copy from &mdash; if its partition
type is set to &quot;root&quot; as well. If the declared
type is &quot;usr&quot; the partition backing /usr/ is used
as source to copy blocks from &mdash; if its partition type
is set to &quot;usr&quot; too. The logic is capable of
automatically tracking down the backing partitions for
encrypted and Verity&minus;enabled volumes.
&quot;CopyBlocks=auto&quot; is useful for implementing
&quot;self&minus;replicating&quot; systems, i.e. systems
that are their own installer.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
file specified here must have a size that is a multiple of
the basic block size 512 and not be empty. If this option is
used, the size allocation algorithm is slightly altered: the
partition is created as least as big as required to fit the
data in, i.e. the data size is an additional minimum size
value taken into consideration for the allocation algorithm,
similar to and in addition to the <i>SizeMin=</i> value
configured above.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option has no effect if the partition it is declared for
already exists, i.e. existing data is never overwritten.
Note that the data is copied in before the partition table
is updated, i.e. before the partition actually is
persistently created. This provides robustness: it is
guaranteed that the partition either doesn't exist or exists
fully populated; it is not possible that the partition
exists but is not or only partially populated.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option cannot be combined with <i>Format=</i> or
<i>CopyFiles=</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Format=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
file system name, such as &quot;ext4&quot;,
&quot;btrfs&quot;, &quot;xfs&quot;, &quot;vfat&quot;,
&quot;erofs&quot;, &quot;squashfs&quot; or the special value
&quot;swap&quot;. If specified and the partition is newly
created it is formatted with the specified file system (or
as swap device). The file system UUID and label are
automatically derived from the partition UUID and label. If
this option is used, the size allocation algorithm is
slightly altered: the partition is created as least as big
as required for the minimal file system of the specified
type (or 4KiB if the minimal size is not known).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option has no effect if the partition already
exists.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Similarly
to the behaviour of <i>CopyBlocks=</i>, the file system is
formatted before the partition is created, ensuring that the
partition only ever exists with a fully initialized file
system.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option cannot be combined with
<i>CopyBlocks=</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>CopyFiles=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
pair of colon separated absolute file system paths. The
first path refers to a source file or directory on the host,
the second path refers to a target in the file system of the
newly created partition and formatted file system. This
setting may be used to copy files or directories from the
host into the file system that is created due to the
<i>Format=</i> option. If <i>CopyFiles=</i> is used without
<i>Format=</i> specified explicitly, &quot;Format=&quot;
with a suitable default is implied (currently
&quot;ext4&quot;, but this may change in the future). This
option may be used multiple times to copy multiple files or
directories from host into the newly formatted file system.
The colon and second path may be omitted in which case the
source path is also used as the target path (relative to the
root of the newly created file system). If the source path
refers to a directory it is copied recursively.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option has no effect if the partition already exists: it
cannot be used to copy additional files into an existing
partition, it may only be used to populate a file system
created anew.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
copy operation is executed before the file system is
registered in the partition table, thus ensuring that a file
system populated this way only ever exists fully
initialized.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that <i>CopyFiles=</i> will skip copying files that aren't
supported by the target filesystem (e.g symlinks, fifos,
sockets and devices on vfat). When an unsupported file type
is encountered, repart will skip copying this file and write
a log message about it.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that <b>systemd&minus;repart</b> does not change the
UIDs/GIDs of any copied files and directories. When running
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b> as an unprivileged user to build
an image of files and directories owned by the same user,
you can run <b>systemd&minus;repart</b> in a user namespace
with the current user mapped to the root user to make sure
the files and directories in the image are owned by the root
user.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that when populating XFS filesystems with
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b> and loop devices are not
available, populating XFS filesystems with files containing
spaces, tabs or newlines will fail due to limitations of
mkfs.xfs's protofile format.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option cannot be combined with
<i>CopyBlocks=</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
<b>systemd-repart</b>(8) is invoked with the
<b>&minus;&minus;image=</b> or <b>&minus;&minus;root=</b>
command line switches the source paths specified are taken
relative to the specified root directory or disk image
root.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>MakeDirectories=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes one
or more absolute paths, separated by whitespace, each
declaring a directory to create within the new file system.
Behaviour is similar to <i>CopyFiles=</i>, but instead of
copying in a set of files this just creates the specified
directories with the default mode of 0755 owned by the root
user and group, plus all their parent directories (with the
same ownership and access mode). To configure directories
with different ownership or access mode, use
<i>CopyFiles=</i> and specify a source tree to copy
containing appropriately owned/configured directories. This
option may be used more than once to create multiple
directories. When <i>CopyFiles=</i> and
<i>MakeDirectories=</i> are used together the former is
applied first. If a directory listed already exists no
operation is executed (in particular, the ownership/access
mode of the directories is left as is).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
primary usecase for this option is to create a minimal set
of directories that may be mounted over by other partitions
contained in the same disk image. For example, a disk image
where the root file system is formatted at first boot might
want to automatically pre&minus;create /usr/ in it this way,
so that the &quot;usr&quot; partition may over&minus;mount
it.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Consider
using <b>systemd-tmpfiles</b>(8) with its
<b>&minus;&minus;image=</b> option to pre&minus;create
other, more complex directory hierarchies (as well as other
inodes) with fine&minus;grained control of ownership, access
modes and other file attributes.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Encrypt=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes one
of &quot;off&quot;, &quot;key&minus;file&quot;,
&quot;tpm2&quot; and &quot;key&minus;file+tpm2&quot;
(alternatively, also accepts a boolean value, which is
mapped to &quot;off&quot; when false, and
&quot;key&minus;file&quot; when true). Defaults to
&quot;off&quot;. If not &quot;off&quot; the partition will
be formatted with a LUKS2 superblock, before the blocks
configured with <i>CopyBlocks=</i> are copied in or the file
system configured with <i>Format=</i> is created.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
LUKS2 UUID is automatically derived from the partition UUID
in a stable fashion. If &quot;key&minus;file&quot; or
&quot;key&minus;file+tpm2&quot; is used, a key is added to
the LUKS2 superblock, configurable with the
<b>&minus;&minus;key&minus;file=</b> option to
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b>. If &quot;tpm2&quot; or
&quot;key&minus;file+tpm2&quot; is used, a key is added to
the LUKS2 superblock that is enrolled to the local TPM2
chip, as configured with the
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;device=</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;pcrs=</b> options to
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">When
used this slightly alters the size allocation logic as the
implicit, minimal size limits of <i>Format=</i> and
<i>CopyBlocks=</i> are increased by the space necessary for
the LUKS2 superblock (see above).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option has no effect if the partition already
exists.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Verity=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes one
of &quot;off&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;hash&quot; or
&quot;signature&quot;. Defaults to &quot;off&quot;. If set
to &quot;off&quot; or &quot;data&quot;, the partition is
populated with content as specified by <i>CopyBlocks=</i> or
<i>CopyFiles=</i>. If set to &quot;hash&quot;, the partition
will be populated with verity hashes from the matching
verity data partition. If set to &quot;signature&quot;, the
partition will be populated with a JSON object containing a
signature of the verity root hash of the matching verity
hash partition.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">A
matching verity partition is a partition with the same
verity match key (as configured with
<i>VerityMatchKey=</i>).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
not explicitly configured, the data partition's UUID will be
set to the first 128 bits of the verity root hash.
Similarly, if not configured, the hash partition's UUID will
be set to the final 128 bits of the verity root hash. The
verity root hash itself will be included in the output of
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
option has no effect if the partition already
exists.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Usage
of this option in combination with <i>Encrypt=</i> is not
supported.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">For
each unique <i>VerityMatchKey=</i> value, a single verity
data partition (&quot;Verity=data&quot;) and a single verity

defined.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>VerityMatchKey=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
short, user&minus;chosen identifier string. This setting is
used to find sibling verity partitions for the current
verity partition. See the description for
<i>Verity=</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>FactoryReset=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. If specified the partition is marked for
removal during a factory reset operation. This functionality
is useful to implement schemes where images can be reset
into their original state by removing partitions and
creating them anew. Defaults to off.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Flags=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
the 64bit GPT partition flags field to set for the partition
when creating it. This option has no effect if the partition
already exists. If not specified the flags values is set to
all zeroes, except for the three bits that can also be
configured via <i>NoAuto=</i>, <i>ReadOnly=</i> and
<i>GrowFileSystem=</i>; see below for details on the

without setting any of the other bits, and may be set via
<i>Flags=</i> too, see above.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
<i>Flags=</i> is used in conjunction with one or more of
<i>NoAuto=</i>/<i>ReadOnly=</i>/<i>GrowFileSystem=</i> the
latter control the value of the relevant flags, i.e. the
high&minus;level settings
<i>NoAuto=</i>/<i>ReadOnly=</i>/<i>GrowFileSystem=</i>
override the relevant bits of the low&minus;level setting
<i>Flags=</i>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that the three flags affect only automatic partition
mounting, as implemented by
<b>systemd-gpt-auto-generator</b>(8) or the
<b>&minus;&minus;image=</b> option of various commands (such
as <b>systemd-nspawn</b>(1)). It has no effect on explicit
mounts, such as those done via <b>mount</b>(8) or
<b>fstab</b>(5).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
both bit 50 and 59 are set for a partition (i.e. the
partition is marked both read&minus;only and marked for file
system growing) the latter is typically without effect: the
read&minus;only flag takes precedence in most tools reading
these flags, and since growing the file system involves
writing to the partition it is consequently
ignored.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>NoAuto=</i>
defaults to off. <i>ReadOnly=</i> defaults to on for Verity
partition types, and off for all others.
<i>GrowFileSystem=</i> defaults to on for all partition
types that support it, except if the partition is marked
read&minus;only (and thus effectively, defaults to off for
Verity partitions).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>SplitName=</i></font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Configures
the suffix to append to split artifacts when the
<b>&minus;&minus;split</b> option of
<b>systemd&minus;repart</b> is used. Simple specifier
expansion is supported, see below. Defaults to
&quot;%t&quot;. To disable split artifact generation for a
partition, set <i>SplitName=</i> to
&quot;&minus;&quot;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Minimize=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes one
of &quot;off&quot;, &quot;best&quot;, and &quot;guess&quot;
(alternatively, also accepts a boolean value, which is
mapped to &quot;off&quot; when false, and &quot;best&quot;
when true). Defaults to &quot;off&quot;. If set to
&quot;best&quot;, the partition will have the minimal size
required to store the sources configured with
<i>CopyFiles=</i>. &quot;best&quot; is currently only
supported for read&minus;only filesystems. If set to
&quot;guess&quot;, the partition is created at least as big
as required to store the sources configured with
<i>CopyFiles=</i>. Note that unless the filesystem is a
read&minus;only filesystem, <b>systemd&minus;repart</b> will
have to populate the filesystem twice to guess the minimal
required size, so enabling this option might slow down
repart when populating large partitions.</font></p>
