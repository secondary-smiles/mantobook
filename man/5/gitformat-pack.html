<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Git pack
format is now Git stores most of its primary repository
data. Over the lietime af a repository loose objects (if
any) and smaller packs are consolidated into larger pack(s).
See <b>git-gc</b>(1) and <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pack format
is also used over&minus;the&minus;wire, see e.g.
<b>gitprotocol-v2</b>(5), as well as being a part of other
container formats in the case of
<b>gitformat-bundle</b>(5).</p>

<h2>CHECKSUMS AND OBJECT IDS
<a name="CHECKSUMS AND OBJECT IDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a repository
using the traditional SHA&minus;1, pack checksums, index
checksums, and object IDs (object names) mentioned below are
all computed using SHA&minus;1. Similarly, in SHA&minus;256
repositories, these values are computed using
SHA&minus;256.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A header
appears at the beginning and consists of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">4&minus;byte

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">4&minus;byte

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Observation: we

more than 4G objects in a pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The

which looks like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">(undeltified

base object name if OBJ_REF_DELTA or a negative relative
<br>
offset from the delta object's position in the pack if this
<br>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Observation:
length of each object is encoded in a variable <br>
length format and is not constrained to 32&minus;bit or
anything.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
trailer records a pack checksum of all of the above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Object

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Type 5 is
reserved for future expansion. Type 0 is invalid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Size
encoding</b> <br>
This document uses the following &quot;size encoding&quot;
of non&minus;negative integers: From each byte, the seven
least significant bits are used to form the resulting
integer. As long as the most significant bit is 1, this
process continues; the byte with MSB 0 provides the last
seven bits. The seven&minus;bit chunks are concatenated.
Later values are more significant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This size
encoding should not be confused with the &quot;offset
encoding&quot;, which is also used in this document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Deltified
representation</b> <br>
Conceptually there are only four object types: commit, tree,
tag and blob. However to save space, an object could be
stored as a &quot;delta&quot; of another &quot;base&quot;
object. These representations are assigned new types
ofs&minus;delta and ref&minus;delta, which is only valid in
a pack file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both
ofs&minus;delta and ref&minus;delta store the
&quot;delta&quot; to be applied to another object (called
<i>base object</i>) to reconstruct the object. The
difference between them is, ref&minus;delta directly encodes
base object name. If the base object is in the same pack,
ofs&minus;delta encodes the offset of the base object in the
pack instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The base object
could also be deltified if it&rsquo;s in the same pack.
Ref&minus;delta can also refer to an object outside the pack
(i.e. the so&minus;called &quot;thin pack&quot;). When
stored on disk however, the pack should be self contained to
avoid cyclic dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The delta data
starts with the size of the base object and the size of the
object to be reconstructed. These sizes are encoded using
the size encoding from above. The remainder of the delta
data is a sequence of instructions to reconstruct the object
from the base object. If the base object is deltified, it
must be converted to canonical form first. Each instruction
appends more and more data to the target object until
it&rsquo;s complete. There are two supported instructions so
far: one for copy a byte range from the source object and
one for inserting new data embedded in the instruction
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each
instruction has variable length. Instruction type is
determined by the seventh bit of the first octet. The
following diagrams follow the convention in RFC 1951
(Deflate compressed data format).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Instruction

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
instruction format to copy a byte range from the source
object. It encodes the offset to copy from and the number of
bytes to copy. Offset and size are in little&minus;endian
order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All offset and
size bytes are optional. This is to reduce the instruction
size when encoding small offsets or sizes. The first seven
bits in the first octet determines which of the next seven
octets is present. If bit zero is set, offset1 is present.
If bit one is set offset2 is present and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
more compact instruction does not change offset and size
encoding. For example, if only offset2 is omitted like
below, offset3 still contains bits 16&minus;23. It does not
become offset2 and contains bits 8&minus;15 even if
it&rsquo;s right next to offset1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In its most
compact form, this instruction only takes up one byte (0x80)
with both offset and size omitted, which will have default
values zero. There is another exception: size zero is
automatically converted to 0x10000.</p>

unless <br>
otherwise specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">CHUNK DATA:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Packfile Names
(ID: {'P', 'N', 'A', 'M'}) <br>
Stores the packfile names as concatenated,
null&minus;terminated strings. <br>
Packfiles must be listed in lexicographic order for fast
lookups by <br>
name. This is the only chunk not guaranteed to be a multiple
of four <br>
bytes in length, so should be the last chunk for alignment
reasons.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">OID Fanout (ID:
{'O', 'I', 'D', 'F'}) <br>
The ith entry, F[i], stores the number of OIDs with first
<br>
byte at most i. Thus F[255] stores the total <br>
number of objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">OID Lookup (ID:
{'O', 'I', 'D', 'L'}) <br>
The OIDs for all objects in the MIDX are stored in
lexicographic <br>
order in this chunk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Object Offsets
(ID: {'O', 'O', 'F', 'F'}) <br>
Stores two 4&minus;byte values for every object. <br>
1: The pack&minus;int&minus;id for the pack storing this
object. <br>
2: The offset within the pack. <br>
If all offsets are less than 2^32, then the large offset
chunk <br>
will not exist and offsets are stored as in IDX v1. <br>
If there is at least one offset value larger than
2^32&minus;1, then <br>
the large offset chunk must exist, and offsets larger than
<br>
2^31&minus;1 must be stored in it instead. If the large
offset chunk <br>
exists and the 31st bit is on, then removing that bit
reveals <br>
the row in the large offsets containing the 8&minus;byte
offset of <br>
this object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[Optional]
Object Large Offsets (ID: {'L', 'O', 'F', 'F'}) <br>
8&minus;byte offsets into large packfiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[Optional]
Bitmap pack order (ID: {'R', 'I', 'D', 'X'}) <br>
A list of MIDX positions (one per object in the MIDX,
num_objects in <br>
total, each a 4&minus;byte unsigned integer in network byte
order), sorted <br>
according to their relative bitmap/pseudo&minus;pack
positions.</p>

<h2>MULTI&minus;PACK&minus;INDEX REVERSE INDEXES
<a name="MULTI&minus;PACK&minus;INDEX REVERSE INDEXES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similar to the
pack&minus;based reverse index, the multi&minus;pack index
can also be used to generate a reverse index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of
mapping between offset, pack&minus;, and index position,
this reverse index maps between an object&rsquo;s position
within the MIDX, and that object&rsquo;s position within a
pseudo&minus;pack that the MIDX describes (i.e., the ith
entry of the multi&minus;pack reverse index holds the MIDX
position of ith object in pseudo&minus;pack order).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To clarify the
difference between these orderings, consider a
multi&minus;pack reachability bitmap (which does not yet
exist, but is what we are building towards here). Each bit
needs to correspond to an object in the MIDX, and so we need
an efficient mapping from bit position to MIDX position.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One solution is
to let bits occupy the same position in the oid&minus;sorted
index stored by the MIDX. But because oids are effectively
random, their resulting reachability bitmaps would have no
locality, and thus compress poorly. (This is the reason that
single&minus;pack bitmaps use the pack ordering, and not the
.idx ordering, for the same purpose.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So we&rsquo;d
like to define an ordering for the whole MIDX based around
pack ordering, which has far better locality (and thus
compresses more efficiently). We can think of a
pseudo&minus;pack created by the concatenation of all of the
packs in the MIDX. E.g., if we had a MIDX with three packs
(a, b, c), with 10, 15, and 20 objects respectively, we can
imagine an ordering of the objects like:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">|a,0|a,1|...|a,9|b,0|b,1|...|b,14|c,0|c,1|...|c,19|</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where the
ordering of the packs is defined by the MIDX&rsquo;s pack
list, and then the ordering of objects within each pack is
the same as the order in the actual packfile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Given the list
of packs and their counts of objects, you can na&iuml;vely
reconstruct that pseudo&minus;pack ordering (e.g., the
object at position 27 must be (c,1) because packs
&quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; consumed 25 of the slots).
But there&rsquo;s a catch. Objects may be duplicated between
packs, in which case the MIDX only stores one pointer to the
object (and thus we&rsquo;d want only one slot in the
bitmap).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Callers could
handle duplicates themselves by reading objects in order of
their bit&minus;position, but that&rsquo;s linear in the
number of objects, and much too expensive for ordinary
bitmap lookups. Building a reverse index solves this, since
it is the logical inverse of the index, and that index has
already removed duplicates. But, building a reverse index on
the fly can be expensive. Since we already have an
on&minus;disk format for pack&minus;based reverse indexes,
let&rsquo;s reuse it for the MIDX&rsquo;s pseudo&minus;pack,
too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Objects from
the MIDX are ordered as follows to string together the
pseudo&minus;pack. Let <b>pack(o)</b> return the pack from
which <b>o</b> was selected by the MIDX, and define an
ordering of packs based on their numeric ID (as stored by
the MIDX). Let <b>offset(o)</b> return the object offset of
<b>o</b> within <b>pack(o)</b>. Then, compare <b>o1</b> and
<b>o2</b> as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If one
of <b>pack(o1)</b> and <b>pack(o2)</b> is preferred and the
other is not, then the preferred one sorts first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(This is a
detail that allows the MIDX bitmap to determine which pack
should be used by the pack&minus;reuse mechanism, since it
can ask the MIDX for the pack containing the object at bit
position 0).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If
<b>pack(o1) &ne; pack(o2)</b>, then sort the two objects in
descending order based on the pack ID.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Otherwise, <b>pack(o1) = pack(o2)</b>, and the objects are
sorted in pack&minus;order (i.e., <b>o1</b> sorts ahead of
<b>o2</b> exactly when <b>offset(o1) &lt;
offset(o2)</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In short, a
MIDX&rsquo;s pseudo&minus;pack is the de&minus;duplicated
concatenation of objects in packs stored by the MIDX, laid
out in pack order, and the packs arranged in MIDX order
(with the preferred pack coming first).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
MIDX&rsquo;s reverse index is stored in the optional
<i>RIDX</i> chunk within the MIDX itself.</p>

<h2>CRUFT PACKS
<a name="CRUFT PACKS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The cruft packs
feature offer an alternative to Git&rsquo;s traditional
mechanism of removing unreachable objects. This document
provides an overview of Git&rsquo;s pruning mechanism, and
how a cruft pack can be used instead to accomplish the
same.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Background</b>
<br>
To remove unreachable objects from your repository, Git
offers <b>git repack &minus;Ad</b> (see
<b>git-repack</b>(1)). Quoting from the documentation:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[...]
unreachable objects in a previous pack become loose,
unpacked objects, <br>
instead of being left in the old pack. [...] loose
unreachable objects will be <br>
pruned according to normal expiry rules with the next 'git
gc' invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unreachable
objects aren&rsquo;t removed immediately, since doing so
could race with an incoming push which may reference an
object which is about to be deleted. Instead, those
unreachable objects are stored as loose objects and stay
that way until they are older than the expiration window, at
which point they are removed by <b>git-prune</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Git must store
these unreachable objects loose in order to keep track of
their per&minus;object mtimes. If these unreachable objects
were written into one big pack, then either freshening that
pack (because an object contained within it was
re&minus;written) or creating a new pack of unreachable
objects would cause the pack&rsquo;s mtime to get updated,
and the objects within it would never leave the expiration
window. Instead, objects are stored loose in order to keep
track of the individual object mtimes and avoid a situation
where all cruft objects are freshened at once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can lead
to undesirable situations when a repository contains many
unreachable objects which have not yet left the grace
period. Having large directories in the shards of
<b>.git/objects</b> can lead to decreased performance in the
repository. But given enough unreachable objects, this can
lead to inode starvation and degrade the performance of the
whole system. Since we can never pack those objects, these
repositories often take up a large amount of disk space,
since we can only zlib compress them, but not store them in
delta chains.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Cruft
packs</b> <br>
A cruft pack eliminates the need for storing unreachable
objects in a loose state by including the per&minus;object
mtimes in a separate file alongside a single pack containing
all loose objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A cruft pack is
written by <b>git repack &minus;&minus;cruft</b> when
generating a new pack. <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1)'s
<b>&minus;&minus;cruft</b> option. Note that <b>git repack
&minus;&minus;cruft</b> is a classic
all&minus;into&minus;one repack, meaning that everything in
the resulting pack is reachable, and everything else is
unreachable. Once written, the <b>&minus;&minus;cruft</b>
option instructs <b>git repack</b> to generate another pack
containing only objects not packed in the previous step
(which equates to packing all unreachable objects together).
This progresses as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. Enumerate
every object, marking any object which is (a) not contained
in a kept&minus;pack, and (b) whose mtime is within the
grace period as a traversal tip.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. Perform a
reachability traversal based on the tips gathered in the
previous step, adding every object along the way to the
pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. Write the
pack out, along with a <b>.mtimes</b> file that records the
per&minus;object timestamps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This mode is
invoked internally by <b>git-repack</b>(1) when instructed
to write a cruft pack. Crucially, the set of in&minus;core
kept packs is exactly the set of packs which will not be
deleted by the repack; in other words, they contain all of
the repository&rsquo;s reachable objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a
repository already has a cruft pack, <b>git repack
&minus;&minus;cruft</b> typically only adds objects to it.
An exception to this is when <b>git repack</b> is given the
<b>&minus;&minus;cruft&minus;expiration</b> option, which
allows the generated cruft pack to omit expired objects
instead of waiting for <b>git-gc</b>(1) to expire those
objects later on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
<b>git-gc</b>(1) that is typically responsible for removing
expired unreachable objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Caution for
mixed&minus;version environments</b> <br>
Repositories that have cruft packs in them will continue to
work with any older version of Git. Note, however, that
previous versions of Git which do not understand the
<b>.mtimes</b> file will use the cruft pack&rsquo;s mtime as
the mtime for all of the objects in it. In other words, do
not expect older (pre&minus;cruft pack) versions of Git to
interpret or even read the contents of the <b>.mtimes</b>
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
having mixed versions of Git GC&minus;ing the same
repository can lead to unreachable objects never being
completely pruned. This can happen under the following
circumstances:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; An older
version of Git running GC explodes the contents of an
existing cruft pack loose, using the cruft pack&rsquo;s
mtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; A newer
version running GC collects those loose objects into a cruft
pack, where the .mtime file reflects the loose
object&rsquo;s actual mtimes, but the cruft pack mtime is
&quot;now&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Repeating this
process will lead to unreachable objects not getting pruned
as a result of repeatedly resetting the objects' mtimes to
the present time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
GC&minus;ing repositories in a mixed version environment,
consider omitting the <b>&minus;&minus;cruft</b> option when
using <b>git-repack</b>(1) and <b>git-gc</b>(1), and leaving
the <b>gc.cruftPacks</b> configuration unset until all
writers understand cruft packs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Alternatives</b>
<br>
Notable alternatives to this design include:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
location of the per&minus;object mtime data, and</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Storing
unreachable objects in multiple cruft packs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the location
of mtime data, a new auxiliary file tied to the pack was
chosen to avoid complicating the <b>.idx</b> format. If the
<b>.idx</b> format were ever to gain support for optional
chunks of data, it may make sense to consolidate the
<b>.mtimes</b> format into the <b>.idx</b> itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Storing
unreachable objects among multiple cruft packs (e.g.,
creating a new cruft pack during each repacking operation
including only unreachable objects which aren&rsquo;t
already stored in an earlier cruft pack) is significantly
more complicated to construct, and so aren&rsquo;t pursued
here. The obvious drawback to the current implementation is
that the entire cruft pack must be re&minus;written from
scratch.</p>
