<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Variable
names</b> <br>
Perl has three built-in data types: scalars, arrays of
scalars, and associative arrays of scalars, known as
&quot;hashes&quot;. A scalar is a single string (of any
size, limited only by the available memory), number, or a
reference to something (which will be discussed in perlref).
Normal arrays are ordered lists of scalars indexed by
number, starting with 0. Hashes are unordered collections of
scalar values indexed by their associated string key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Values are
usually referred to by name, or through a named reference.
The first character of the name tells you to what sort of
data structure it refers. The rest of the name tells you the
particular value to which it refers. Usually this name is a
single <i>identifier</i>, that is, a string beginning with a
letter or underscore, and containing letters, underscores,
and digits. In some cases, it may be a chain of identifiers,
separated by &quot;::&quot; (or by the slightly archaic
&quot;'&quot;); all but the last are interpreted as names of
packages, to locate the namespace in which to look up the
final identifier (see &quot;Packages&quot; in perlmod for
details). For a more in-depth discussion on identifiers, see
&quot;Identifier parsing&quot;. It&rsquo;s possible to
substitute for a simple identifier, an expression that
produces a reference to the value at runtime. This is
described in more detail below and in perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl also has
its own built-in variables whose names don&rsquo;t follow
these rules. They have strange names so they don&rsquo;t
accidentally collide with one of your normal variables.
Strings that match parenthesized parts of a regular
expression are saved under names containing only digits
after the &quot;$&quot; (see perlop and perlre). In
addition, several special variables that provide windows
into the inner working of Perl have names containing
punctuation characters. These are documented in perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Scalar values
are always named with &rsquo;$&rsquo;, even when referring
to a scalar that is part of an array or a hash. The
&rsquo;$&rsquo; symbol works semantically like the English
word &quot;the&quot; in that it indicates a single value is
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$days # the
simple scalar value &quot;days&quot; <br>
$days[28] # the 29th element of array @days <br>
$days{'Feb'} # the 'Feb' value from hash %days <br>
$#days # the last index of array @days</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Entire arrays
(and slices of arrays and hashes) are denoted by
&rsquo;@&rsquo;, which works much as the word
&quot;these&quot; or &quot;those&quot; does in English, in
that it indicates multiple values are expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@days #
($days[0], $days[1],... $days[n]) <br>
@days[3,4,5] # same as ($days[3],$days[4],$days[5]) <br>
@days{'a','c'} # same as ($days{'a'},$days{'c'})</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Entire hashes
are denoted by &rsquo;%&rsquo;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%days # (key1,
val1, key2, val2 ...)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
subroutines are named with an initial &rsquo;&amp;&rsquo;,
though this is optional when unambiguous, just as the word
&quot;do&quot; is often redundant in English. Symbol table
entries can be named with an initial &rsquo;*&rsquo;, but
you don&rsquo;t really care about that yet (if ever
:&minus;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Every variable
type has its own namespace, as do several non-variable
identifiers. This means that you can, without fear of
conflict, use the same name for a scalar variable, an array,
or a hash--or, for that matter, for a filehandle, a
directory handle, a subroutine name, a format name, or a
label. This means that $foo and @foo are two different
variables. It also means that $foo[1] is a part of @foo, not
a part of $foo. This may seem a bit weird, but that&rsquo;s
okay, because it is weird.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because
variable references always start with &rsquo;$&rsquo;,
&rsquo;@&rsquo;, or &rsquo;%&rsquo;, the
&quot;reserved&quot; words aren&rsquo;t in fact reserved
with respect to variable names. They <i>are</i> reserved
with respect to labels and filehandles, however, which
don&rsquo;t have an initial special character. You
can&rsquo;t have a filehandle named &quot;log&quot;, for
instance. Hint: you could say
&quot;open(LOG,'logfile')&quot; rather than
&quot;open(log,'logfile')&quot;. Using uppercase filehandles
also improves readability and protects you from conflict
with future reserved words. Case <i>is</i>
significant&minus;&minus;&quot; <small>FOO&quot;,</small>
&quot;Foo&quot;, and &quot;foo&quot; are all different
names. Names that start with a letter or underscore may also
contain digits and underscores.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
to replace such an alphanumeric name with an expression that
returns a reference to the appropriate type. For a
description of this, see perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Names that
start with a digit may contain only more digits. Names that
do not start with a letter, underscore, digit or a caret are
limited to one character, e.g., $% or $$. (Most of these one
character names have a predefined significance to Perl. For
instance, $$ is the current process id. And all such names
are reserved for Perl&rsquo;s possible use.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Identifier
parsing</b> <br>
Up until Perl 5.18, the actual rules of what a valid
identifier was were a bit fuzzy. However, in general,
anything defined here should work on previous versions of
Perl, while the opposite -- edge cases that work in previous
versions, but aren&rsquo;t defined here -- probably
won&rsquo;t work on newer versions. As an important side
note, please note that the following only applies to
bareword identifiers as found in Perl source code, not
identifiers introduced through symbolic references, which
have much fewer restrictions. If working under the effect of
the &quot;use utf8;&quot; pragma, the following rules
apply:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/ (?[ (
\p{Word} &amp; \p{XID_Start} ) + [_] ]) <br>
(?[ ( \p{Word} &amp; \p{XID_Continue} ) ]) * /x</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That is, a
&quot;start&quot; character followed by any number of
&quot;continue&quot; characters. Perl requires every
character in an identifier to also match &quot;\w&quot;
(this prevents some problematic cases); and Perl
additionally accepts identifier names beginning with an
underscore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If not under
&quot;use utf8&quot;, the source is treated as <small>ASCII
+ 128</small> extra generic characters, and identifiers
should match</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/ (?aa) (?!\d)
\w+ /x</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That is, any
word character in the <small>ASCII</small> range, as long as
the first character is not a digit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
package separators in Perl: A double colon (&quot;::&quot;)
and a single quote (&quot;'&quot;). Normal identifiers can
start or end with a double colon, and can contain several
parts delimited by double colons. Single quotes have similar
rules, but with the exception that they are not legal at the
end of an identifier: That is, &quot;$'foo&quot; and
&quot;$foo'bar&quot; are legal, but &quot;$foo'bar'&quot; is
not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
if the identifier is preceded by a sigil -- that is, if the
identifier is part of a variable name -- it may optionally
be enclosed in braces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While you can
mix double colons with singles quotes, the quotes must come
after the colons: &quot;$::::'foo&quot; and
&quot;$foo::'bar&quot; are legal, but &quot;$::'::foo&quot;
and &quot;$foo'::bar&quot; are not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Put together, a
grammar to match a basic identifier becomes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/ <br>
(?(DEFINE) <br>
(?&lt;variable&gt; <br>
(?&amp;sigil) <br>
(?: <br>
(?&amp;normal_identifier) <br>
| \{ \s* (?&amp;normal_identifier) \s* \} <br>
) <br>
) <br>
(?&lt;normal_identifier&gt; <br>
(?: :: )* '? <br>
(?&amp;basic_identifier) <br>
(?: (?= (?: :: )+ '? | (?: :: )* ' )
(?&amp;normal_identifier) )? <br>
(?: :: )* <br>
) <br>
(?&lt;basic_identifier&gt; <br>
# is use utf8 on? <br>
(?(?{ (caller(0))[8] &amp; $utf8::hint_bits }) <br>
(?&amp;Perl_XIDS) (?&amp;Perl_XIDC)* <br>
| (?aa) (?!\d) \w+ <br>
) <br>
) <br>
(?&lt;sigil&gt; [&amp;*\$\@\%]) <br>
(?&lt;Perl_XIDS&gt; (?[ ( \p{Word} &amp; \p{XID_Start} ) +
[_] ]) ) <br>
(?&lt;Perl_XIDC&gt; (?[ \p{Word} &amp; \p{XID_Continue} ]) )
<br>
) <br>
/x</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Meanwhile,
special identifiers don&rsquo;t follow the above rules; For
the most part, all of the identifiers in this category have
a special meaning given by Perl. Because they have special
parsing rules, these generally can&rsquo;t be
fully-qualified. They come in six forms (but don&rsquo;t use
forms 5 and 6):</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A sigil, followed solely by digits matching
&quot;\p{POSIX_Digit}&quot;, like $0, $1, or $10000.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A sigil followed by a single character matching the
&quot;\p{POSIX_Punct}&quot; property, like $! or
&quot;%+&quot;, except the character &quot;{&quot;
doesn&rsquo;t work.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A sigil, followed by a caret and any one of the
characters &quot;[][A&minus;Z^_?\]&quot;, like $^V or
$^].</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>4.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Similar to the above, a sigil, followed by bareword text
in braces, where the first character is a caret. The next
character is any one of the characters
&quot;[][A&minus;Z^_?\]&quot;, followed by
<small>ASCII</small> word characters. An example is
&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>5.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A sigil, followed by any single character in the range
&quot;[\xA1&minus;\xAC\xAE&minus;\xFF]&quot; when not under
&quot;use&nbsp;utf8&quot;. (Under &quot;use&nbsp;utf8&quot;,
the normal identifier rules given earlier in this section
apply.) Use of non-graphic characters (the C1 controls, the
NO-BREAK <small>SPACE,</small> and the <small>SOFT
HYPHEN</small> ) has been disallowed since v5.26.0. The use
of the other characters is unwise, as these are all reserved
to have special meaning to Perl, and none of them currently
do have special meaning, though this could change without
notice.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that an
implication of this form is that there are identifiers only
legal under &quot;use&nbsp;utf8&quot;, and vice-versa, for
example the identifier &quot;$etat&quot; is legal under
&quot;use&nbsp;utf8&quot;, but is otherwise considered to be
the single character variable &quot;$e&quot; followed by the
bareword &quot;tat&quot;, the combination of which is a
syntax error.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">6.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is a combination of the
previous two forms. It is valid only when not under
&quot;use&nbsp;utf8&quot; (normal identifier rules apply
when under &quot;use&nbsp;utf8&quot;). The form is a sigil,
followed by text in braces, where the first character is any
one of the characters in the range
&quot;[\x80&minus;\xFF]&quot; followed by
<small>ASCII</small> word characters up to the trailing
brace.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The same
caveats as the previous form apply: The non-graphic
characters are no longer allowed with
&quot;use&nbsp;utf8&quot;, it is unwise to use this form at
all, and utf8ness makes a big difference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to Perl
v5.24, non-graphical <small>ASCII</small> control characters
were also allowed in some situations; this had been
deprecated since v5.20.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Context</b>
<br>
The interpretation of operations and values in Perl
sometimes depends on the requirements of the context around
the operation or value. There are two major contexts: list
and scalar. Certain operations return list values in
contexts wanting a list, and scalar values otherwise. If
this is true of an operation it will be mentioned in the
documentation for that operation. In other words, Perl
overloads certain operations based on whether the expected
return value is singular or plural. Some words in English
work this way, like &quot;fish&quot; and
&quot;sheep&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a reciprocal
fashion, an operation provides either a scalar or a list
context to each of its arguments. For example, if you
say</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">int(
&lt;STDIN&gt; )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">the integer
operation provides scalar context for the &lt;&gt; operator,
which responds by reading one line from <small>STDIN</small>
and passing it back to the integer operation, which will
then find the integer value of that line and return that.
If, on the other hand, you say</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sort(
&lt;STDIN&gt; )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">then the sort
operation provides list context for &lt;&gt;, which will
proceed to read every line available up to the end of file,
and pass that list of lines back to the sort routine, which
will then sort those lines and return them as a list to
whatever the context of the sort was.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assignment is a
little bit special in that it uses its left argument to
determine the context for the right argument. Assignment to
a scalar evaluates the right-hand side in scalar context,
while assignment to an array or hash evaluates the righthand
side in list context. Assignment to a list (or slice, which
is just a list anyway) also evaluates the right-hand side in
list context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you use
the &quot;use warnings&quot; pragma or Perl&rsquo;s
<b>&minus;w</b> command-line option, you may see warnings
about useless uses of constants or functions in &quot;void
context&quot;. Void context just means the value has been
discarded, such as a statement containing only
&quot;&quot;fred&quot;;&quot; or &quot;getpwuid(0);&quot;.
It still counts as scalar context for functions that care
whether or not they&rsquo;re being called in list
context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">User-defined
subroutines may choose to care whether they are being called
in a void, scalar, or list context. Most subroutines do not
need to bother, though. That&rsquo;s because both scalars
and lists are automatically interpolated into lists. See
&quot;wantarray&quot; in perlfunc for how you would
dynamically discern your function&rsquo;s calling
context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Scalar
values</b> <br>
All data in Perl is a scalar, an array of scalars, or a hash
of scalars. A scalar may contain one single value in any of
three different flavors: a number, a string, or a reference.
In general, conversion from one form to another is
transparent. Although a scalar may not directly hold
multiple values, it may contain a reference to an array or
hash which in turn contains multiple values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Scalars
aren&rsquo;t necessarily one thing or another. There&rsquo;s
no place to declare a scalar variable to be of type
&quot;string&quot;, type &quot;number&quot;, type
&quot;reference&quot;, or anything else. Because of the
automatic conversion of scalars, operations that return
scalars don&rsquo;t need to care (and in fact, cannot care)
whether their caller is looking for a string, a number, or a
reference. Perl is a contextually polymorphic language whose
scalars can be strings, numbers, or references (which
includes objects). Although strings and numbers are
considered pretty much the same thing for nearly all
purposes, references are strongly-typed, uncastable pointers
with builtin reference-counting and destructor
invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A scalar value
is interpreted as <small>FALSE</small> in the Boolean sense
if it is undefined, the null string or the number 0 (or its
string equivalent, &quot;0&quot;), and <small>TRUE</small>
if it is anything else. The Boolean context is just a
special kind of scalar context where no conversion to a
string or a number is ever performed. Negation of a true
value by &quot;!&quot; or &quot;not&quot; returns a special
false value. When evaluated as a string it is treated as
&quot;&quot;, but as a number, it is treated as 0. Most Perl
operators that return true or false behave this way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
actually two varieties of null strings (sometimes referred
to as &quot;empty&quot; strings), a defined one and an
undefined one. The defined version is just a string of
length zero, such as &quot;&quot;. The undefined version is
the value that indicates that there is no real value for
something, such as when there was an error, or at end of
file, or when you refer to an uninitialized variable or
element of an array or hash. Although in early versions of
Perl, an undefined scalar could become defined when first
used in a place expecting a defined value, this no longer
happens except for rare cases of autovivification as
explained in perlref. You can use the <b>defined()</b>
operator to determine whether a scalar value is defined
(this has no meaning on arrays or hashes), and the
<b>undef()</b> operator to produce an undefined value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To find out
whether a given string is a valid non-zero number,
it&rsquo;s sometimes enough to test it against both numeric
0 and also lexical &quot;0&quot; (although this will cause
noises if warnings are on). That&rsquo;s because strings
that aren&rsquo;t numbers count as 0, just as they do in
<b>awk</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if ($str == 0
&amp;&amp; $str ne &quot;0&quot;) { <br>
warn &quot;That doesn't look like a number&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That method may
be best because otherwise you won&rsquo;t treat
<small>IEEE</small> notations like &quot;NaN&quot; or
&quot;Infinity&quot; properly. At other times, you might
prefer to determine whether string data can be used
numerically by calling the <b>POSIX::strtod()</b> function
or by inspecting your string with a regular expression (as
documented in perlre).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">warn &quot;has
nondigits&quot; if /\D/; <br>
warn &quot;not a natural number&quot; unless /^\d+$/; #
rejects &minus;3 <br>
warn &quot;not an integer&quot; unless /^&minus;?\d+$/; #
rejects +3 <br>
warn &quot;not an integer&quot; unless /^[+&minus;]?\d+$/;
<br>
warn &quot;not a decimal number&quot; unless
/^&minus;?\d+\.?\d*$/; # rejects .2 <br>
warn &quot;not a decimal number&quot; unless
/^&minus;?(?:\d+(?:\.\d*)?|\.\d+)$/; <br>
warn &quot;not a C float&quot; <br>
unless
/^([+&minus;]?)(?=\d|\.\d)\d*(\.\d*)?([Ee]([+&minus;]?\d+))?$/;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The length of
an array is a scalar value. You may find the length of array
@days by evaluating $#days, as in <b>csh</b>. However, this
isn&rsquo;t the length of the array; it&rsquo;s the
subscript of the last element, which is a different value
since there is ordinarily a 0th element. Assigning to $#days
actually changes the length of the array. Shortening an
array this way destroys intervening values. Lengthening an
array that was previously shortened does not recover values
that were in those elements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
gain some minuscule measure of efficiency by pre-extending
an array that is going to get big. You can also extend an
array by assigning to an element that is off the end of the
array. You can truncate an array down to nothing by
assigning the null list () to it. The following are
equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@whatever = ();
<br>
$#whatever = &minus;1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you evaluate
an array in scalar context, it returns the length of the
array. (Note that this is not true of lists, which return
the last value, like the C comma operator, nor of built-in
functions, which return whatever they feel like returning.)
The following is always true:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">scalar(@whatever)
== $#whatever + 1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
programmers choose to use an explicit conversion so as to
leave nothing to doubt:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$element_count
= scalar(@whatever);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you evaluate
a hash in scalar context, it returns a false value if the
hash is empty. If there are any key/value pairs, it returns
a true value. A more precise definition is version
dependent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to Perl
5.25 the value returned was a string consisting of the
number of used buckets and the number of allocated buckets,
separated by a slash. This is pretty much useful only to
find out whether Perl&rsquo;s internal hashing algorithm is
performing poorly on your data set. For example, you stick
10,000 things in a hash, but evaluating %HASH in scalar
context reveals &quot;1/16&quot;, which means only one out
of sixteen buckets has been touched, and presumably contains
all 10,000 of your items. This isn&rsquo;t supposed to
happen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl 5.25
the return was changed to be the count of keys in the hash.
If you need access to the old behavior you can use
&quot;Hash::Util::bucket_ratio()&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a tied hash
is evaluated in scalar context, the &quot;SCALAR&quot;
method is called (with a fallback to
&quot;FIRSTKEY&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can
preallocate space for a hash by assigning to the
<b>keys()</b> function. This rounds up the allocated buckets
to the next power of two:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">keys(%users) =
1000; # allocate 1024 buckets</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Scalar value
constructors</b> <br>
Numeric literals are specified in any of the following
floating point or integer formats:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">12345 <br>
12345.67 <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are allowed
to use underscores (underbars) in numeric literals between
digits for legibility (but not multiple underscores in a
row: &quot;23__500&quot; is not legal; &quot;23_500&quot;
is). You could, for example, group binary digits by threes
(as for a Unix-style mode argument such as 0b110_100_100) or
by fours (to represent nibbles, as in 0b1010_0110) or in
other groups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">String literals
are usually delimited by either single or double quotes.
They work much like quotes in the standard Unix shells:
double-quoted string literals are subject to backslash and
variable substitution; single-quoted strings are not (except
for &quot;\'&quot; and &quot;\\&quot;). The usual
C&minus;style backslash rules apply for making characters
such as newline, tab, etc., as well as some more exotic
forms. See &quot;Quote and Quote-like Operators&quot; in
perlop for a list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hexadecimal,
octal, or binary, representations in string literals (e.g.
&rsquo;0xff&rsquo;) are not automatically converted to their
integer representation. The <b>hex()</b> and <b>oct()</b>
functions make these conversions for you. See
&quot;hex&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;oct&quot; in perlfunc
for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hexadecimal
floating point can start just like a hexadecimal literal,
and it can be followed by an optional fractional hexadecimal
part, but it must be followed by &quot;p&quot;, an optional
sign, and a power of two. The format is useful for
accurately presenting floating point values, avoiding
conversions to or from decimal floating point, and therefore
avoiding possible loss in precision. Notice that while most
current platforms use the 64&minus;bit <small>IEEE
754</small> floating point, not all do. Another potential
source of (low-order) differences are the floating point
rounding modes, which can differ between CPUs, operating
systems, and compilers, and which Perl doesn&rsquo;t
control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
embed newlines directly in your strings, i.e., they can end
on a different line than they begin. This is nice, but if
you forget your trailing quote, the error will not be
reported until Perl finds another line containing the quote
character, which may be much further on in the script.
Variable substitution inside strings is limited to scalar
variables, arrays, and array or hash slices. (In other
words, names beginning with $ or @, followed by an optional
bracketed expression as a subscript.) The following code
segment prints out &quot;The price is $100.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$Price =
'$100'; # not interpolated <br>
print &quot;The price is $Price.\n&quot;; # interpolated</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
double interpolation in Perl, so the $100 is left as is.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default
floating point numbers substituted inside strings use the
dot (&quot;.&quot;) as the decimal separator. If &quot;use
locale&quot; is in effect, and <b>POSIX::setlocale()</b> has
been called, the character used for the decimal separator is
affected by the <small>LC_NUMERIC</small> locale. See
perllocale and <small>POSIX</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Demarcated
variable names using braces</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As in some
shells, you can enclose the variable name in braces as a
demarcator to disambiguate it from following alphanumerics
and underscores or other text. You must also do this when
interpolating a variable into a string to separate the
variable name from a following double-colon or an apostrophe
since these would be otherwise treated as a package
separator:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$who =
&quot;Larry&quot;; <br>
print PASSWD
&quot;${who}::0:0:Superuser:/:/bin/perl\n&quot;; <br>
print &quot;We use ${who}speak when ${who}'s
here.\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Without the
braces, Perl would have looked for a $whospeak, a $who::0,
and a &quot;$who's&quot; variable. The last two would be the
$0 and the $s variables in the (presumably) non-existent
package &quot;who&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In fact, a
simple identifier within such curly braces is forced to be a
string, and likewise within a hash subscript. Neither need
quoting. Our earlier example, $days{'Feb'} can be written as
$days{Feb} and the quotes will be assumed automatically. But
anything more complicated in the subscript will be
interpreted as an expression. This means for example that
&quot;$version{2.0}++&quot; is equivalent to
&quot;$version{2}++&quot;, not to
&quot;$version{'2.0'}++&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
similar problem with interpolation with text that looks like
array or hash access notation. Placing a simple variable
like $who immediately in front of text like &quot;[1]&quot;
or &quot;{foo}&quot; would cause the variable to be
interpolated as accessing an element of @who or a value
stored in %who:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$who =
&quot;Larry Wall&quot;; <br>
print &quot;$who[1] is the father of Perl.\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would attempt
to access index 1 of an array named @who. Again, using
braces will prevent this from happening:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$who =
&quot;Larry Wall&quot;; <br>
print &quot;${who}[1] is the father of Perl.\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will be treated
the same as</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$who =
&quot;Larry Wall&quot;; <br>
print $who . &quot;[1] is the father of Perl.\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This notation
also applies to more complex variable descriptions, such as
array or hash access with subscripts. For instance</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@name =
qw(Larry Curly Moe); <br>
print &quot;Also ${name[0]}[1] was a member\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Without the
braces the above example would be parsed as a two level
array subscript in the @name array, and under &quot;use
strict&quot; would likely produce a fatal exception, as it
would be parsed like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print
&quot;Also &quot; . $name[0][1] . &quot; was a
member\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and not as the
intended:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print
&quot;Also &quot; . $name[0] . &quot;[1] was a
member\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A similar
result may be derived by using a backslash on the first
character of the subscript or package notation that is not
part of the variable you want to access. Thus the above
example could also be written:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@name =
qw(Larry Curly Moe); <br>
print &quot;Also $name[0]\[1] was a member\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">however for
some special variables (multi character caret variables) the
demarcated form using curly braces is the <b>only</b> way
you can reference the variable at all, and the only way you
can access a subscript of the variable via
interpolation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Consider the
magic array &quot;@{^CAPTURE}&quot; which is populated by
the regex engine with the contents of all of the capture
buffers in a pattern (see perlvar and perlre). The
<b>only</b> way you can access one of these members inside
of a string is via the braced (demarcated) form:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;abc&quot;=~/(.)(.)(.)/
<br>
and print &quot;Second buffer is ${^CAPTURE[1]}&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is equivalent
to</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;abc&quot;=~/(.)(.)(.)/
<br>
and print &quot;Second buffer is &quot; .
${^CAPTURE}[1];</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Saying
&quot;@^CAPTURE&quot; is a syntax error, so it <b>must</b>
be referenced as &quot;@{^CAPTURE}&quot;, and to access one
of its elements in normal code you would write &quot;
${^CAPTURE}[1] &quot;. However when interpolating in a
string &quot;${^CAPTURE}[1]&quot; would be equivalent to
&quot;${^CAPTURE} . &quot;[1]&quot;&quot;, which does not
even refer to the same variable! Thus the subscripts must
<b>also</b> be placed <b>inside</b> of the braces:
&quot;${^CAPTURE[1]}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The demarcated
form using curly braces can be used with all the different
types of variable access, including array and hash slices.
For instance code like the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@name =
qw(Larry Curly Moe); <br>
local $&quot; = &quot; and &quot;; <br>
print &quot;My favorites were @{name[1,2]}.\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would
output</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">My favorites
were Curly and Moe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Special
floating point: infinity (Inf) and not-a-number
(NaN)</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Floating point
values include the special values &quot;Inf&quot; and
&quot;NaN&quot;, for infinity and not-a-number. The infinity
can be also negative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The infinity is
the result of certain math operations that overflow the
floating point range, like 9**9**9. The not-a-number is the
result when the result is undefined or unrepresentable.
Though note that you cannot get &quot;NaN&quot; from some
common &quot;undefined&quot; or &quot;out-of-range&quot;
operations like dividing by zero, or square root of a
negative number, since Perl generates fatal errors for
those.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The infinity
and not-a-number have their own special arithmetic rules.
The general rule is that they are &quot;contagious&quot;:
&quot;Inf&quot; plus one is &quot;Inf&quot;, and
&quot;NaN&quot; plus one is &quot;NaN&quot;. Where things
get interesting is when you combine infinities and
not-a-numbers: &quot;Inf&quot; minus &quot;Inf&quot; and
&quot;Inf&quot; divided by &quot;Inf&quot; are
&quot;NaN&quot; (while &quot;Inf&quot; plus &quot;Inf&quot;
is &quot;Inf&quot; and &quot;Inf&quot; times &quot;Inf&quot;
is &quot;Inf&quot;). &quot;NaN&quot; is also curious in that
it does not equal any number, <i>including</i> itself:
&quot;NaN&quot; != &quot;NaN&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl
doesn&rsquo;t understand &quot;Inf&quot; and &quot;NaN&quot;
as numeric literals, but you can have them as strings, and
Perl will convert them as needed: &quot;Inf&quot; + 1. (You
can, however, import them from the <small>POSIX</small>
extension; &quot;use POSIX qw(Inf NaN);&quot; and then use
them as literals.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that on
input (string to number) Perl accepts &quot;Inf&quot; and
&quot;NaN&quot; in many forms. Case is ignored, and the
Win32&minus;specific forms like &quot;1.#INF&quot; are
understood, but on output the values are normalized to
&quot;Inf&quot; and &quot;NaN&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Version
Strings</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A literal of
the form &quot;v1.20.300.4000&quot; is parsed as a string
composed of characters with the specified ordinals. This
form, known as v&minus;strings, provides an alternative,
more readable way to construct strings, rather than use the
somewhat less readable interpolation form
&quot;\x{1}\x{14}\x{12c}\x{fa0}&quot;. This is useful for
representing Unicode strings, and for comparing version
&quot;numbers&quot; using the string comparison operators,
&quot;cmp&quot;, &quot;gt&quot;, &quot;lt&quot; etc. If
there are two or more dots in the literal, the leading
&quot;v&quot; may be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print v9786; #
prints SMILEY, &quot;\x{263a}&quot; <br>
print v102.111.111; # prints &quot;foo&quot; <br>
print 102.111.111; # same</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Such literals
are accepted by both &quot;require&quot; and &quot;use&quot;
for doing a version check. Note that using the
v&minus;strings for IPv4 addresses is not portable unless
you also use the <b>inet_aton()</b>/<b>inet_ntoa()</b>
routines of the Socket package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that since
Perl 5.8.1 the single-number v&minus;strings (like
&quot;v65&quot;) are not v&minus;strings before the
&quot;=&gt;&quot; operator (which is usually used to
separate a hash key from a hash value); instead they are
interpreted as literal strings (&rsquo;v65&rsquo;). They
were v&minus;strings from Perl 5.6.0 to Perl 5.8.0, but that
caused more confusion and breakage than good. Multi-number
v&minus;strings like &quot;v65.66&quot; and 65.66.67
continue to be v&minus;strings always.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Special
Literals</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The special
literals __FILE__, __LINE__, and __PACKAGE__ represent the
current filename, line number, and package name at that
point in your program. __SUB__ gives a reference to the
current subroutine. They may be used only as separate
tokens; they will not be interpolated into strings. If there
is no current package (due to an empty &quot;package;&quot;
directive), __PACKAGE__ is the undefined value. (But the
empty &quot;package;&quot; is no longer supported, as of
version 5.10.) Outside of a subroutine, __SUB__ is the
undefined value. __SUB__ is only available in 5.16 or
higher, and only with a &quot;use v5.16&quot; or &quot;use
feature &quot;current_sub&quot;&quot; declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two control
characters ^D and ^Z, and the tokens __END__ and __DATA__
may be used to indicate the logical end of the script before
the actual end of file. Any following text is ignored by the
interpreter unless read by the program as described
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Text after
__DATA__ may be read via the filehandle
&quot;PACKNAME::DATA&quot;, where &quot;PACKNAME&quot; is
the package that was current when the __DATA__ token was
encountered. The filehandle is left open pointing to the
line after __DATA__. The program should &quot;close
DATA&quot; when it is done reading from it. (Leaving it open
leaks filehandles if the module is reloaded for any reason,
so it&rsquo;s a safer practice to close it.) For
compatibility with older scripts written before __DATA__ was
introduced, __END__ behaves like __DATA__ in the top level
script (but not in files loaded with &quot;require&quot; or
&quot;do&quot;) and leaves the remaining contents of the
file accessible via &quot;main::DATA&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">while (my $line
= &lt;DATA&gt;) { print $line; } <br>
close DATA; <br>
__DATA__ <br>
Hello world.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;DATA&quot; file handle by default has whatever PerlIO
layers were in place when Perl read the file to parse the
source. Normally that means that the file is being read
bytewise, as if it were encoded in Latin&minus;1, but there
are two major ways for it to be otherwise. Firstly, if the
&quot;__END__&quot;/&quot;__DATA__&quot; token is in the
scope of a &quot;use utf8&quot; pragma then the
&quot;DATA&quot; handle will be in
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> mode. And secondly, if the source
is being read from perl&rsquo;s standard input then the
&quot;DATA&quot; file handle is actually aliased to the
&quot;STDIN&quot; file handle, and may be in
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> mode because of the
&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot; environment variable or
perl&rsquo;s command-line switches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See SelfLoader
for more description of __DATA__, and an example of its use.
Note that you cannot read from the <small>DATA</small>
filehandle in a <small>BEGIN</small> block: the
<small>BEGIN</small> block is executed as soon as it is seen
(during compilation), at which point the corresponding
__DATA__ (or __END__) token has not yet been seen.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Barewords</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A word that has
no other interpretation in the grammar will be treated as if
it were a quoted string. These are known as
&quot;barewords&quot;. As with filehandles and labels, a
bareword that consists entirely of lowercase letters risks
conflict with future reserved words, and if you use the
&quot;use warnings&quot; pragma or the <b>&minus;w</b>
switch, Perl will warn you about any such words. Perl limits
barewords (like identifiers) to about 250 characters. Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary
limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some people may
wish to outlaw barewords entirely. If you say</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use strict
'subs';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">then any
bareword that would <small>NOT</small> be interpreted as a
subroutine call produces a compile-time error instead. The
restriction lasts to the end of the enclosing block. An
inner block may countermand this by saying &quot;no strict
'subs'&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Array
Interpolation</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arrays and
slices are interpolated into double-quoted strings by
joining the elements with the delimiter specified in the
$&quot; variable ($LIST_SEPARATOR if &quot;use
English;&quot; is specified), space by default. The
following are equivalent:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$temp =
join($&quot;, @ARGV); <br>
system &quot;echo $temp&quot;; <br>
system &quot;echo @ARGV&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within search
patterns (which also undergo double-quotish substitution)
there is an unfortunate ambiguity: Is
&quot;/$foo[bar]/&quot; to be interpreted as
&quot;/${foo}[bar]/&quot; (where &quot;[bar]&quot; is a
character class for the regular expression) or as
&quot;/${foo[bar]}/&quot; (where &quot;[bar]&quot; is the
subscript to array @foo)? If @foo doesn&rsquo;t otherwise
exist, then it&rsquo;s obviously a character class. If @foo
exists, Perl takes a good guess about &quot;[bar]&quot;, and
is almost always right. If it does guess wrong, or if
you&rsquo;re just plain paranoid, you can force the correct
interpretation with curly braces as above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
looking for the information on how to use here-documents,
which used to be here, that&rsquo;s been moved to
&quot;Quote and Quote-like Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>List value
constructors</b> <br>
List values are denoted by separating individual values by
commas (and enclosing the list in parentheses where
precedence requires it):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(LIST)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a context
not requiring a list value, the value of what appears to be
a list literal is simply the value of the final element, as
with the C comma operator. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@foo = ('cc',
'&minus;E', $bar);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">assigns the
entire list value to array @foo, but</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$foo = ('cc',
'&minus;E', $bar);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">assigns the
value of variable $bar to the scalar variable $foo. Note
that the value of an actual array in scalar context is the
length of the array; the following assigns the value 3 to
$foo:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@foo = ('cc',
'&minus;E', $bar); <br>
$foo = @foo; # $foo gets 3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may have an
optional comma before the closing parenthesis of a list
literal, so that you can say:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@foo = ( <br>
1, <br>
2, <br>
3, <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use a
here-document to assign an array, one line per element, you
might use an approach like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@sauces =
&lt;&lt;End_Lines =~ m/(\S.*\S)/g; <br>
normal tomato <br>
spicy tomato <br>
green chile <br>
pesto <br>
white wine <br>
End_Lines</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LISTs do
automatic interpolation of sublists. That is, when a
<small>LIST</small> is evaluated, each element of the list
is evaluated in list context, and the resulting list value
is interpolated into <small>LIST</small> just as if each
individual element were a member of <small>LIST.</small>
Thus arrays and hashes lose their identity in a LIST--the
list</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(@foo,@bar,&amp;SomeSub,%glarch)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">contains all
the elements of @foo followed by all the elements of @bar,
followed by all the elements returned by the subroutine
named SomeSub called in list context, followed by the
key/value pairs of %glarch. To make a list reference that
does <i><small>NOT</small></i> interpolate, see perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The null list
is represented by (). Interpolating it in a list has no
effect. Thus ((),(),()) is equivalent to (). Similarly,
interpolating an array with no elements is the same as if no
array had been interpolated at that point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
interpolation combines with the facts that the opening and
closing parentheses are optional (except when necessary for
precedence) and lists may end with an optional comma to mean
that multiple commas within lists are legal syntax. The list
&quot;1,,3&quot; is a concatenation of two lists,
&quot;1,&quot; and 3, the first of which ends with that
optional comma. &quot;1,,3&quot; is &quot;(1,),(3)&quot; is
&quot;1,3&quot; (And similarly for &quot;1,,,3&quot; is
&quot;(1,),(,),3&quot; is &quot;1,3&quot; and so on.) Not
that we&rsquo;d advise you to use this obfuscation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A list value
may also be subscripted like a normal array. You must put
the list in parentheses to avoid ambiguity. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># Stat returns
list value. <br>
$time = (stat($file))[8]; <br>
# SYNTAX ERROR HERE. <br>
$time = stat($file)[8]; # OOPS, FORGOT PARENTHESES <br>
# Find a hex digit. <br>
$hexdigit = ('a','b','c','d','e','f')[$digit&minus;10]; <br>
# A &quot;reverse comma operator&quot;. <br>
return (pop(@foo),pop(@foo))[0];</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lists may be
assigned to only when each element of the list is itself
legal to assign to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">($x, $y, $z) =
(1, 2, 3); <br>
($map{'red'}, $map{'blue'}, $map{'green'}) = (0x00f, 0x0f0,
0xf00);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An exception to
this is that you may assign to &quot;undef&quot; in a list.
This is useful for throwing away some of the return values
of a function:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">($dev, $ino,
undef, undef, $uid, $gid) = stat($file);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.22, you can also use &quot;(undef)x2&quot; instead of
&quot;undef, undef&quot;. (You can also do &quot;($x) x
2&quot;, which is less useful, because it assigns to the
same variable twice, clobbering the first value
assigned.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you assign
a list of scalars to an array, all previous values in that
array are wiped out and the number of elements in the array
will now be equal to the number of elements in the
right-hand list -- the list from which assignment was made.
The array will automatically resize itself to precisely
accommodate each element in the right-hand list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When, however,
you assign a list of scalars to another list of scalars, the
results differ according to whether the left-hand list --
the list being assigned to -- has the same, more or fewer
elements than the right-hand list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">($x, $y, $z) =

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the number
of scalars in the left-hand list is less than that in the
right-hand list, the &quot;extra&quot; scalars in the
right-hand list will simply not be assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the number
of scalars in the left-hand list is greater than that in the

undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">List assignment
in scalar context returns the number of elements produced by
the expression on the right side of the assignment:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$x =
(($foo,$bar) = (3,2,1)); # set $x to 3, not 2 <br>
$x = (($foo,$bar) = f()); # set $x to f()'s return count</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is handy
when you want to do a list assignment in a Boolean context,
because most list functions return a null list when
finished, which when assigned produces a 0, which is
interpreted as <small>FALSE.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s also
the source of a useful idiom for executing a function or
performing an operation in list context and then counting
the number of return values, by assigning to an empty list
and then using that assignment in scalar context. For
example, this code:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$count = () =
$string =~ /\d+/g;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will place into
$count the number of digit groups found in $string. This
happens because the pattern match is in list context (since
it is being assigned to the empty list), and will therefore
return a list of all matching parts of the string. The list
assignment in scalar context will translate that into the
number of elements (here, the number of times the pattern
matched) and assign that to $count. Note that simply
using</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$count =
$string =~ /\d+/g;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would not have
worked, since a pattern match in scalar context will only
return true or false, rather than a count of matches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The final
element of a list assignment may be an array or a hash:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">($x, $y, @rest)
= split; <br>
my($x, $y, %rest) = @_;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can
actually put an array or hash anywhere in the list, but the
first one in the list will soak up all the values, and
anything after it will become undefined. This may be useful
in a <b>my()</b> or <b>local()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A hash can be
initialized using a literal list holding pairs of items to
be interpreted as a key and a value:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># same as map
assignment above <br>
%map = ('red',0x00f,'blue',0x0f0,'green',0xf00);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While literal
lists and named arrays are often interchangeable,
that&rsquo;s not the case for hashes. Just because you can
subscript a list value like a normal array does not mean
that you can subscript a list value as a hash. Likewise,
hashes included as parts of other lists (including
parameters lists and return lists from functions) always
flatten out into key/value pairs. That&rsquo;s why
it&rsquo;s good to use references sometimes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is often
more readable to use the &quot;=&gt;&quot; operator between
key/value pairs. The &quot;=&gt;&quot; operator is mostly
just a more visually distinctive synonym for a comma, but it
also arranges for its left-hand operand to be interpreted as
a string if it&rsquo;s a bareword that would be a legal
simple identifier. &quot;=&gt;&quot; doesn&rsquo;t quote
compound identifiers, that contain double colons. This makes
it nice for initializing hashes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%map = ( <br>
red =&gt; 0x00f, <br>
blue =&gt; 0x0f0, <br>
green =&gt; 0xf00, <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or for
initializing hash references to be used as records:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$rec = { <br>
witch =&gt; 'Mable the Merciless', <br>
cat =&gt; 'Fluffy the Ferocious', <br>
date =&gt; '10/31/1776', <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or for using
call-by-named-parameter to complicated functions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$field =

values =&gt; ['eenie','meenie','minie'], <br>
default =&gt; 'meenie', <br>
linebreak =&gt; 'true', <br>
labels =&gt; \%labels <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that just
because a hash is initialized in that order doesn&rsquo;t
mean that it comes out in that order. See &quot;sort&quot;
in perlfunc for examples of how to arrange for an output
ordering.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a key
appears more than once in the initializer list of a hash,
the last occurrence wins:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%circle = (
<br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
used to provide overridable configuration defaults:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># values in
%args take priority over %config_defaults <br>
%config = (%config_defaults, %args);</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Subscripts</b>
<br>
An array can be accessed one scalar at a time by specifying
a dollar sign (&quot;$&quot;), then the name of the array
(without the leading &quot;@&quot;), then the subscript
inside square brackets. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@myarray = (5,
50, 500, 5000); <br>
print &quot;The Third Element is&quot;, $myarray[2],
&quot;\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The array
indices start with 0. A negative subscript retrieves its
value from the end. In our example, $myarray[&minus;1] would
have been 5000, and $myarray[&minus;2] would have been
500.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hash subscripts
are similar, only instead of square brackets curly brackets
are used. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%scientists =
<br>
( <br>
&quot;Newton&quot; =&gt; &quot;Isaac&quot;, <br>
&quot;Einstein&quot; =&gt; &quot;Albert&quot;, <br>
&quot;Darwin&quot; =&gt; &quot;Charles&quot;, <br>
&quot;Feynman&quot; =&gt; &quot;Richard&quot;, <br>
); <br>
print &quot;Darwin's First Name is &quot;,
$scientists{&quot;Darwin&quot;}, &quot;\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
subscript a list to get a single element from it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$dir =
(getpwnam(&quot;daemon&quot;))[7];</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Multi-dimensional
array emulation</b> <br>
Multidimensional arrays may be emulated by subscripting a
hash with a list. The elements of the list are joined with
the subscript separator (see &quot;$;&quot; in perlvar).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$foo{$x,$y,$z}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is equivalent
to</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$foo{join($;,
$x, $y, $z)}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
subscript separator is &quot;\034&quot;, the same as
<small>SUBSEP</small> in <b>awk</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Slices</b>
<br>
A slice accesses several elements of a list, an array, or a
hash simultaneously using a list of subscripts. It&rsquo;s
more convenient than writing out the individual elements as
a list of separate scalar values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">($him, $her) =
@folks[0,&minus;1]; # array slice <br>
@them = @folks[0 .. 3]; # array slice <br>
($who, $home) = @ENV{&quot;USER&quot;, &quot;HOME&quot;}; #
hash slice <br>
($uid, $dir) = (getpwnam(&quot;daemon&quot;))[2,7]; # list
slice</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since you can
assign to a list of variables, you can also assign to an
array or hash slice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@days[3..5] =
qw/Wed Thu Fri/; <br>
@colors{'red','blue','green'} <br>
= (0xff0000, 0x0000ff, 0x00ff00); <br>
@folks[0, &minus;1] = @folks[&minus;1, 0];</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The previous
assignments are exactly equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">($days[3],
$days[4], $days[5]) = qw/Wed Thu Fri/; <br>
($colors{'red'}, $colors{'blue'}, $colors{'green'}) <br>
= (0xff0000, 0x0000ff, 0x00ff00); <br>
($folks[0], $folks[&minus;1]) = ($folks[&minus;1],
$folks[0]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since changing
a slice changes the original array or hash that it&rsquo;s
slicing, a &quot;foreach&quot; construct will alter some--or
even all--of the values of the array or hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">foreach
(@array[ 4 .. 10 ]) { s/peter/paul/ } <br>
foreach (@hash{qw[key1 key2]}) { <br>
s/^\s+//; # trim leading whitespace <br>
s/\s+$//; # trim trailing whitespace <br>
s/\b(\w)(\w*)\b/\u$1\L$2/g; # &quot;titlecase&quot; words
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
exception, when you slice a list (but not an array or a
hash), if the list evaluates to empty, then taking a slice
of that empty list will always yield the empty list in turn.
Thus:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@a = ()[0,1]; #
@a has no elements <br>
@b = (@a)[0,1]; # @b has no elements <br>
@c = (sub{}&minus;&gt;())[0,1]; # @c has no elements <br>
@d = ('a','b')[0,1]; # @d has two elements <br>
@e = (@d)[0,1,8,9]; # @e has four elements <br>
@f = (@d)[8,9]; # @f has two elements</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This makes it
easy to write loops that terminate when a null list is
returned:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">while ( ($home,
$user) = (getpwent)[7,0] ) { <br>
printf &quot;%&minus;8s %s\n&quot;, $user, $home; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As noted
earlier in this document, the scalar sense of list
assignment is the number of elements on the right-hand side
of the assignment. The null list contains no elements, so
when the password file is exhausted, the result is 0, not
2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Slices in
scalar context return the last item of the slice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@a = qw/first
second third/; <br>
%h = (first =&gt; 'A', second =&gt; 'B'); <br>
$t = @a[0, 1]; # $t is now 'second' <br>
$u = @h{'first', 'second'}; # $u is now 'B'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
confused about why you use an &rsquo;@&rsquo; there on a
hash slice instead of a &rsquo;%&rsquo;, think of it like
this. The type of bracket (square or curly) governs whether
it&rsquo;s an array or a hash being looked at. On the other
hand, the leading symbol (&rsquo;$&rsquo; or
&rsquo;@&rsquo;) on the array or hash indicates whether you
are getting back a singular value (a scalar) or a plural one
(a list).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Key/Value
Hash Slices</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Starting in
Perl 5.20, a hash slice operation with the % symbol is a
variant of slice operation returning a list of key/value
pairs rather than just values:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%h = (blonk
=&gt; 2, foo =&gt; 3, squink =&gt; 5, bar =&gt; 8); <br>
%subset = %h{'foo', 'bar'}; # key/value hash slice <br>
# %subset is now (foo =&gt; 3, bar =&gt; 8) <br>
%removed = delete %h{'foo', 'bar'}; <br>
# %removed is now (foo =&gt; 3, bar =&gt; 8) <br>
# %h is now (blonk =&gt; 2, squink =&gt; 5)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
result of such a slice cannot be localized or assigned to.
These are otherwise very much consistent with hash slices
using the @ symbol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Index/Value
Array Slices</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similar to
key/value hash slices (and also introduced in Perl 5.20),
the % array slice syntax returns a list of index/value
pairs:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@a =
&quot;a&quot;..&quot;z&quot;; <br>
@list = %a[3,4,6]; <br>
# @list is now (3, &quot;d&quot;, 4, &quot;e&quot;, 6,
&quot;g&quot;) <br>
@removed = delete %a[3,4,6] <br>
# @removed is now (3, &quot;d&quot;, 4, &quot;e&quot;, 6,
&quot;g&quot;) <br>
# @list[3,4,6] are now undef</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
calling &quot;delete&quot; on array values is strongly
discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Typeglobs
and Filehandles</b> <br>
Perl uses an internal type called a <i>typeglob</i> to hold
an entire symbol table entry. The type prefix of a typeglob
is a &quot;*&quot;, because it represents all types. This
used to be the preferred way to pass arrays and hashes by
reference into a function, but now that we have real
references, this is seldom needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main use of
typeglobs in modern Perl is create symbol table aliases.
This assignment:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*this =
*that;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">makes $this an
alias for $that, @this an alias for @that, %this an alias
for %that, &amp;this an alias for &amp;that, etc. Much safer
is to use a reference. This:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">local
*Here::blue = \$There::green;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">temporarily
makes $Here::blue an alias for $There::green, but
doesn&rsquo;t make @Here::blue an alias for @There::green,
or %Here::blue an alias for %There::green, etc. See
&quot;Symbol Tables&quot; in perlmod for more examples of
this. Strange though this may seem, this is the basis for
the whole module import/export system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another use for
typeglobs is to pass filehandles into a function or to
create new filehandles. If you need to use a typeglob to
save away a filehandle, do it this way:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$fh =
*STDOUT;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or perhaps as a
real reference, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$fh =
\*STDOUT;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See perlsub for
examples of using these as indirect filehandles in
functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typeglobs are
also a way to create a local filehandle using the
<b>local()</b> operator. These last until their block is
exited, but may be passed back. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub newopen {
<br>
my $path = shift; <br>
local *FH; # not my! <br>
open (FH, $path) or return undef; <br>
return *FH; <br>
} <br>
$fh = newopen('/etc/passwd');</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now that we
have the *foo{THING} notation, typeglobs aren&rsquo;t used
as much for filehandle manipulations, although they&rsquo;re
still needed to pass brand new file and directory handles
into or out of functions. That&rsquo;s because *HANDLE{IO}
only works if <small>HANDLE</small> has already been used as
a handle. In other words, *FH must be used to create new
symbol table entries; *foo{THING} cannot. When in doubt, use
*FH.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All functions
that are capable of creating filehandles (<b>open()</b>,
<b>opendir()</b>, <b>pipe()</b>, <b>socketpair()</b>,
<b>sysopen()</b>, <b>socket()</b>, and <b>accept()</b>)
automatically create an anonymous filehandle if the handle
passed to them is an uninitialized scalar variable. This
allows the constructs such as &quot;open(my $fh, ...)&quot;
and &quot;open(local $fh,...)&quot; to be used to create
filehandles that will conveniently be closed automatically
when the scope ends, provided there are no other references
to them. This largely eliminates the need for typeglobs when
opening filehandles that must be passed around, as in the
following example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub myopen {
<br>
open my $fh, &quot;@_&quot; <br>
or die &quot;Can't open '@_': $!&quot;; <br>
return $fh; <br>
} <br>
{ <br>
my $f = myopen(&quot;&lt;/etc/motd&quot;); <br>
print &lt;$f&gt;; <br>
# $f implicitly closed here <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if an
initialized scalar variable is used instead the result is
different: &quot;my $fh='zzz'; open($fh, ...)&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;open( *{'zzz'}, ...)&quot;. &quot;use
strict 'refs'&quot; forbids such practice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another way to
create anonymous filehandles is with the Symbol module or
with the IO::Handle module and its ilk. These modules have
the advantage of not hiding different types of the same name
during the <b>local()</b>. See the bottom of
&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc for an example.</p>
