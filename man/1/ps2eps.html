<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page documents <b>ps2eps</b> version 1.70.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ps2eps</b>
is a tool (written in Perl) to produce Encapsulated
PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF) from usual one-paged Postscript
documents. It calculates correct Bounding Boxes for those
EPS files and filters some special postscript command
sequences that can produce erroneous results on printers.
EPS files are often needed for including (scalable) graphics
of high quality into TeX/LaTeX (or even Word) documents. It
can also be used to calculate correct BoundingBoxes for PDF
files by using the option <b>--BBonly</b>. However, it
cannot produce a PDF file, but it can be used together with
<b>pdfcrop</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Without any
argument, ps2eps reads from standard input and writes to
standard output. If filenames are given as arguments they
are processed one by one and output files are written to
filenames with extension <i>.eps</i>. If input filenames
have the extension <i>.ps</i> or <i>.prn</i>, this extension
is replaced with <i>.eps</i>. In all other cases <i>.eps</i>
is appended to the input filename. Please note that
PostScript files for input should contain only one single
page (you can possibly use the <b>psselect</b> from the
psutils package to extract a single page from a document
that contains multiple pages).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If BoundingBox
in output seems to be wrong, please try options
<b>--size</b> or <b>--ignoreBB</b>. See also section
TROUBLESHOOTING.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ps2eps</b>
follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (&lsquo;-&rsquo;). A summary of
options is included below. <b><br>
-h, --help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Show summary of options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V, --version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Show version of program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-f, --force</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force overwriting existing
files. <b>ps2eps</b> will not overwrite files by default to
avoid deleting original EPS files accidently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-q, --quiet</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">quiet operation (no output
while processing files, except errors).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-N, --noinsert</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">do not insert any postscript
code. Normally a few postscript instructions are added
around the original postscript code by <b>ps2eps</b> which
can be turned off by this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-O,
--preserveorientation</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">do not filter %%Orientation:
header comment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-X, --BBonly</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Just print the resulting
bounding box(es) to standard error, no output file is
written. <b>ps2eps</b> will perform a read-only operation.
This is highly useful to calculate bounding boxes of PDF
files. Can be used with option <b>--quiet</b> to suppress
other output and also with <b>--nohires</b> to suppress
output of the HiResBoundingBox. It can be used with
<b>pdfcrop</b> as follows: <b>pdfcrop --gscmd
&rsquo;gswrap-ps2eps.sh&rsquo; file.pdf</b> where
<b>gswrap-ps2eps.sh</b> containts something like <b>ps2eps
-l -X -q $BASH_ARGV</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-n, --nofix</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">do not try to fix postscript
code by filtering some instructions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-P, --removepreview</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">remove preview image (smaller
file, but no preview anymore).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-F, --fixps</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">fix postscript code
unconditionally. Otherwise, filtering is usually triggered
by detection of certain drivers only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-c, --comments</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">preserve document structure
comments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-C, --clip</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">insert postscript code for
clipping. Unless <b>--nohires</b> is specified, the
HiResBoundingBox (enlarged by 0.1 points) is used for
clipping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-m, --mono</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">use black/white bitmap as base
for calculation (default: off).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s, --size=pagedim</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where pagedim is a pre-defined
standard page size (e.g., a4,a0,b0,letter,...) or explicitly
specified in a format pagedim:=<i>X</i>x<i>Y</i>[cm|in],
where <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are numbers (floating points are
accepted) followed by units centimeter (cm) or inch (in),
(default: cm). Use <b>--size=list</b> to list pre-defined
pagesizes. See also environment variable PS2EPS_SIZE.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t, --translate=x,y</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">specify an x,y offset (may be
negative) in postscript points (1/72 dpi) for drawing. This
option may be required if your drawing has negative
coordinates which usually lets ghostscript cut the negative
part of your picture, because it starts to render at
positive coordinates. The resulting output will also be
shifted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-r, --resolution=dpi</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">specify a resolution in dpi
(dots per inch) for drawing under ghostscript. Default
resolution is 144 dpi which is the double of the typical 72
dpi. This option may help if there is a hardware dependent
resolution encoded in the postscript, e.g., 600dpi. Example:
<b>ps2eps -l -r 600 test.ps</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-R,
--rotate=direction</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option rotates the
resulting EPS output. The parameter direction determines the
direction of rotation: + means +90 degrees (clockwise),-
means -90 degrees (counter-clockwise), and ^ means 180
degrees (up-side down).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-l, --loose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">expand the original tight
bounding box by one point in each direction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-B, --ignoreBB</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">do not use existing bounding
box as page size for rendering.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-E, --ignoreEOF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">do not use %%EOF as hint for
end of file. Otherwise, <b>ps2eps</b> assumes that
postscript code ends after the last %%EOF comment, because
some drivers add trailing binary
&lsquo;&lsquo;garbage&rsquo;&rsquo; code which gets deleted
by <b>ps2eps</b> by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-g, --gsbbox</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">use internal bbox device of
ghostscript instead of the external C program <b>bbox</b>.
The internal bbox device of ghostscript generates different
values (sometimes even incorrect), so using the provided
<b>bbox</b> should be more robust. See also environment
variable PS2EPS_GSBBOX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-H, --nohires</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">do not generate a
%%HiResBoundingBox comment for output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-a, --accuracy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">increase the accuracy by
turning subsample antialiasing on (may be slower)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-L, --license</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">show licensing information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-d, --debuggs</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">show ghostscript call. This may
be helpful for solving problems that occur during a
ghostscript call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-W, --warnings</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">show warnings about sanity of
generated EPS file. Certain postscript commands should not
be contained in an EPS file. With this option set
<b>ps2eps</b> will issue a warning if it detects at least
one of them.</p>

<h2>TROUBLESHOOTING
<a name="TROUBLESHOOTING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Based on the
given postscript source code (in most cases generated by
some postscript printer driver) there are many potential
obstacles or problems that may occur when trying to create
proper EPS files. Please read this section carefully to be
aware of common pitfalls.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>INCOMPLETE/CLIPPED
IMAGES</b> <br>
or how to determine the right size for ghostscript.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
documents that are larger than your ghostscript default
(usually A4 or US letter), you have to specify the page
dimensions explicitly using the <b>-s</b> option. Otherwise
your EPS might be cut off during rasterizing by ghostscript
resulting in a wrongly calculated bounding box. You can pass
all pre-defined page sizes to <b>-s</b> that ghostscript
understands. These are currently: 11x17, ledger, legal,
letter, lettersmall, archA, archB, archC, archD, archE a0,
a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, isob0, isob1,
isob2, isob3, isob4, isob5, isob6, b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5,
c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, jisb0, jisb1, jisb2, jisb3,
jisb4, jisb5, jisb6, flsa, flse, halfletter. Unfortunately,
all sizes are currently only available in portrait
orientation (not landscape).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
<b>ps2eps</b> uses an already given %%BoundingBox from the
source file, which often corresponds to the size of the
physical page format for which the document was printed.
However, you should be aware that this already specified
bounding box may be not correct, thus resulting in a wrongly
cropped (or even no usable) <i>.eps</i>-file. <b>ps2eps</b>
can only do as good as ghostscript does in rendering the
original postscript file (though <b>ps2eps</b> even works
with negative and fractional values are contained in the
original bounding box by using automatic translation).
Therefore, if the given bounding box is to small or
incorrect anyway, you can ignore the existing bounding box
with the <b>-B</b> option, which will cause ghostscript to
use its internal default size (or use <b>-s</b>). However,
if the BoundingBox has negative coordinates, which is not
allowed by the specification, <b>ps2eps</b> will shift the
output to positive values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hint: to avoid
rotating the picture if you have the original drawing in
landscape format, you may use the &lsquo;&lsquo;Encapsulated
Postscript&rsquo;&rsquo; option in the printer driver which
should generate an EPS file (but with a bounding box of the
sheet size!). But some Windows printer drivers are drawing
the image with an offset from the bottom of the portrait
page, so that a part of it is drawn outside the landscape
oriented page. In this case, you&rsquo;ll have to specify a
square size of the page using the maximum length, e.g.,
29.7cm x 29.7cm for an A4 page.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CLIPPING</b>
<br>
or why gets some of my text deleted above the included
<i>.eps</i> file?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some postscript
drivers draw a white rectangle from the top left corner of
the page to the right lower corner of the object. This may
erase some or even all text above your imported/included EPS
file, which is very annoying. In order to prevent this, most
programs have a clipping option for imported <i>.eps</i>
files (within LaTeX you can use \includegraphics*{}) for
this purpose. If this is unfortunately not the case, you can
use the <b>-C</b> option of <b>ps2eps</b> which will
(hopefully) do it for you. Unfortunately, PScript.dll 5.2
(Windows XP) introduced new very badly behaving Postscript
code (initclip) which will even override the outer clipping!
Thus, a new filter had to be installed in <b>ps2eps</b>
which will fix it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However,
because most programs clip directly on the bounding box, you
still may loose some pixels of your image, because the
bounding box is described in the coarse resolution of
postscript points, i.e. 72 dpi. In order to prevent this,
you can use the <b>-l</b> option or <b>-C</b> option (for
the latter, clipping by the importing program should be
disabled then) to allow for a 1 point larger bounding box.
<b>-C</b> clips around a 1 point enlarged bounding box and
<b>-l</b> enlarges the bounding box values by 1 point (you
can also combine both options).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>INCLUDED
FILTERS</b> <br>
Some postscript sequences, e.g., for using specific printer
features (featurebegin ...), are not working well within an
<i>.eps</i> file, so <b>ps2eps</b> tries to filter them out.
But please note that filters for postscript code may not
work properly for your printer driver (<b>ps2eps</b> was
mainly tested with HP and Adobe printer drivers, although it
may work for all printers using the PScript.dll). In this
case you can try to turn of filtering by using option
<b>-n</b>, or try to find the bad sequence in the postscript
code and adapt the filter rule in the <b>ps2eps</b> script
(variables $linefilter, $rangefilter_begin,
$rangefilter_end; linefilter is an expression for filtering
single lines, rangefilter_... are expressions that filter
all lines between a pattern matching $rangefilter_begin and
$rangefilter_end; drop me an e-mail with your
modifications). However, things may change as the printer
drivers (e.g., PScript.dll) or postscript language
evolve.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some
applications or drivers generate postscript code with
leading or trailing binary code, which often confuses older
postscript interpreters. <b>ps2eps</b> tries to remove such
code, but it may sometimes make a wrong guess about start
and end of the real postscript code (drop me an e-mail with
a zipped postscript source, see section BUGS).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Comment lines
or even blank lines are removed (which is the default to
make .eps files smaller), which may corrupt your output.
Please check the next section how to fix this. <b>ps2eps</b>
removes blank lines and also &lt;CR&gt; (carriage ceturn
&lsquo;&lsquo;\r&rsquo;&rsquo;) at the end of lines.
However, nicely formatted postscript code gives a hint by
using &lsquo;&lsquo;%%BeginBinary&rsquo;&rsquo;
&lsquo;&lsquo;%%EndBinary&rsquo;&rsquo; comments. When
<b>ps2eps</b> detects these comments it will refrain from
any filtering action within the marked binary sections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ps2eps</b>
filters also %%Orientation: comments by default (you can use
option <b>-O</b> to turn off filtering), because ghostscript
may &lsquo;&lsquo;automagically&rsquo;&rsquo; rotate images
when generating PDF images, which is not desired in most
cases. Hint: you can turn off that feature in ghostscript
unconditionally by specifying -dAutoRotatePages=/None.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CORRUPTED
OUTPUT</b> <br>
Some postscript code may get corrupted when comment lines or
even blank lines are removed (which is the default to make
.eps files smaller), because those files may contain encoded
images which also have a % as first character in a line or
use a special comment as end of image delimiter. If this is
the case, use the <b>-c</b> option to prevent filtering
comments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>COLOR AND
MEMORY <br>
ps2eps</b> supports colored postscript, consequently letting
ghostscript consume more resources for drawing its bitmap
(roughly 6MBytes for an A4 page). <b>bbox</b> is reading the
bitmap line by line so it consumes only minimal memory. If
you experience problems with memory consumption of
ghostscript, you may use the <b>-m</b> option for using a
monochrome image. But this will probably result in wrongly
determined bounding boxes with colored images, because
ghostscript has to do black/white dithering and may thus
suppress objects drawn in light colors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another option
in case of memory problems and too long run times is to use
the much more memory efficient internal ghostscript bbox by
using the <b>-g</b> option.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<a name="ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please note
that a command line option always takes precedence over the
related environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The environment
variable PS2EPS_SIZE can be used to specify a default page
size and take any argument that <b>--size</b> accepts.
Examples: <b>export PS2EPS_SIZE=a0</b> (bash-like syntax) or
<b>setenv PS2EPS_SIZE letter</b> (csh syntax).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
environment variable PS2EPS_GSBBOX is set the internal bbox
device of ghostscript will be used instead of the external
command <b>bbox</b>. Examples: <b>export
PS2EPS_GSBBOX=true</b> (bash-like syntax) or <b>setenv
PS2EPS_GSBBOX 1</b> (csh syntax).</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The usual call
is simply: <b>ps2eps -l</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A relatively
failsafe call would be (if your postscript is smaller than
iso b0 [100cm x 141.4cm] and you have a fast computer with
enough memory): <b>ps2eps -l -B -s b0 -c -n</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If output is
not correct try: <b>ps2eps -l -B -s b0 -F</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<h2>AUTHOR

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>ps2eps</b></i>
was written by Roland Bless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>WHY?</b>
<br>
Other programs like <b>ps2epsi</b> do not calculate the
bounding box always correctly (because the values are put on
the postscript stack which may get corrupted by bad
postscript code) or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS
cut off some part of the image. <b>ps2eps</b> uses a double
precision resolution of 144 dpi and appropriate rounding to
get a proper bounding box. The internal bbox device of
ghostscript generates different values (sometimes even
incorrect), so using the provided <b>bbox</b> should be more
robust. However, because normal clipping has only a
resolution of 1/72dpi (postscript point), the clipping
process may still erase parts of your EPS image. In this
case please use the <b>-l</b> option to add an additional
point of white space around the tight bounding box.</p>
