<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-merge-tree
&minus; Perform merge without touching index or working
tree</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
merge&minus;tree</i> [&minus;&minus;write&minus;tree]
[&lt;options&gt;] &lt;branch1&gt; &lt;branch2&gt; <i><br>
git merge&minus;tree</i> [&minus;&minus;trivial&minus;merge]
&lt;base&minus;tree&gt; &lt;branch1&gt; &lt;branch2&gt;
(deprecated)</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command
has a modern <b>&minus;&minus;write&minus;tree</b> mode and
a deprecated <b>&minus;&minus;trivial&minus;merge</b> mode.
With the exception of the DEPRECATED DESCRIPTION section at
the end, the rest of this documentation describes modern
<b>&minus;&minus;write&minus;tree</b> mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Performs a
merge, but does not make any new commits and does not read
from or write to either the working tree or index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The performed
merge will use the same feature as the &quot;real&quot;
<b>git-merge</b>(1), including:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; three
way content merges of individual files</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; rename
detection</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; proper
directory/file conflict handling</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
recursive ancestor consolidation (i.e. when there is more
than one merge base, creating a virtual merge base by
merging the merge bases)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After the merge
completes, a new toplevel tree object is created. See
<b>OUTPUT</b> below for details.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;z</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not quote filenames in the
&lt;Conflicted file info&gt; section, and end each filename
with a NUL character rather than newline. Also begin the
messages section with a NUL character instead of a newline.
See the section called &ldquo;OUTPUT&rdquo; below for more
information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;name&minus;only</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In the Conflicted file info
section, instead of writing a list of (mode, oid, stage,
path) tuples to output for conflicted files, just provide a
list of filenames with conflicts (and do not list filenames
multiple times if they have multiple conflicting
stages).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]messages</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write any informational
messages such as &quot;Auto&minus;merging &lt;path&gt;&quot;
or CONFLICT notices to the end of stdout. If unspecified,
the default is to include these messages if there are merge
conflicts, and to omit them otherwise.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;allow&minus;unrelated&minus;histories</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">merge&minus;tree will by
default error out if the two branches specified share no
common history. This flag can be given to override that
check and make the merge proceed anyway.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;merge&minus;base=&lt;commit&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of finding the
merge&minus;bases for &lt;branch1&gt; and &lt;branch2&gt;,
specify a merge&minus;base for the merge, and specifying
multiple bases is currently not supported. This option is
incompatible with <b>&minus;&minus;stdin</b>.</p>

<h2>OUTPUT
<a name="OUTPUT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a
successful merge, the output from git&minus;merge&minus;tree
is simply one line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;OID of
toplevel tree&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whereas for a
conflicted merge, the output is by default of the form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;OID of
toplevel tree&gt; <br>
&lt;Conflicted file info&gt; <br>
&lt;Informational messages&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are
discussed individually below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, there
is an exception. If <b>&minus;&minus;stdin</b> is passed,
then there is an extra section at the beginning, a NUL
character at the end, and then all the sections repeat for
each line of input. Thus, if the first merge is conflicted
and the second is clean, the output would be of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;Merge
status&gt; <br>
&lt;OID of toplevel tree&gt; <br>
&lt;Conflicted file info&gt; <br>
&lt;Informational messages&gt; <br>
NUL <br>
&lt;Merge status&gt; <br>
&lt;OID of toplevel tree&gt; <br>
NUL</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Merge
status</b> <br>
This is an integer status followed by a NUL character. The
integer status is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">0: merge had
conflicts <br>
1: merge was clean <br>
&amp;lt;0: something prevented the merge from running (e.g.
access to repository <br>
objects denied by filesystem)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>OID of
toplevel tree</b> <br>
This is a tree object that represents what would be checked
out in the working tree at the end of <b>git merge</b>. If
there were conflicts, then files within this tree may have
embedded conflict markers. This section is always followed
by a newline (or NUL if <b>&minus;z</b> is passed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Conflicted
file info</b> <br>
This is a sequence of lines with the format</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;mode&gt;
&lt;object&gt; &lt;stage&gt; &lt;filename&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The filename
will be quoted as explained for the configuration variable
<b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). However,
if the <b>&minus;&minus;name&minus;only</b> option is
passed, the mode, object, and stage will be omitted. If
<b>&minus;z</b> is passed, the &quot;lines&quot; are
terminated by a NUL character instead of a newline
character.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Informational
messages</b> <br>
This section provides informational messages, typically
about conflicts. The format of the section varies
significantly depending on whether <b>&minus;z</b> is
passed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&minus;z</b> is passed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output
format is zero or more conflict informational records, each
of the form:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;list&minus;of&minus;paths&gt;&lt;conflict&minus;type&gt;NUL&lt;conflict&minus;message&gt;NUL</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">where
&lt;list&minus;of&minus;paths&gt; is of the form</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;number&minus;of&minus;paths&gt;NUL&lt;path1&gt;NUL&lt;path2&gt;NUL...&lt;pathN&gt;NUL</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and includes
paths (or branch names) affected by the conflict or
informational message in &lt;conflict&minus;message&gt;.
Also, &lt;conflict&minus;type&gt; is a stable string
explaining the type of conflict, such as</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;Auto&minus;merging&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;CONFLICT (rename/delete)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;CONFLICT (submodule lacks merge base)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;CONFLICT (binary)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and
&lt;conflict&minus;message&gt; is a more detailed message
about the conflict which often (but not always) embeds the
&lt;stable&minus;short&minus;type&minus;description&gt;
within it. These strings may change in future Git versions.
Some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;Auto&minus;merging &lt;file&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;CONFLICT (rename/delete): &lt;oldfile&gt;
renamed...but deleted in...&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;Failed to merge submodule &lt;submodule&gt; (no merge
base)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
&quot;Warning: cannot merge binary files:
&lt;filename&gt;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&minus;z</b> is NOT passed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
starts with a blank line to separate it from the previous
sections, and then only contains the
&lt;conflict&minus;message&gt; information from the previous
section (separated by newlines). These are non&minus;stable
strings that should not be parsed by scripts, and are just
meant for human consumption. Also, note that while
&lt;conflict&minus;message&gt; strings usually do not
contain embedded newlines, they sometimes do. (However, the
free&minus;form messages will never have an embedded NUL
character). So, the entire block of information is meant for
human readers as an agglomeration of all conflict
messages.</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a
successful, non&minus;conflicted merge, the exit status is
0. When the merge has conflicts, the exit status is 1. If
the merge is not able to complete (or start) due to some
kind of error, the exit status is something other than 0 or
1 (and the output is unspecified). When &minus;&minus;stdin
is passed, the return status is 0 for both successful and
conflicted merges, and something other than 0 or 1 if it
cannot complete all the requested merges.</p>

<h2>USAGE NOTES
<a name="USAGE NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
intended as low&minus;level plumbing, similar to
<b>git-hash-object</b>(1), <b>git-mktree</b>(1),
<b>git-commit-tree</b>(1), <b>git-write-tree</b>(1),
<b>git-update-ref</b>(1), and <b>git-mktag</b>(1). Thus, it
can be used as a part of a series of steps such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">NEWTREE=$(git
merge&minus;tree &minus;&minus;write&minus;tree $BRANCH1
$BRANCH2) <br>
test $? &minus;eq 0 || die &quot;There were
conflicts...&quot; <br>
NEWCOMMIT=$(git commit&minus;tree $NEWTREE &minus;p $BRANCH1
&minus;p $BRANCH2) <br>
git update&minus;ref $BRANCH1 $NEWCOMMIT</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
the exit status is non&minus;zero, <b>NEWTREE</b> in this
sequence will contain a lot more output than just a
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For conflicts,
the output includes the same information that you&rsquo;d
get with <b>git-merge</b>(1):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; what
would be written to the working tree (the OID of toplevel
tree)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; the
higher order stages that would be written to the index (the
Conflicted file info)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; any
messages that would have been printed to stdout (the
Informational messages)</p>

<h2>INPUT FORMAT
<a name="INPUT FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
merge&minus;tree &minus;&minus;stdin</i> input format is
fully text based. Each line has this format:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[&lt;base&minus;commit&gt;
&minus;&minus; ]&lt;branch1&gt; &lt;branch2&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If one line is
separated by <b>&minus;&minus;</b>, the string before the
separator is used for specifying a merge&minus;base for the
merge and the string after the separator describes the
branches to be merged.</p>

<h2>MISTAKES TO AVOID
<a name="MISTAKES TO AVOID"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Do NOT look
through the resulting toplevel tree to try to find which
files conflict; parse the Conflicted file info section
instead. Not only would parsing an entire tree be
horrendously slow in large repositories, there are numerous
types of conflicts not representable by conflict markers
(modify/delete, mode conflict, binary file changed on both
sides, file/directory conflicts, various rename conflict
permutations, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Do NOT
interpret an empty Conflicted file info list as a clean
merge; check the exit status. A merge can have conflicts
without having individual files conflict (there are a few
types of directory rename conflicts that fall into this
category, and others might also be added in the future).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Do NOT attempt
to guess or make the user guess the conflict types from the
Conflicted file info list. The information there is
insufficient to do so. For example: Rename/rename(1to2)
conflicts (both sides renamed the same file differently)
will result in three different file having higher order
stages (but each only has one higher order stage), with no
way (short of the Informational messages section) to
determine which three files are related. File/directory
conflicts also result in a file with exactly one higher
order stage.
Possibly&minus;involved&minus;in&minus;directory&minus;rename
conflicts (when &quot;merge.directoryRenames&quot; is unset
or set to &quot;conflicts&quot;) also result in a file with
exactly one higher order stage. In all cases, the
Informational messages section has the necessary info,
though it is not designed to be machine parseable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Do NOT assume
that each paths from Conflicted file info, and the logical
conflicts in the Informational messages have a
one&minus;to&minus;one mapping, nor that there is a
one&minus;to&minus;many mapping, nor a
many&minus;to&minus;one mapping. Many&minus;to&minus;many
mappings exist, meaning that each path can have many logical
conflict types in a single merge, and each logical conflict
type can affect many paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Do NOT assume
all filenames listed in the Informational messages section
had conflicts. Messages can be included for files that have
no conflicts, such as &quot;Auto&minus;merging
&lt;file&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AVOID taking
the OIDS from the Conflicted file info and re&minus;merging
them to present the conflicts to the user. This will lose
information. Instead, look up the version of the file found
within the OID of toplevel tree and show that instead. In
particular, the latter will have conflict markers annotated
with the original branch/commit being merged and, if renames
were involved, the original filename. While you could
include the original branch/commit in the conflict marker
annotations when re&minus;merging, the original filename is
not available from the Conflicted file info and thus you
would be losing information that might help the user resolve
the conflict.</p>

<h2>DEPRECATED DESCRIPTION
<a name="DEPRECATED DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Per the
DESCRIPTION and unlike the rest of this documentation, this
section describes the deprecated
<b>&minus;&minus;trivial&minus;merge</b> mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other than the
optional <b>&minus;&minus;trivial&minus;merge</b>, this mode
accepts no options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This mode reads
three tree&minus;ish, and outputs trivial merge results and
conflicting stages to the standard output in a
semi&minus;diff format. Since this was designed for higher
level scripts to consume and merge the results back into the
index, it omits entries that match &lt;branch1&gt;. The
result of this second form is similar to what
three&minus;way <i>git read&minus;tree &minus;m</i> does,
but instead of storing the results in the index, the command
outputs the entries to the standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This form not
only has limited applicability (a trivial merge cannot
handle content merges of individual files, rename detection,
proper directory/file conflict handling, etc.), the output
format is also difficult to work with, and it will generally
be less performant than the first form even on successful
merges (especially if working in large repositories).</p>
