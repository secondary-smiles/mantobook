<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
project takes security issues seriously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
responsibility for handling security reports in a timely and
effective manner has been delegated to a security team
composed of a subset of the Perl core developers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes how the Perl security team operates and how the
team evaluates new security reports.</p>

<h2>REPORTING SECURITY ISSUES IN PERL
<a name="REPORTING SECURITY ISSUES IN PERL"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
you have found a security vulnerability in the Perl
interpreter or modules maintained in the core Perl codebase,
email the details to perl&minus;security@perl.org
&lt;mailto:perl-security@perl.org&gt;. This address is a
closed membership mailing list monitored by the Perl
security team.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should
receive an initial response to your report within 72 hours.
If you do not receive a response in that time, please
contact the Perl Steering Council
&lt;mailto:steering-council@perl.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When members of
the security team reply to your messages, they will
generally include the perl&minus;security@perl.org address
in the &quot;To&quot; or &quot; <small>CC&quot;</small>
fields of the response. This allows all of the security team
to follow the discussion and chime in as needed. Use the
&quot;Reply-all&quot; functionality of your email client
when you send subsequent responses so that the entire
security team receives the message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
team will evaluate your report and make an initial
determination of whether it is likely to fit the scope of
issues the team handles. General guidelines about how this
is determined are detailed in the &quot; <small>WHAT ARE
SECURITY ISSUES&quot;</small> section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your report
meets the team&rsquo;s criteria, an issue will be opened in
the team&rsquo;s private issue tracker and you will be
provided the issue&rsquo;s <small>ID</small> number. Issue
identifiers have the form perl&minus;security#NNN. Include
this identifier with any subsequent messages you send.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
team will send periodic updates about the status of your
issue and guide you through any further action that is
required to complete the vulnerability remediation process.
The stages vulnerabilities typically go through are
explained in the &quot; <small>HOW WE DEAL WITH SECURITY
ISSUES&quot;</small> section.</p>

<h2>WHAT ARE SECURITY ISSUES
<a name="WHAT ARE SECURITY ISSUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A vulnerability
is a behavior of a software system that compromises the
system&rsquo;s expected confidentiality, integrity or
availability protections.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A security
issue is a bug in one or more specific components of a
software system that creates a vulnerability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Software
written in the Perl programming language is typically
composed of many layers of software written by many
different groups. It can be very complicated to determine
which specific layer of a complex real-world application was
responsible for preventing a vulnerable behavior, but this
is an essential part of fixing the vulnerability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files under the
<i>cpan/</i> directory in Perl&rsquo;s repository and
release tarballs are developed and maintained independently.
The Perl security team does not directly handle security
issues for these modules, but since this code is bundled
with Perl, we will assist in forwarding the issue to the
relevant maintainer(s) and you can still report these issues
to us in secrecy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bugs that
may qualify as security issues in Perl</b> <br>
Perl is designed to be a fast and flexible general purpose
programming language. The Perl interpreter and Perl modules
make writing safe and secure applications easy, but they do
have limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a general
rule, a bug in Perl needs to meet all of the following
criteria to be considered a security issue:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bugs that do
not qualify as security issues in Perl</b> <br>
There are certain categories of bugs that are frequently
reported to the security team that do not meet the criteria
listed above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
is a list of commonly reported bugs that are not handled as
security issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Feeding
untrusted code to the interpreter</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl parser
is not designed to evaluate untrusted code. If your
application requires the evaluation of untrusted code, it
should rely on an operating system level sandbox for its
security.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Stack
overflows due to excessive recursion</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Excessive
recursion is often caused by code that does not enforce
limits on inputs. The Perl interpreter assumes limits on
recursion will be enforced by the application.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Out of
memory errors</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Common Perl
constructs such as &quot;pack&quot;, the &quot;x&quot;
operator, and regular expressions accept numeric quantifiers
that control how much memory will be allocated to store
intermediate values or results. If you allow an attacker to
supply these quantifiers and consume all available memory,
the Perl interpreter will not prevent it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Escape from
a Safe compartment</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Opcode
restrictions and Safe compartments are not supported as
security mechanisms. The Perl parser is not designed to
evaluate untrusted code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Use of the
&quot;p&quot; and &quot;P&quot; pack templates</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These templates
are unsafe by design.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Stack not
reference-counted issues</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These bugs
typically present as use-after-free errors or as assertion
failures on the type of a &quot;SV&quot;. Stack not
reference-counted crashes usually occur because code is both
modifying a reference or glob and using the values
referenced by that glob or reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This type of
bug is a long standing issue with the Perl interpreter that
seldom occurs in normal code. Examples of this type of bug
generally assume that attacker-supplied code will be
evaluated by the Perl interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Thawing
attacker-supplied data with Storable</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Storable is
designed to be a very fast serialization format. It is not
designed to be safe for deserializing untrusted inputs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Using
attacker supplied SDBM_File databases</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SDBM_File
module is not intended for use with untrusted
<small>SDBM</small> databases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Badly
encoded <small>UTF&minus;8</small> flagged scalars</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This type of
bug occurs when the &quot;:utf8&quot; PerlIO layer is used
to read badly encoded data, or other mechanisms are used to
directly manipulate the <small>UTF&minus;8</small> flag on
an <small>SV.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A badly encoded
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> flagged <small>SV</small> is not
a valid <small>SV.</small> Code that creates
<small>SV</small> &rsquo;s in this fashion is corrupting
Perl&rsquo;s internal state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Issues that
exist only in blead, or in a release candidate</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The blead
branch and Perl release candidates do not receive security
support. Security defects that are present only in
pre-release versions of Perl are handled through the normal
bug reporting and resolution process.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>CPAN</small>
modules or other Perl project resources</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
security team is focused on the Perl interpreter and modules
maintained in the core Perl codebase. The team has no
special access to fix <small>CPAN</small> modules,
applications written in Perl, Perl project websites, Perl
mailing lists or the Perl <small>IRC</small> servers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Emulated
<small>POSIX</small> behaviors on Windows systems</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
interpreter attempts to emulate &quot;fork&quot;,
&quot;system&quot;, &quot;exec&quot; and other
<small>POSIX</small> behaviors on Windows systems. This
emulation has many quirks that are extensively documented in
Perl&rsquo;s public issue tracker. Changing these behaviors
would cause significant disruption for existing users on
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bugs that
require special categorization</b> <br>
Some bugs in the Perl interpreter occur in areas of the
codebase that are both security sensitive and prone to
failure during normal usage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Regular
expressions</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Untrusted
regular expressions are generally safe to compile and match
against with several caveats. The following behaviors of
Perl&rsquo;s regular expression engine are the
developer&rsquo;s responsibility to constrain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The evaluation
of untrusted regular expressions while &quot;use re
'eval';&quot; is in effect is never safe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Regular
expressions are not guaranteed to compile or evaluate in any
specific finite time frame.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Regular
expressions may consume all available system memory when
they are compiled or evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Regular
expressions may cause excessive recursion that halts the
perl interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a general
rule, do not expect Perl&rsquo;s regular expression engine
to be resistant to denial of service attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>DB_File,
ODBM_File, or GDBM_File databases</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These modules
rely on external libraries to interact with database
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bugs caused by
reading and writing these file formats are generally caused
by the underlying library implementation and are not
security issues in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bugs where Perl
mishandles unexpected valid return values from the
underlying libraries may qualify as security issues in
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Algorithmic
complexity attacks</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The perl
interpreter is reasonably robust to algorithmic complexity
attacks. It is not immune to them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Algorithmic
complexity bugs that depend on the interpreter processing
extremely large amounts of attacker supplied data are not
generally handled as security issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec for
additional information.</p>

<h2>HOW WE DEAL WITH SECURITY ISSUES
<a name="HOW WE DEAL WITH SECURITY ISSUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
security team follows responsible disclosure practices.
Security issues are kept secret until a fix is readily
available for most users. This minimizes inherent risks
users face from vulnerabilities in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hiding problems
from the users temporarily is a necessary trade-off to keep
them safe. Hiding problems from users permanently is not the
goal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you report
a security issue privately to the
perl&minus;security@perl.org
&lt;mailto:perl-security@perl.org&gt; contact address, we
normally expect you to follow responsible disclosure
practices in the handling of the report. If you are unable
or unwilling to keep the issue secret until a fix is
available to users you should state this clearly in the
initial report.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
team&rsquo;s vulnerability remediation workflow is intended
to be as open and transparent as possible about the state of
your security report.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl&rsquo;s
vulnerability remediation workflow</b> <i><br>
Initial contact</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">New
vulnerability reports will receive an initial reply within
72 hours from the time they arrive at the security
team&rsquo;s mailing list. If you do not receive any
response in that time, contact the Perl Steering Council
&lt;mailto:steering-council@perl.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The initial
response sent by the security team will confirm your message
was received and provide an estimated time frame for the
security team&rsquo;s triage analysis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Initial
triage</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
team will evaluate the report and determine whether or not
it is likely to meet the criteria for handling as a security
issue.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
team aims to complete the initial report triage within two
weeks&rsquo; time. Complex issues that require significant
discussion or research may take longer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the security
report cannot be reproduced or does not meet the
team&rsquo;s criteria for handling as a security issue, you
will be notified by email and given an opportunity to
respond.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Issue
<small>ID</small> assignment</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Security
reports that pass initial triage analysis are turned into
issues in the security team&rsquo;s private issue tracker.
When a report progresses to this point you will be provided
the issue <small>ID</small> for future reference. These
identifiers have the format perl&minus;security#NNN or
Perl/perl&minus;security#NNN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The assignment
of an issue <small>ID</small> does not confirm that a
security report represents a vulnerability in Perl. Many
reports require further analysis to reach that
determination.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Issues in the
security team&rsquo;s private tracker are used to collect
details about the problem and track progress towards a
resolution. These notes and other details are not made
public when the issue is resolved. Keeping the issue notes
private allows the security team to freely discuss attack
methods, attack tools, and other related private issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Development
of patches</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Members of the
security team will inspect the report and related code in
detail to produce fixes for supported versions of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the team
discovers that the reported issue does not meet the
team&rsquo;s criteria at this stage, you will be notified by
email and given an opportunity to respond before the issue
is closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The team may
discuss potential fixes with you or provide you with patches
for testing purposes during this time frame. No information
should be shared publicly at this stage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><small>CVE
ID</small> assignment</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once an issue
is fully confirmed and a potential fix has been found, the
security team will request a <small>CVE</small> identifier
for the issue to use in public announcements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Details like
the range of vulnerable Perl versions and identities of the
people that discovered the flaw need to be collected to
submit the <small>CVE ID</small> request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
team may ask you to clarify the exact name we should use
when crediting discovery of the issue. The
&quot;Vulnerability credit and bounties&quot; section of
this document explains our preferred format for this
credit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once a
<small>CVE ID</small> has been assigned, you will be
notified by email. The vulnerability should not be discussed
publicly at this stage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Pre-release
notifications</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
security team is satisfied that the fix for a security issue
is ready to release publicly, a pre-release notification
announcement is sent to the major redistributors of
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
pre-release announcement includes a list of Perl versions
that are affected by the flaw, an analysis of the risks to
users, patches the security team has produced, and any
information about mitigations or backporting fixes to older
versions of Perl that the security team has available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pre-release
announcement will include a specific target date when the
issue will be announced publicly. The time frame between the
pre-release announcement and the release date allows
redistributors to prepare and test their own updates and
announcements. During this period the vulnerability details
and fixes are embargoed and should not be shared publicly.
This embargo period may be extended further if problems are
discovered during testing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You will be
sent the portions of pre-release announcements that are
relevant to the specific issue you reported. This email will
include the target release date. Additional updates will be
sent if the target release date changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Pre-release
testing</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
security team does not directly produce official Perl
releases. The team releases security fixes by placing
commits in Perl&rsquo;s public git repository and sending
announcements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many users and
redistributors prefer using official Perl releases rather
than applying patches to an older release. The security team
works with Perl&rsquo;s release managers to make this
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">New official
releases of Perl are generally produced and tested on
private systems during the pre-release embargo period.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Release of
fixes and announcements</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the end of
the embargo period the security fixes will be committed to
Perl&rsquo;s public git repository and announcements will be
sent to the perl5&minus;porters
&lt;https://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html&gt; and
oss-security
&lt;https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security&gt;
mailing lists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If official
Perl releases are ready, they will be published at this time
and announced on the perl5&minus;porters
&lt;https://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html&gt;
mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
team will send a follow-up notification to everyone that
participated in the pre-release embargo period once the
release process is finished. Vulnerability reporters and
Perl redistributors should not publish their own
announcements or fixes until the Perl security team&rsquo;s
release process is complete.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Publicly
known and zero-day security issues</b> <br>
The security team&rsquo;s vulnerability remediation workflow
assumes that issues are reported privately and kept secret
until they are resolved. This isn&rsquo;t always the case
and information occasionally leaks out before a fix is
ready.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In these
situations the team must decide whether operating in secret
increases or decreases the risk to users of Perl. In some
cases being open about the risk a security issue creates
will allow users to defend against it, in other cases
calling attention to an unresolved security issue will make
it more likely to be misused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Zero-day
security issues</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an
unresolved critical security issue in Perl is being actively
abused to attack systems the security team will send out
announcements as rapidly as possible with any mitigations
the team has available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
public defect tracker will be used to handle the issue so
that additional information, fixes, and <small>CVE</small>
IDs are visible to affected users as rapidly as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Other leaks
of security issue information</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Depending on
the prominence of the information revealed about a security
issue and the issue&rsquo;s risk of becoming a zero-day
attack, the security team may skip all or part of its normal
remediation workflow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the security
team learns of a significant security issue after it has
been identified and resolved in Perl&rsquo;s public issue
tracker, the team will request a <small>CVE ID</small> and
send an announcement to inform users.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Vulnerability
credit and bounties</b> <br>
The Perl project appreciates the effort security researchers
invest in making Perl safe and secure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since much of
this work is hidden from the public, crediting researchers
publicly is an important part of the vulnerability
remediation process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Credits in
vulnerability announcements</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When security
issues are fixed we will attempt to credit the specific
researcher(s) that discovered the flaw in our
announcements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Credits are
announced using the researcher&rsquo;s preferred full
name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
researcher&rsquo;s contributions were funded by a specific
company or part of an organized vulnerability research
project, we will include a short name for this group at the
