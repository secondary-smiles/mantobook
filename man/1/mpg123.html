</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mpg123</b>
reads one or more <i>file</i>s (or standard input if
&lsquo;&lsquo;&minus;&rsquo;&rsquo; is specified) or
<i>URL</i>s and plays them on the audio device (default) or
outputs them to stdout. <i>file</i>/<i>URL</i> is assumed to
be an MPEG audio bit stream.</p>

If a dash &lsquo;&lsquo;&minus;&rsquo;&rsquo; is specified,
MPEG data will be read from the standard input. Furthermore,
any name starting with &lsquo;&lsquo;http://&rsquo;&rsquo;
or &lsquo;&lsquo;https://&rsquo;&rsquo; is recognized as

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mpg123</b>
options may be either the traditional POSIX one letter
options, or the GNU style long options. POSIX style options
start with a single &lsquo;&lsquo;&minus;&rsquo;&rsquo;,
while GNU long options start with
&lsquo;&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&rsquo;&rsquo;. Option arguments
(if needed) follow separated by whitespace (not
&lsquo;&lsquo;=&rsquo;&rsquo;). Note that some options can
be absent from your installation when disabled in the build
process.</p>

<h2>INPUT OPTIONS
<a name="INPUT OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;k</b>
<i>num</i>, <b>&minus;&minus;skip</b> <i>num</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Skip first <i>num</i> frames.
By default the decoding starts at the first frame.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;n</b> <i>num</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;frames</b> <i>num</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Decode only <i>num</i> frames.
By default the complete stream is decoded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fuzzy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable fuzzy seeks (guessing
byte offsets or using approximate seek points from Xing
TOC). Without that, seeks need a first scan through the file
before they can jump at positions. You can decide here:
sample-accurate operation with gapless features or faster
(fuzzy) seeking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;y</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;resync</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do NOT try to resync and
continue decoding if an error occurs in the input file.
Normally, <b>mpg123</b> tries to keep the playback alive at
all costs, including skipping invalid material and searching
new header when something goes wrong. With this switch you
can make it bail out on data errors (and perhaps spare your
ears a bad time). Note that this switch has been renamed
from &minus;&minus;resync. The old name still works, but is
not advertised or recommended to use (subject to removal in
future).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;F</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;frankenstein</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable support for
Frankenstein streams. Normally, mpg123 stays true to the
concept of MPEG audio being just a concatenation of MPEG
frames. It will continue decoding even if the type of MPEG
frames varies wildly. With this switch, it will only decode
the input as long as it does not change its character (from
layer I to layer III, changing sampling rate, from mono to
stereo), silently assuming end of stream on such occasion.
The switch also stops decoding of compatible MPEG frames if
there was an Info frame (Xing header, Lame tag) that
contained a length of the track in MPEG frames. This comes a
bit closer to the notion of a MP3 file as a defined
collection of MPEG frames that belong together, but gets rid
of the flexibility that can be fun at times but mostly is
hell for the programmer of the parser and decoder ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;network</b>
<i>backend</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select network backend (helper
program), choices are usually auto, wget, and curl. Auto
means to try the first available backend.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;-resync&minus;limit</b>
<i>bytes</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set number of bytes to search
for valid MPEG data once lost in stream; &lt;0 means search
whole stream. If you know there are huge chunks of invalid
data in your files... here is your hammer. Note: Only since
version 1.14 this also increases the amount of junk skipped
on beginning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;u</b> <i>auth</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;auth</b> <i>auth</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">HTTP authentication to use when
receiving files via HTTP. The format used is user:password.
Mpg123 will clear this quickly, but it may still appear in
sight of other users or even just in your shell history. You
may seek alternative ways to specify that to your network
backend.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;auth-file</b>
<i>authfile</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Provide the authentication info
via given file instead of command line directly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;mime</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Ignore MIME types given by HTTP
server. If you know better and want mpg123 to decode
something the server thinks is image/png, then just do
it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;icy&minus;meta</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not accept ICY meta
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;-streamdump</b>
<i>filename</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Dump a copy of the input data
(as read by libmpg123) to the given file. This enables you
to store a web stream to disk while playing, or just create
a concatenation of the local files you play for ... why
not?</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;-icy&minus;interval</b>
<i>bytes</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This setting enables you to
play a stream dump containing ICY metadata at the given
interval in bytes (the value of the icy-metaint HTTP
response header). Without it, such a stream will play, but
will cause regular decoding glitches with resync.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;seekbuffer</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable the default
micro-buffering of non-seekable streams that gives the
parser a safer footing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;@</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;list</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read filenames and/or URLs of
MPEG audio streams from the specified <i>file</i> in
addition to the ones specified on the command line (if any).
Note that <i>file</i> can be either an ordinary file, a dash
&lsquo;&lsquo;&minus;&rsquo;&rsquo; to indicate that a list
of filenames/URLs is to be read from the standard input, or
an URL pointing to a an appropriate list file. Note: only
one <b>&minus;@</b> option can be used (if more than one is
specified, only the last one will be recognized).
Furthermore, for HTTP resources, the MIME type information
will be used to re-open an actual MPEG stream as such
instead of treating it as playlist file. So you could just
always use <b>&minus;@</b> for web resources without
bothering if it is a playlist or already the resolved stream
address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;l</b> <i>n</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;listentry</b> <i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Of the playlist, play specified
entry only. <i>n</i> is the number of entry starting at 1. A
value of 0 is the default and means playing the whole list,
a negative value means showing of the list of titles with
their numbers...</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;continue</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable playlist continuation
mode. This changes frame skipping to apply only to the first
track and also continues to play following tracks in
playlist after the selected one. Also, the option to play a
number of frames only applies to the whole playlist.
Basically, this tries to treat the playlist more like one
big stream (like, an audio book). The current track number
in list (1-based) and frame number (0-based) are printed at
exit (useful if you interrupted playback and want to
continue later). Note that the continuation info is printed
to standard output unless the switch for piping audio data
to standard out is used. Also, it really makes sense to work
with actual playlist files instead of lists of file names as
arguments, to keep track positions consistent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;loop</b>
<i>times</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">for looping track(s) a certain
number of times, &lt; 0 means infinite loop (not with
&minus;&minus;random!).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;keep&minus;open</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For remote control mode: Keep
loaded file open after reaching end.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;timeout</b>
<i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Timeout in (integer) seconds
before declaring a stream dead (if &lt;= 0, wait
forever).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;z</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;shuffle</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Shuffle play. Randomly shuffles
the order of files specified on the command line, or in the
list file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;Z</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;random</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Continuous random play. Keeps
picking a random file from the command line or the play
list. Unlike shuffle play above, random play never ends, and
plays individual songs more than once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;i,
&minus;-index</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Index / scan through the track
before playback. This fills the index table for seeking (if
enabled in libmpg123) and may make the operating system
cache the file contents for smoother operating on
playback.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;index&minus;size</b>
<i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the number of entries in
the seek frame index table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;preframes</b>
<i>num</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the number of frames to be
read as lead-in before a seeked-to position. This serves to
fill the layer 3 bit reservoir, which is needed to
faithfully reproduce a certain sample at a certain position.
Note that for layer 3, a minimum of 1 is enforced (because
of frame overlap), and for layer 1 and 2, this is limited to
2 (no bit reservoir in that case, but engine spin-up
anyway).</p>

<h2>OUTPUT and PROCESSING OPTIONS
<a name="OUTPUT and PROCESSING OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;o</b>
<i>module</i>, <b>&minus;&minus;output</b> <i>module</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select audio output module. You
can provide a comma-separated list to use the first one that
works. Also see <b>&minus;a</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;list&minus;modules</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the available modules.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;list&minus;devices</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">List the available output
devices for given output module. If there is no
functionality to list devices in the chosen module, an error
will be printed and mpg123 will exit with a non-zero
code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;a</b> <i>dev</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;audiodevice</b> <i>dev</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the audio device to
use. The default as well as the possible values depend on
the active output. For the JACK output, a comma-separated
list of ports to connect to (for each channel) can be
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;stdout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The decoded audio samples are
written to standard output, instead of playing them through
the audio device. This option must be used if your audio
hardware is not supported by <b>mpg123</b>. The output
format per default is raw (headerless) linear PCM audio
data, 16 bit, stereo, host byte order (you can force mono or
8bit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;O</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;outfile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Write raw output into a file
(instead of simply redirecting standard output to a file
with the shell).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;w</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;wav</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Write output as WAV file. This
will cause the MPEG stream to be decoded and saved as file
<i>file</i> , or standard output if <i>-</i> is used as file
name. You can also use <i>--au</i> and <i>--cdr</i> for AU
and CDR format, respectively. Note that WAV/AU writing to
non-seekable files, or redirected stdout, needs some
thought. Since 1.16.0, the logic changed to writing the
header with the first actual data. This avoids spurious WAV
headers in a pipe, for example. The result of decoding
nothing to WAV/AU is a file consisting just of the header
when it is seekable and really nothing when not (not even a
header). Correctly writing data with prophetic headers to
stdout is no easy business.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;au</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Does not play the MPEG file but
writes it to <i>file</i> in SUN audio format. If &minus; is
used as the filename, the AU file is written to stdout. See
paragraph about WAV writing for header fun with non-seekable
streams.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;cdr</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Does not play the MPEG file but
writes it to <i>file</i> as a CDR file. If &minus; is used
as the filename, the CDR file is written to stdout.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;reopen</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Forces reopen of the
audiodevice after ever song</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;cpu&nbsp;</b><i>decoder&minus;type</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Selects a certain decoder
(optimized for specific CPU), for example i586 or MMX. The
list of available decoders can vary; depending on the build
and what your CPU supports. This option is only available
when the build actually includes several optimized
decoders.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;test&minus;cpu</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tests your CPU and prints a
list of possible choices for &minus;&minus;cpu.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;list&minus;cpu</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Lists all available decoder
choices, regardless of support by your CPU.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;g</b> <i>gain</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;gain</b> <i>gain</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">[DEPRECATED] Set audio hardware
output gain (default: don&rsquo;t change). The unit of the
gain value is hardware and output module dependent. (This
parameter is only provided for backwards compatibility and
may be removed in the future without prior notice. Use the
audio player for playing and a mixer app for mixing, UNIX
style!)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;f</b> <i>factor</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;scale</b> <i>factor</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Change scale factor (default:
32768).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rva-mix,&nbsp;&minus;&minus;rva-radio</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable RVA (relative volume
adjustment) using the values stored for ReplayGain radio
mode / mix mode with all tracks roughly equal loudness. The
first valid information found in ID3V2 Tags (Comment named
RVA or the RVA2 frame) or ReplayGain header in Lame/Info Tag
is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rva-album,&nbsp;&minus;&minus;rva-audiophile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable RVA (relative volume
adjustment) using the values stored for ReplayGain
audiophile mode / album mode with usually the effect of
adjusting album loudness but keeping relative loudness
inside album. The first valid information found in ID3V2
Tags (Comment named RVA_ALBUM or the RVA2 frame) or
ReplayGain header in Lame/Info Tag is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;0</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;single0</b>; <b>&minus;1</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;single1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Decode only channel 0 (left) or
channel 1 (right), respectively. These options are available
for stereo MPEG streams only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;m</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;mono</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;mix</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;singlemix</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mix both channels / decode
mono. It takes less CPU time than full stereo decoding.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;stereo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force stereo output</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;r</b> <i>rate</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;rate</b> <i>rate</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set sample rate (default:
automatic). You may want to change this if you need a
constant bitrate independent of the mpeg stream rate. mpg123
automagically converts the rate. You should then combine
this with &minus;&minus;stereo or &minus;&minus;mono.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;resample</b>
<i>method</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set resampling method to employ
if forcing an output rate. Choices (case-insensitive) are
NtoM, dirty, and fine. The fine resampler is the default. It
employs libsyn123&rsquo;s low-latency fairly efficient
resampler to postprocess the output from libmpg123 instead
of the fast but very crude NtoM decoder (drop sample method)
that mpg123 offers since decades. If you are really low on
CPU time, choose NtoM, as the resampler usually needs more
time than the MPEG decoder itself. The mpg123 program is
smart enough to combine the 2to1 or 4to1 downsampling modes
with the postprocessing for extreme downsampling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;2</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;2to1</b>; <b>&minus;4</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;4to1</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Performs a downsampling of
ratio 2:1 (22 kHz from 44.1 kHz) or 4:1 (11 kHz) on the
output stream, respectively. Saves some CPU cycles, but of
course throws away the high frequencies, as the decoder does
not bother producing them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;pitch&nbsp;</b><i>value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set a pitch change
(speedup/down, 0 is neutral; 0.05 is 5% speedup). When not
enforcing an output rate, this changes the output sampling
rate, so it only works in the range your audio
system/hardware supports. When you combine this with a fixed
output rate, it modifies a software resampling ratio
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;float</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Forces f32 encoding</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;e</b> <i>enc</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;encoding</b> <i>enc</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Choose output sample encoding.
Possible values look like f32 (32-bit floating point), s32
(32-bit signed integer), u32 (32-bit unsigned integer) and
the variants with different numbers of bits (s24, u24, s16,
u16, s8, u8) and also special variants like ulaw and alaw
8-bit. See the output of mpg123&rsquo;s longhelp for
actually available encodings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;d</b> <i>n</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;doublespeed</b> <i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Only play every
<i>n</i>&rsquo;th frame. This will cause the MPEG stream to
be played <i>n</i> times faster, which can be used for
special effects. Can also be combined with the
<b>&minus;&minus;halfspeed</b> option to play 3 out of 4
frames etc. Don&rsquo;t expect great sound quality when
using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;h</b> <i>n</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;halfspeed</b> <i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Play each frame <i>n</i> times.
This will cause the MPEG stream to be played at
<i>1</i>/<i>n</i>&rsquo;th speed (n times slower), which can
be used for special effects. Can also be combined with the
<b>&minus;&minus;doublespeed</b> option to double every
third frame or things like that. Don&rsquo;t expect great
sound quality when using this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;E</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;equalizer</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enables equalization, taken
from <i>file</i>. The file needs to contain 32 lines of
data, additional comment lines may be prefixed with
<i>#</i>. Each data line consists of two floating-point
entries, separated by whitespace. They specify the
multipliers for left and right channel of a certain
frequency band, respectively. The first line corresponds to
the lowest, the 32nd to the highest frequency band. Note
that you can control the equalizer interactively with the
generic control interface. Also note that these are the 32
bands of the MPEG codec, not spaced like you would see for a
usual graphic equalizer. The upside is that there is zero
computational cost in addition to decoding. The downside is
that you roughly have bass in band 0, (upper) mids in band
1, treble in all others.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;gapless</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable code that cuts (junk)
samples at beginning and end of tracks, enabling gapless
transitions between MPEG files when encoder padding and
codec delays would prevent it. This is enabled per default
beginning with mpg123 version 1.0.0 .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;gapless</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable the gapless code. That
gives you MP3 decodings that include encoder delay and
padding plus mpg123&rsquo;s decoder delay.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;infoframe</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not parse the
Xing/Lame/VBR/Info frame, decode it instead just like a
stupid old MP3 hardware player. This implies disabling of
gapless playback as the necessary information is in said
metadata frame.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;D</b> <i>n</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;delay</b> <i>n</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Insert a delay of <i>n</i>
seconds before each track.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;o h</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;headphones</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Direct audio output to the
headphone connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;o s</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;speaker</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Direct audio output to the
speaker (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;o l</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;lineout</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Direct audio output to the
line-out connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;b</b> <i>size</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;buffer</b> <i>size</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use an audio output buffer of
<i>size</i> Kbytes. This is useful to bypass short periods
of heavy system activity, which would normally cause the
audio output to be interrupted. You should specify a buffer
size of at least 1024 (i.e. 1 Mb, which equals about 6
seconds of audio data) or more; less than about 300 does not
make much sense. The default is 0, which turns buffering
off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;preload</b>
<i>fraction</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Wait for the buffer to be
filled to <i>fraction</i> before starting playback (fraction
between 0 and 1). You can tune this prebuffering to either
get faster sound to your ears or safer uninterrupted web
radio. Default is 0.2 (wait for 20 % of buffer to be full,
changed from 1 in version 1.23).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;devbuffer</b>
<i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set device buffer in seconds;
&lt;= 0 means default value. This is the small buffer
between the application and the audio backend, possibly
directly related to hardware buffers.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;smooth</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Keep buffer over track
boundaries -- meaning, do not empty the buffer between
tracks for possibly some added smoothness.</p>

<h2>HTTP SUPPORT
<a name="HTTP SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
reading MPEG audio streams from ordinary files and from the
standard input, <b>mpg123</b> supports retrieval of MPEG
audio streams or playlists via the HTTP protocol, which is
used in the World Wide Web (WWW). Such files are specified
using a so-called URL, which starts with http:// or
https://. When a file with that prefix is encountered,
<b>mpg123</b> since 1.30.0 will by default call an external
helper program (either <b>wget</b>(1) or <b>curl</b>(1), see
the <b>&minus;&minus;network</b> option) to retrieve the
resource. You can configure access via a proxy server using
the standard environment variables those programs support.
The <b>&minus;&minus;proxy</b> option that <b>mpg123</b>
before 1.30.0 used for its internal network code is gone in
the default build now and will probably disappear for good
with 1.31.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that, in
order to play MPEG audio files from a WWW server, it is
necessary that the connection to that server is fast enough.
For example, a 128 kbit/s MPEG file requires the network
connection to be at least 128 kbit/s (16 kbyte/s) plus
protocol overhead. If you suffer from short network outages,
you should try the <b>&minus;b</b> option (buffer) to bypass
such outages. If your network connection is generally not
fast enough to retrieve MPEG audio files in realtime, you
can first download the files to your local harddisk (e.g.
using <b>wget</b>(1)) and then play them from there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Streams with
embedded ICY metadata are supported, the interval being
communicated via HTTP headers or
<b>&minus;&minus;icy-interval</b>.</p>

<h2>INTERRUPT
<a name="INTERRUPT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When in
terminal control mode, you can quit via pressing the q key,
while any time you can abort <b>mpg123</b> by pressing
Ctrl-C. If not in terminal control mode, this will skip to
the next file (if any). If you want to abort playing
immediately in that case, press Ctrl-C twice in short
succession (within about one second).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
result of quitting <b>mpg123</b> pressing Ctrl-C might not
be audible immediately, due to audio data buffering in the
audio device. This delay is system dependent, but it is
usually not more than one or two seconds.</p>

<h2>PLAYBACK STATUS LINE
<a name="PLAYBACK STATUS LINE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In verbose
mode, mpg123 updates a line with various information
centering around the current playback position. On any
decent terminal, the line also works as a progress bar in
the current file by reversing video for a fraction of the
line according to the current position. An example for a
full line is this:</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">MPEG audio
decoding requires a good deal of CPU performance, especially
layer-3. To decode it in realtime, you should have at least
an i486DX4, Pentium, Alpha, SuperSparc or equivalent
processor. You can also use the <b>-m</b> option to decode
mono only, which reduces the CPU load somewhat for layer-3
streams. See also the <b>&minus;2</b> and <b>&minus;4</b>
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If everything
else fails, have mpg123 decode to a file and then use an
appropriate utility to play that file with less CPU load.
Most probably you can configure mpg123 to produce a format
suitable for your audio device (see above about encodings
and sampling rates).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your system
is generally fast enough to decode in realtime, but there
are sometimes periods of heavy system load (such as
cronjobs, users logging in remotely, starting of
&lsquo;&lsquo;big&rsquo;&rsquo; programs etc.) causing the
audio output to be interrupted, then you should use the
<b>&minus;b</b> option to use a buffer of reasonable size
(at least 1000 Kbytes).</p>

<h2>EXIT CODE
<a name="EXIT CODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Up to version
1.25.x, mpg123 always returned exit code 0 also for complete
junk on the input side. Fatal errors were only considered
for output. With version 1.26.0, this changed to the
behaviour described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When not using
the remote control interface (which returns input errors as
text messages), the process exit code is zero (success) only
if all tracks in a playlist had at least one frame parsed,
even if it did not decode cleanly, or are empty, MPEG-wise
(perhaps only metadata, or really an empty file). When you
decode nothing, nothing is the result and that is fine. When
a track later aborts because of parser errors or breakdown
of the network communication, this is treated as end of a
track, but does not make the process as such fail. One
really bad (or non-existing) stream in the playlist results
in a non-zero error code, consistent with other UNIX
tools.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An error in
audio output results in the process ending with a non-zero
exit code immediately, regardless of how much data has been
successfully played before. The forgiveness is only on the
input side.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mostly MPEG-1
layer 2 and 3 are tested in real life. Please report any
issues and provide test files to help fixing them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No CRC error
checking is performed. But the decoder is built and tested
to behave nicely with damaged streams. Mostly, damaged
frames will just be silent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some platforms
lack audio hardware support; you may be able to use the
<b>-s</b> switch to feed the decoded data to a program that
can play it on your audio device.</p>
