<h2>Q and A
<a name="Q and A"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is a list
of questions and answers about Unicode in Perl, intended to
be read after perlunitut.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>perlunitut
isn&rsquo;t really a Unicode tutorial, is it?</b> <br>
No, and this isn&rsquo;t really a Unicode
<small>FAQ.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl has an
abstracted interface for all supported character encodings,
so this is actually a generic &quot;Encode&quot; tutorial
and &quot;Encode&quot; <small>FAQ.</small> But many people
think that Unicode is special and magical, and I
didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint them, so I decided to call
the document a Unicode tutorial.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What
character encodings does Perl support?</b> <br>
To find out which character encodings your Perl supports,
run:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl
&minus;MEncode &minus;le &quot;print for
Encode&minus;&gt;encodings(':all')&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Which
version of perl should I use?</b> <br>
Well, if you can, upgrade to the most recent, but certainly
5.8.1 or newer. The tutorial and <small>FAQ</small> assume
the latest release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should also
check your modules, and upgrade them if necessary. For
example, HTML::Entities requires version &gt;= 1.32 to
function correctly, even though the changelog is silent
about this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What about
binary data, like images?</b> <br>
Well, apart from a bare &quot;binmode $fh&quot;, you
shouldn&rsquo;t treat them specially. (The binmode is needed
because otherwise Perl may convert line endings on Win32
systems.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be careful,
though, to never combine text strings with binary strings.
If you need text in a binary stream, encode your text
strings first using the appropriate encoding, then join them
with binary strings. See also: &quot;What if I don&rsquo;t
encode?&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>When should
I decode or encode?</b> <br>
Whenever you&rsquo;re communicating text with anything that
is external to your perl process, like a database, a text
file, a socket, or another program. Even if the thing
you&rsquo;re communicating with is also written in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What if I
don&rsquo;t decode?</b> <br>
Whenever your encoded, binary string is used together with a
text string, Perl will assume that your binary string was
encoded with <small>ISO&minus;8859&minus;1,</small> also
known as latin&minus;1. If it wasn&rsquo;t latin&minus;1,
then your data is unpleasantly converted. For example, if it
was <small>UTF&minus;8,</small> the individual bytes of
multibyte characters are seen as separate characters, and
then again converted to <small>UTF&minus;8.</small> Such
double encoding can be compared to double
<small>HTML</small> encoding (&quot;&amp;amp;gt;&quot;), or
double <small>URI</small> encoding (%253E).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This silent
implicit decoding is known as &quot;upgrading&quot;. That
may sound positive, but it&rsquo;s best to avoid it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What if I
don&rsquo;t encode?</b> <br>
It depends on what you output and how you output it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Output via a
filehandle</i></p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If the string&rsquo;s characters are all code point 255
or lower, Perl outputs bytes that match those code points.
This is what happens with encoded strings. It can also,
though, happen with unencoded strings that happen to be all
code point 255 or lower.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Otherwise, Perl outputs the string encoded as
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small> This only happens with strings
you neglected to encode. Since that should not happen, Perl
also throws a &quot;wide character&quot; warning in this
case.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Other output
mechanisms (e.g., &quot;exec&quot;, &quot;chdir&quot;,
..)</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Your text
string will be sent using the bytes in Perl&rsquo;s internal
format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
internal format is often <small>UTF&minus;8,</small> these
bugs are hard to spot, because <small>UTF&minus;8</small> is
usually the encoding you wanted! But don&rsquo;t be lazy,
and don&rsquo;t use the fact that Perl&rsquo;s internal
format is <small>UTF&minus;8</small> to your advantage.
Encode explicitly to avoid weird bugs, and to show to
maintenance programmers that you thought this through.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Is there a
way to automatically decode or encode?</b> <br>
If all data that comes from a certain handle is encoded in
exactly the same way, you can tell the PerlIO system to
automatically decode everything, with the
&quot;encoding&quot; layer. If you do this, you can&rsquo;t
accidentally forget to decode or encode anymore, on things
that use the layered handle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can provide
this layer when &quot;open&quot;ing the file:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open my $fh,
'&gt;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)', $filename; # auto encoding on
write <br>
open my $fh, '&lt;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)', $filename; # auto
decoding on read</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or if you
already have an open filehandle:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">binmode $fh,
':encoding(UTF&minus;8)';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some database
drivers for <small>DBI</small> can also automatically encode
and decode, but that is sometimes limited to the
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What if I
don&rsquo;t know which encoding was used?</b> <br>
Do whatever you can to find out, and if you have to: guess.
(Don&rsquo;t forget to document your guess with a
comment.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You could open
the document in a web browser, and change the character set
or character encoding until you can visually confirm that
all characters look the way they should.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no way
to reliably detect the encoding automatically, so if people
keep sending you data without charset indication, you may
have to educate them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Can I use
Unicode in my Perl sources?</b> <br>
Yes, you can! If your sources are <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
encoded, you can indicate that with the &quot;use utf8&quot;
pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use utf8;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
doesn&rsquo;t do anything to your input, or to your output.
It only influences the way your sources are read. You can
use Unicode in string literals, in identifiers (but they
still have to be &quot;word characters&quot; according to
&quot;\w&quot;), and even in custom delimiters.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Data::Dumper
doesn&rsquo;t restore the <small>UTF8</small> flag; is it
broken?</b> <br>
No, Data::Dumper&rsquo;s Unicode abilities are as they
should be. There have been some complaints that it should
restore the <small>UTF8</small> flag when the data is read
again with &quot;eval&quot;. However, you should really not
look at the flag, and nothing indicates that Data::Dumper
should break this rule.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
what happens: when Perl reads in a string literal, it sticks
to 8 bit encoding as long as it can. (But perhaps originally
it was internally encoded as <small>UTF&minus;8,</small>
when you dumped it.) When it has to give that up because
other characters are added to the text string, it silently
upgrades the string to <small>UTF&minus;8.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you properly
encode your strings for output, none of this is of your
concern, and you can just &quot;eval&quot; dumped data as
always.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why do regex
character classes sometimes match only in the
<small>ASCII</small> range?</b> <br>
Starting in Perl 5.14 (and partially in Perl 5.12), just put
a &quot;use feature 'unicode_strings'&quot; near the
beginning of your program. Within its lexical scope you
shouldn&rsquo;t have this problem. It also is automatically
enabled under &quot;use feature ':5.12'&quot; or &quot;use
v5.12&quot; or using &quot;&minus;E&quot; on the command
line for Perl 5.12 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The rationale
for requiring this is to not break older programs that rely
on the way things worked before Unicode came along. Those
older programs knew only about the <small>ASCII</small>
character set, and so may not work properly for additional
characters. When a string is encoded in
<small>UTF&minus;8,</small> Perl assumes that the program is
prepared to deal with Unicode, but when the string
isn&rsquo;t, Perl assumes that only <small>ASCII</small> is
wanted, and so those characters that are not
<small>ASCII</small> characters aren&rsquo;t recognized as
to what they would be in Unicode. &quot;use feature
'unicode_strings'&quot; tells Perl to treat all characters
as Unicode, whether the string is encoded in
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> or not, thus avoiding the
problem.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, on
earlier Perls, or if you pass strings to subroutines outside
the feature&rsquo;s scope, you can force Unicode rules by
changing the encoding to <small>UTF&minus;8</small> by doing
&quot;utf8::upgrade($string)&quot;. This can be used safely
on any string, as it checks and does not change strings that
have already been upgraded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a more
detailed discussion, see Unicode::Semantics on
<small>CPAN.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why do some
characters not uppercase or lowercase correctly?</b> <br>
See the answer to the previous question.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How can I
determine if a string is a text string or a binary
string?</b> <br>
You can&rsquo;t. Some use the <small>UTF8</small> flag for
this, but that&rsquo;s misuse, and makes well behaved
modules like Data::Dumper look bad. The flag is useless for
this purpose, because it&rsquo;s off when an 8 bit encoding
(by default <small>ISO&minus;8859&minus;1</small> ) is used
to store the string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
something you, the programmer, has to keep track of; sorry.
You could consider adopting a kind of &quot;Hungarian
notation&quot; to help with this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
convert from encoding <small>FOO</small> to encoding
<small>BAR</small> ?</b> <br>
By first converting the FOO-encoded byte string to a text
string, and then the text string to a BAR-encoded byte
string:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $text_string
= decode('FOO', $foo_string); <br>
my $bar_string = encode('BAR', $text_string);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or by skipping
the text string part, and going directly from one binary
encoding to the other:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use Encode
qw(from_to); <br>
from_to($string, 'FOO', 'BAR'); # changes contents of
$string</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or by letting
automatic decoding and encoding do all the work:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open my $foofh,
'&lt;:encoding(FOO)', 'example.foo.txt'; <br>
open my $barfh, '&gt;:encoding(BAR)', 'example.bar.txt';
<br>
print { $barfh } $_ while &lt;$foofh&gt;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What are
&quot;decode_utf8&quot; and &quot;encode_utf8&quot;?</b>
<br>
These are alternate syntaxes for &quot;decode('utf8',
...)&quot; and &quot;encode('utf8', ...)&quot;. Do not use
these functions for data exchange. Instead use
&quot;decode('UTF&minus;8', ...)&quot; and
&quot;encode('UTF&minus;8', ...)&quot;; see
&quot;What&rsquo;s the difference between
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> and utf8?&quot; below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is a
&quot;wide character&quot;?</b> <br>
This is a term used for characters occupying more than one
byte.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
warning &quot;Wide character in ...&quot; is caused by such
a character. With no specified encoding layer, Perl tries to
fit things into a single byte. When it can&rsquo;t, it emits
this warning (if warnings are enabled), and uses
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded data instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid this
warning and to avoid having different output encodings in a
single stream, always specify an encoding explicitly, for
example with a PerlIO layer:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">binmode STDOUT,
&quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)&quot;;</p>

<h2>INTERNALS
<a name="INTERNALS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is
&quot;the <small>UTF8</small> flag&quot;?</b> <br>
Please, unless you&rsquo;re hacking the internals, or
debugging weirdness, don&rsquo;t think about the
<small>UTF8</small> flag at all. That means that you very
probably shouldn&rsquo;t use &quot;is_utf8&quot;,
&quot;_utf8_on&quot; or &quot;_utf8_off&quot; at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>UTF8</small> flag, also called SvUTF8, is an internal
flag that indicates that the current internal representation
is <small>UTF&minus;8.</small> Without the flag, it is
assumed to be <small>ISO&minus;8859&minus;1.</small> Perl
converts between these automatically. (Actually Perl usually
assumes the representation is <small>ASCII</small> ; see
&quot;Why do regex character classes sometimes match only in
the <small>ASCII</small> range?&quot; above.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of
Perl&rsquo;s internal formats happens to be
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small> Unfortunately, Perl can&rsquo;t
keep a secret, so everyone knows about this. That is the
source of much confusion. It&rsquo;s better to pretend that
the internal format is some unknown encoding, and that you
always have to encode and decode explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What about
the &quot;use bytes&quot; pragma?</b> <br>
Don&rsquo;t use it. It makes no sense to deal with bytes in
a text string, and it makes no sense to deal with characters
in a byte string. Do the proper conversions (by
decoding/encoding), and things will work out well: you get
character counts for decoded data, and byte counts for
encoded data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;use
bytes&quot; is usually a failed attempt to do something
useful. Just forget about it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What about
the &quot;use encoding&quot; pragma?</b> <br>
Don&rsquo;t use it. Unfortunately, it assumes that the
programmer&rsquo;s environment and that of the user will use
the same encoding. It will use the same encoding for the
source code and for <small>STDIN</small> and
<small>STDOUT.</small> When a program is copied to another
machine, the source code does not change, but the
<small>STDIO</small> environment might.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you need
non-ASCII characters in your source code, make it a
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded file and &quot;use
utf8&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you need to
set the encoding for <small>STDIN, STDOUT,</small> and
<small>STDERR,</small> for example based on the user&rsquo;s
locale, &quot;use open&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What is the
difference between &quot;:encoding&quot; and
&quot;:utf8&quot;?</b> <br>
Because <small>UTF&minus;8</small> is one of Perl&rsquo;s
internal formats, you can often just skip the encoding or
decoding step, and manipulate the <small>UTF8</small> flag
directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of
&quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)&quot;, you can simply use
&quot;:utf8&quot;, which skips the encoding step if the data
was already represented as <small>UTF8</small> internally.
This is widely accepted as good behavior when you&rsquo;re
writing, but it can be dangerous when reading, because it
causes internal inconsistency when you have invalid byte
sequences. Using &quot;:utf8&quot; for input can sometimes
result in security breaches, so please use
&quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of
&quot;decode&quot; and &quot;encode&quot;, you could use
&quot;_utf8_on&quot; and &quot;_utf8_off&quot;, but this is
considered bad style. Especially &quot;_utf8_on&quot; can be
dangerous, for the same reason that &quot;:utf8&quot;
can.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are some
shortcuts for oneliners; see &minus;C in perlrun.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>What&rsquo;s
the difference between &quot;UTF&minus;8&quot; and
&quot;utf8&quot;?</b> <br>
&quot;UTF&minus;8&quot; is the official standard.
&quot;utf8&quot; is Perl&rsquo;s way of being liberal in
what it accepts. If you have to communicate with things that
aren&rsquo;t so liberal, you may want to consider using
&quot;UTF&minus;8&quot;. If you have to communicate with
things that are too liberal, you may have to use
&quot;utf8&quot;. The full explanation is in &quot;
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> vs. utf8 vs.
<small>UTF8&quot;</small> in Encode.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;UTF&minus;8&quot;
is internally known as &quot;utf&minus;8&minus;strict&quot;.
The tutorial uses <small>UTF&minus;8</small> consistently,
even where utf8 is actually used internally, because the
distinction can be hard to make, and is mostly
irrelevant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
utf8 can be used for code points that don&rsquo;t exist in
Unicode, like 9999999, but if you encode that to
<small>UTF&minus;8,</small> you get a substitution character
(by default; see &quot;Handling Malformed Data&quot; in
Encode for more ways of dealing with this.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Okay, if you
insist: the &quot;internal format&quot; is utf8, not
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small> (When it&rsquo;s not some other
encoding.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I lost
track; what encoding is the internal format really?</b> <br>
It&rsquo;s good that you lost track, because you
shouldn&rsquo;t depend on the internal format being any
specific encoding. But since you asked: by default, the
internal format is either
<small>ISO&minus;8859&minus;1</small> (latin&minus;1), or
utf8, depending on the history of the string. On
<small>EBCDIC</small> platforms, this may be different
even.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl knows how
it stored the string internally, and will use that knowledge
when you &quot;encode&quot;. In other words: don&rsquo;t try
to find out what the internal encoding for a certain string
is, but instead just encode it into the encoding that you
want.</p>
