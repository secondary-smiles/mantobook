&minus; tutorial on &quot;pack&quot; and
&quot;unpack&quot;</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;pack&quot;
and &quot;unpack&quot; are two functions for transforming
data according to a user-defined template, between the
guarded way Perl stores values and some well-defined
representation as might be required in the environment of a
Perl program. Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re also two of the
most misunderstood and most often overlooked functions that
Perl provides. This tutorial will demystify them for
you.</p>

<h2>The Basic Principle
<a name="The Basic Principle"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most
programming languages don&rsquo;t shelter the memory where
variables are stored. In C, for instance, you can take the
address of some variable, and the &quot;sizeof&quot;
operator tells you how many bytes are allocated to the
variable. Using the address and the size, you may access the
storage to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl, you
just can&rsquo;t access memory at random, but the structural
and representational conversion provided by &quot;pack&quot;
and &quot;unpack&quot; is an excellent alternative. The
&quot;pack&quot; function converts values to a byte sequence
containing representations according to a given
specification, the so-called &quot;template&quot; argument.
&quot;unpack&quot; is the reverse process, deriving some
values from the contents of a string of bytes. (Be
cautioned, however, that not all that has been packed
together can be neatly unpacked &minus; a very common
experience as seasoned travellers are likely to
confirm.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Why, you may
ask, would you need a chunk of memory containing some values
in binary representation? One good reason is input and
output accessing some file, a device, or a network
connection, whereby this binary representation is either
forced on you or will give you some benefit in processing.
Another cause is passing data to some system call that is
not available as a Perl function: &quot;syscall&quot;
requires you to provide parameters stored in the way it
happens in a C program. Even text processing (as shown in
the next section) may be simplified with judicious usage of
these two functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To see how
(un)packing works, we&rsquo;ll start with a simple template
code where the conversion is in low gear: between the
contents of a byte sequence and a string of hexadecimal
digits. Let&rsquo;s use &quot;unpack&quot;, since this is
likely to remind you of a dump program, or some desperate
last message unfortunate programs are wont to throw at you
before they expire into the wild blue yonder. Assuming that
the variable $mem holds a sequence of bytes that we&rsquo;d
like to inspect without assuming anything about its meaning,
we can write</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my( $hex ) =
unpack( 'H*', $mem ); <br>
print &quot;$hex\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">whereupon we
might see something like this, with each pair of hex digits
corresponding to a byte:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">41204d414e204120504c414e20412043414e414c2050414e414d41</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What was in
this chunk of memory? Numbers, characters, or a mixture of
both? Assuming that we&rsquo;re on a computer where
<small>ASCII</small> (or some similar) encoding is used:
hexadecimal values in the range 0x40 &minus; 0x5A indicate
an uppercase letter, and 0x20 encodes a space. So we might
assume it is a piece of text, which some are able to read
like a tabloid; but others will have to get hold of an
<small>ASCII</small> table and relive that firstgrader
feeling. Not caring too much about which way to read this,
we note that &quot;unpack&quot; with the template code
&quot;H&quot; converts the contents of a sequence of bytes
into the customary hexadecimal notation. Since &quot;a
sequence of&quot; is a pretty vague indication of quantity,
&quot;H&quot; has been defined to convert just a single
hexadecimal digit unless it is followed by a repeat count.
An asterisk for the repeat count means to use whatever
remains.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The inverse
operation &minus; packing byte contents from a string of
hexadecimal digits &minus; is just as easily written. For
instance:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $s = pack(
'H2' x 10, 30..39 ); <br>
print &quot;$s\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since we feed a
list of ten 2&minus;digit hexadecimal strings to
&quot;pack&quot;, the pack template should contain ten pack
codes. If this is run on a computer with
<small>ASCII</small> character coding, it will print
0123456789.</p>

<h2>Packing Text
<a name="Packing Text"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s
suppose you&rsquo;ve got to read in a data file like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Date
|Description | Income|Expenditure <br>
01/24/2001 Zed's Camel Emporium 1147.99 <br>
01/28/2001 Flea spray 24.99 <br>
01/29/2001 Camel rides to tourists 235.00</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How do we do
it? You might think first to use &quot;split&quot;; however,
since &quot;split&quot; collapses blank fields, you&rsquo;ll
never know whether a record was income or expenditure. Oops.
Well, you could always use &quot;substr&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">while
(&lt;&gt;) { <br>
my $date = substr($_, 0, 11); <br>
my $desc = substr($_, 12, 27); <br>
my $income = substr($_, 40, 7); <br>
my $expend = substr($_, 52, 7); <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s not
really a barrel of laughs, is it? In fact, it&rsquo;s worse
than it may seem; the eagle-eyed may notice that the first
field should only be 10 characters wide, and the error has
propagated right through the other numbers &minus; which
we&rsquo;ve had to count by hand. So it&rsquo;s error-prone
as well as horribly unfriendly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or maybe we
could use regular expressions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">while
(&lt;&gt;) { <br>
my($date, $desc, $income, $expend) = <br>
m|(\d\d/\d\d/\d{4}) (.{27}) (.{7})(.*)|; <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Urgh. Well,
it&rsquo;s a bit better, but &minus; well, would you want to
maintain that?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hey,
isn&rsquo;t Perl supposed to make this sort of thing easy?
Well, it does, if you use the right tools. &quot;pack&quot;
and &quot;unpack&quot; are designed to help you out when
dealing with fixed-width data like the above. Let&rsquo;s
have a look at a solution with &quot;unpack&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">while
(&lt;&gt;) { <br>
my($date, $desc, $income, $expend) =
unpack(&quot;A10xA27xA7A*&quot;, $_); <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That looks a
bit nicer; but we&rsquo;ve got to take apart that weird
template. Where did I pull that out of?</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>OK,</small>
let&rsquo;s have a look at some of our data again; in fact,
we&rsquo;ll include the headers, and a handy ruler so we can
keep track of where we are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1 2 3 4 5 <br>
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678
<br>
Date |Description | Income|Expenditure <br>
01/28/2001 Flea spray 24.99 <br>
01/29/2001 Camel rides to tourists 235.00</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From this, we
can see that the date column stretches from column 1 to
column 10 &minus; ten characters wide. The
&quot;pack&quot;&minus;ese for &quot;character&quot; is
&quot;A&quot;, and ten of them are &quot;A10&quot;. So if we
just wanted to extract the dates, we could say this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my($date) =
unpack(&quot;A10&quot;, $_);</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>OK,</small>
what&rsquo;s next? Between the date and the description is a
blank column; we want to skip over that. The &quot;x&quot;
template means &quot;skip forward&quot;, so we want one of
those. Next, we have another batch of characters, from 12 to
38. That&rsquo;s 27 more characters, hence &quot;A27&quot;.
(Don&rsquo;t make the fencepost error &minus; there are 27
characters between 12 and 38, not 26. Count &rsquo;em!)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now we skip
another character and pick up the next 7 characters:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my($date,$description,$income)
= unpack(&quot;A10xA27xA7&quot;, $_);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now comes the
clever bit. Lines in our ledger which are just income and
not expenditure might end at column 46. Hence, we
don&rsquo;t want to tell our &quot;unpack&quot; pattern that
we <b>need</b> to find another 12 characters; we&rsquo;ll
just say &quot;if there&rsquo;s anything left, take
it&quot;. As you might guess from regular expressions,
that&rsquo;s what the &quot;*&quot; means: &quot;use
everything remaining&quot;.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Be warned, though, that unlike regular expressions, if
the &quot;unpack&quot; template doesn&rsquo;t match the
incoming data, Perl will scream and die.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hence, putting
it all together:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my ($date,
$description, $income, $expend) = <br>
unpack(&quot;A10xA27xA7xA*&quot;, $_);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now,
that&rsquo;s our data parsed. I suppose what we might want
to do now is total up our income and expenditure, and add
another line to the end of our ledger &minus; in the same
format &minus; saying how much we&rsquo;ve brought in and
how much we&rsquo;ve spent:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">while
(&lt;&gt;) { <br>
my ($date, $desc, $income, $expend) = <br>
unpack(&quot;A10xA27xA7xA*&quot;, $_); <br>
$tot_income += $income; <br>
$tot_expend += $expend; <br>
} <br>
$tot_income = sprintf(&quot;%.2f&quot;, $tot_income); # Get
them into <br>
$tot_expend = sprintf(&quot;%.2f&quot;, $tot_expend); #
&quot;financial&quot; format <br>
$date = POSIX::strftime(&quot;%m/%d/%Y&quot;, localtime);
<br>
# OK, let's go: <br>
print pack(&quot;A10xA27xA7xA*&quot;, $date,
&quot;Totals&quot;, <br>
$tot_income, $tot_expend);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Oh, hmm. That
didn&rsquo;t quite work. Let&rsquo;s see what happened:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">01/24/2001
Zed's Camel Emporium 1147.99 <br>
01/28/2001 Flea spray 24.99 <br>
01/29/2001 Camel rides to tourists 1235.00 <br>
03/23/2001Totals 1235.001172.98</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>OK,</small>
it&rsquo;s a start, but what happened to the spaces? We put
&quot;x&quot;, didn&rsquo;t we? Shouldn&rsquo;t it skip
forward? Let&rsquo;s look at what &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc says:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">x A null
byte.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Urgh. No
wonder. There&rsquo;s a big difference between &quot;a null
byte&quot;, character zero, and &quot;a space&quot;,
character 32. Perl&rsquo;s put something between the date
and the description &minus; but unfortunately, we
can&rsquo;t see it!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What we
actually need to do is expand the width of the fields. The
&quot;A&quot; format pads any non-existent characters with
spaces, so we can use the additional spaces to line up our
fields, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print
pack(&quot;A11 A28 A8 A*&quot;, $date, &quot;Totals&quot;,
<br>
$tot_income, $tot_expend);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Note that you
can put spaces in the template to make it more readable, but
they don&rsquo;t translate to spaces in the output.)
Here&rsquo;s what we got this time:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">01/24/2001
Zed's Camel Emporium 1147.99 <br>
01/28/2001 Flea spray 24.99 <br>
01/29/2001 Camel rides to tourists 1235.00 <br>
03/23/2001 Totals 1235.00 1172.98</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s a
bit better, but we still have that last column which needs
to be moved further over. There&rsquo;s an easy way to fix
this up: unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t get &quot;pack&quot;
to right-justify our fields, but we can get
&quot;sprintf&quot; to do it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$tot_income =
sprintf(&quot;%.2f&quot;, $tot_income); <br>
$tot_expend = sprintf(&quot;%12.2f&quot;, $tot_expend); <br>
$date = POSIX::strftime(&quot;%m/%d/%Y&quot;, localtime);
<br>
print pack(&quot;A11 A28 A8 A*&quot;, $date,
&quot;Totals&quot;, <br>
$tot_income, $tot_expend);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This time we
get the right answer:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">01/28/2001 Flea
spray 24.99 <br>
01/29/2001 Camel rides to tourists 1235.00 <br>
03/23/2001 Totals 1235.00 1172.98</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So that&rsquo;s
how we consume and produce fixed-width data. Let&rsquo;s
recap what we&rsquo;ve seen of &quot;pack&quot; and
&quot;unpack&quot; so far:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Use &quot;pack&quot; to go from
several pieces of data to one fixed-width version; use
&quot;unpack&quot; to turn a fixed-width-format string into
several pieces of data.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>The pack format &quot;A&quot; means &quot;any
character&quot;; if you&rsquo;re &quot;pack&quot;ing and
you&rsquo;ve run out of things to pack, &quot;pack&quot;
will fill the rest up with spaces.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>&quot;x&quot; means &quot;skip a byte&quot; when
&quot;unpack&quot;ing; when &quot;pack&quot;ing, it means
&quot;introduce a null byte&quot; &minus; that&rsquo;s
probably not what you mean if you&rsquo;re dealing with
plain text.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>You can follow the formats with numbers to say how many
characters should be affected by that format:
&quot;A12&quot; means &quot;take 12 characters&quot;;
&quot;x6&quot; means &quot;skip 6 bytes&quot; or
&quot;character 0, 6 times&quot;.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Instead of a number, you can use &quot;*&quot; to mean
&quot;consume everything else left&quot;.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning</b>:
when packing multiple pieces of data, &quot;*&quot; only
means &quot;consume all of the current piece of data&quot;.
That&rsquo;s to say</p>


<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">pack(&quot;A*A*&quot;,
$one, $two)</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">packs all of
$one into the first &quot;A*&quot; and then all of $two into
the second. This is a general principle: each format
character corresponds to one piece of data to be
&quot;pack&quot;ed.</p>

<h2>Packing Numbers
<a name="Packing Numbers"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So much for
textual data. Let&rsquo;s get onto the meaty stuff that
&quot;pack&quot; and &quot;unpack&quot; are best at:
handling binary formats for numbers. There is, of course,
not just one binary format &minus; life would be too simple
&minus; but Perl will do all the finicky labor for you.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Integers</b>
<br>
Packing and unpacking numbers implies conversion to and from
some <i>specific</i> binary representation. Leaving floating
point numbers aside for the moment, the salient properties
of any such representation are:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">the number of bytes used for
storing the integer,</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>whether the contents are interpreted as a signed or
unsigned number,</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>the byte ordering: whether the first byte is the least
or most significant byte (or: little-endian or big-endian,
respectively).</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So, for
instance, to pack 20302 to a signed 16 bit integer in your
computer&rsquo;s representation you write</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $ps = pack(
's', 20302 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Again, the
result is a string, now containing 2 bytes. If you print
this string (which is, generally, not recommended) you might
see &quot;ON&quot; or &quot;NO&quot; (depending on your
system&rsquo;s byte ordering) &minus; or something entirely
different if your computer doesn&rsquo;t use
<small>ASCII</small> character encoding. Unpacking $ps with
the same template returns the original integer value:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my( $s ) =
unpack( 's', $ps );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is true
for all numeric template codes. But don&rsquo;t expect
miracles: if the packed value exceeds the allotted byte
capacity, high order bits are silently discarded, and unpack
certainly won&rsquo;t be able to pull them back out of some
magic hat. And, when you pack using a signed template code
such as &quot;s&quot;, an excess value may result in the
sign bit getting set, and unpacking this will smartly return
a negative value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">16 bits
won&rsquo;t get you too far with integers, but there is
&quot;l&quot; and &quot;L&quot; for signed and unsigned
32&minus;bit integers. And if this is not enough and your
system supports 64 bit integers you can push the limits much
closer to infinity with pack codes &quot;q&quot; and
&quot;Q&quot;. A notable exception is provided by pack codes
&quot;i&quot; and &quot;I&quot; for signed and unsigned
integers of the &quot;local custom&quot; variety: Such an
integer will take up as many bytes as a local C compiler
returns for &quot;sizeof(int)&quot;, but it&rsquo;ll use
<i>at least</i> 32 bits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each of the
integer pack codes &quot;sSlLqQ&quot; results in a fixed
number of bytes, no matter where you execute your program.
This may be useful for some applications, but it does not
provide for a portable way to pass data structures between
Perl and C programs (bound to happen when you call
<small>XS</small> extensions or the Perl function
&quot;syscall&quot;), or when you read or write binary
files. What you&rsquo;ll need in this case are template
codes that depend on what your local C compiler compiles
when you code &quot;short&quot; or &quot;unsigned
long&quot;, for instance. These codes and their
corresponding byte lengths are shown in the table below.
Since the C standard leaves much leeway with respect to the
relative sizes of these data types, actual values may vary,
and that&rsquo;s why the values are given as expressions in
C and Perl. (If you&rsquo;d like to use values from %Config
in your program you have to import it with &quot;use
Config&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">signed unsigned
byte length in C byte length in Perl <br>
s! S! sizeof(short) $Config{shortsize} <br>
i! I! sizeof(int) $Config{intsize} <br>
l! L! sizeof(long) $Config{longsize} <br>
q! Q! sizeof(long long) $Config{longlongsize}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;i!&quot; and &quot;I!&quot; codes aren&rsquo;t
different from &quot;i&quot; and &quot;I&quot;; they are
tolerated for completeness&rsquo; sake.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unpacking a
Stack Frame</b> <br>
Requesting a particular byte ordering may be necessary when
you work with binary data coming from some specific
architecture whereas your program could run on a totally
different system. As an example, assume you have 24 bytes
containing a stack frame as it happens on an Intel 8086:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, we note
that this time-honored 16&minus;bit <small>CPU</small> uses
little-endian order, and that&rsquo;s why the low order byte
is stored at the lower address. To unpack such a (unsigned)
short we&rsquo;ll have to use code &quot;v&quot;. A repeat
count unpacks all 12 shorts:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my( $ip, $cs,
$flags, $ax, $bx, $cx, $dx, $si, $di, $bp, $ds, $es ) = <br>
unpack( 'v12', $frame );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
we could have used &quot;C&quot; to unpack the individually
accessible byte registers <small>FL, FH, AL, AH,</small>
etc.:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my( $fl, $fh,
$al, $ah, $bl, $bh, $cl, $ch, $dl, $dh ) = <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It would be
nice if we could do this in one fell swoop: unpack a short,
back up a little, and then unpack 2 bytes. Since Perl
<i>is</i> nice, it proffers the template code &quot;X&quot;
to back up one byte. Putting this all together, we may now
write:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my( $ip, $cs,
<br>

$ax,$al,$ah, $bx,$bl,$bh, $cx,$cl,$ch, $dx,$dl,$dh, <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(The clumsy
construction of the template can be avoided &minus; just
read on!)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ve
taken some pains to construct the template so that it
matches the contents of our frame buffer. Otherwise
we&rsquo;d either get undefined values, or
&quot;unpack&quot; could not unpack all. If &quot;pack&quot;
runs out of items, it will supply null strings (which are
coerced into zeroes whenever the pack code says so).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How to Eat
an Egg on a Net</b> <br>
The pack code for big-endian (high order byte at the lowest
address) is &quot;n&quot; for 16 bit and &quot;N&quot; for
32 bit integers. You use these codes if you know that your
data comes from a compliant architecture, but, surprisingly
enough, you should also use these pack codes if you exchange
binary data, across the network, with some system that you
know next to nothing about. The simple reason is that this
order has been chosen as the <i>network order</i>, and all
standard-fearing programs ought to follow this convention.
(This is, of course, a stern backing for one of the
Lilliputian parties and may well influence the political
development there.) So, if the protocol expects you to send
a message by sending the length first, followed by just so
many bytes, you could write:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $buf = pack(
'N', length( $msg ) ) . $msg;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or even:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $buf = pack(
'NA*', length( $msg ), $msg );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and pass $buf
to your send routine. Some protocols demand that the count
should include the length of the count itself: then just add
4 to the data length. (But make sure to read &quot;Lengths
and Widths&quot; before you really code this!)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Byte-order
modifiers</b> <br>
In the previous sections we&rsquo;ve learned how to use
&quot;n&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;v&quot; and
&quot;V&quot; to pack and unpack integers with big&minus; or
little-endian byte-order. While this is nice, it&rsquo;s
still rather limited because it leaves out all kinds of
signed integers as well as 64&minus;bit integers. For
example, if you wanted to unpack a sequence of signed
big-endian 16&minus;bit integers in a platform-independent
way, you would have to write:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my @data =
unpack 's*', pack 'S*', unpack 'n*', $buf;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is ugly.
As of Perl 5.9.2, there&rsquo;s a much nicer way to express
your desire for a certain byte-order: the &quot;&gt;&quot;
and &quot;&lt;&quot; modifiers. &quot;&gt;&quot; is the
big-endian modifier, while &quot;&lt;&quot; is the
little-endian modifier. Using them, we could rewrite the
above code as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my @data =
unpack 's&gt;*', $buf;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see,
the &quot;big end&quot; of the arrow touches the
&quot;s&quot;, which is a nice way to remember that
&quot;&gt;&quot; is the big-endian modifier. The same
obviously works for &quot;&lt;&quot;, where the &quot;little
end&quot; touches the code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You will
probably find these modifiers even more useful if you have
to deal with big&minus; or little-endian C structures. Be
sure to read &quot;Packing and Unpacking C Structures&quot;
for more on that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Floating
point Numbers</b> <br>
For packing floating point numbers you have the choice
between the pack codes &quot;f&quot;, &quot;d&quot;,
&quot;F&quot; and &quot;D&quot;. &quot;f&quot; and
&quot;d&quot; pack into (or unpack from) single-precision or
double-precision representation as it is provided by your
system. If your systems supports it, &quot;D&quot; can be
used to pack and unpack (&quot;long double&quot;) values,
which can offer even more resolution than &quot;f&quot; or
&quot;d&quot;. <b>Note that there are different long double
formats.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;F&quot;
packs an &quot;NV&quot;, which is the floating point type
used by Perl internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
such thing as a network representation for reals, so if you
want to send your real numbers across computer boundaries,
you&rsquo;d better stick to text representation, possibly
using the hexadecimal float format (avoiding the decimal
conversion loss), unless you&rsquo;re absolutely sure
what&rsquo;s on the other end of the line. For the even more
adventuresome, you can use the byte-order modifiers from the
previous section also on floating point codes.</p>

<h2>Exotic Templates

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Bit
Strings</b> <br>
Bits are the atoms in the memory world. Access to individual
bits may have to be used either as a last resort or because
it is the most convenient way to handle your data. Bit
string (un)packing converts between strings containing a
series of 0 and 1 characters and a sequence of bytes each
containing a group of 8 bits. This is almost as simple as it
sounds, except that there are two ways the contents of a
byte may be written as a bit string. Let&rsquo;s have a look
at an annotated byte:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
<br>

+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>
| 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 | <br>

+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>
MSB LSB</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
egg-eating all over again: Some think that as a bit string
this should be written &quot;10001100&quot; i.e. beginning
with the most significant bit, others insist on
&quot;00110001&quot;. Well, Perl isn&rsquo;t biased, so
that&rsquo;s why we have two bit string codes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$byte = pack(
'B8', '10001100' ); # start with MSB <br>
$byte = pack( 'b8', '00110001' ); # start with LSB</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
possible to pack or unpack bit fields &minus; just integral
bytes. &quot;pack&quot; always starts at the next byte
boundary and &quot;rounds up&quot; to the next multiple of 8
by adding zero bits as required. (If you do want bit fields,
there is &quot;vec&quot; in perlfunc. Or you could implement
bit field handling at the character string level, using
split, substr, and concatenation on unpacked bit
strings.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To illustrate
unpacking for bit strings, we&rsquo;ll decompose a simple
status register (a &quot;&minus;&quot; stands for a
&quot;reserved&quot; bit):</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+

<br>
MSB LSB MSB LSB</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Converting
these two bytes to a string can be done with the unpack
template 'b16'. To obtain the individual bit values from the
bit string we use &quot;split&quot; with the
&quot;empty&quot; separator pattern which dissects into
individual characters. Bit values from the
&quot;reserved&quot; positions are simply assigned to
&quot;undef&quot;, a convenient notation for &quot;I
don&rsquo;t care where this goes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">($carry, undef,
$parity, undef, $auxcarry, undef, $zero, $sign, <br>
$trace, $interrupt, $direction, $overflow) = <br>
split( //, unpack( 'b16', $status ) );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We could have
used an unpack template 'b12' just as well, since the last 4
bits can be ignored anyway.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Uuencoding</b>
<br>
Another odd-man-out in the template alphabet is
&quot;u&quot;, which packs a &quot;uuencoded string&quot;.
(&quot;uu&quot; is short for Unix-to-Unix.) Chances are that
you won&rsquo;t ever need this encoding technique which was
invented to overcome the shortcomings of old-fashioned
transmission mediums that do not support other than simple
<small>ASCII</small> data. The essential recipe is simple:
Take three bytes, or 24 bits. Split them into 4 six-packs,
adding a space (0x20) to each. Repeat until all of the data
is blended. Fold groups of 4 bytes into lines no longer than
60 and garnish them in front with the original byte count
(incremented by 0x20) and a &quot;\n&quot; at the end.
&minus; The &quot;pack&quot; chef will prepare this for you,
a la minute, when you select pack code &quot;u&quot; on the
menu:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $uubuf =
pack( 'u', $bindat );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A repeat count
after &quot;u&quot; sets the number of bytes to put into an
uuencoded line, which is the maximum of 45 by default, but
could be set to some (smaller) integer multiple of three.
&quot;unpack&quot; simply ignores the repeat count.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Doing
Sums</b> <br>
An even stranger template code is
&quot;%&quot;&lt;<i>number</i>&gt;. First, because
it&rsquo;s used as a prefix to some other template code.
Second, because it cannot be used in &quot;pack&quot; at
all, and third, in &quot;unpack&quot;, doesn&rsquo;t return
the data as defined by the template code it precedes.
Instead it&rsquo;ll give you an integer of <i>number</i>
bits that is computed from the data value by doing sums. For
numeric unpack codes, no big feat is achieved:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $buf = pack(
'iii', 100, 20, 3 ); <br>
print unpack( '%32i3', $buf ), &quot;\n&quot;; # prints
123</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For string
values, &quot;%&quot; returns the sum of the byte values
saving you the trouble of a sum loop with &quot;substr&quot;
and &quot;ord&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print unpack(
'%32A*', &quot;\x01\x10&quot; ), &quot;\n&quot;; # prints
17</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although the
&quot;%&quot; code is documented as returning a
&quot;checksum&quot;: don&rsquo;t put your trust in such
values! Even when applied to a small number of bytes, they
won&rsquo;t guarantee a noticeable Hamming distance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In connection
with &quot;b&quot; or &quot;B&quot;, &quot;%&quot; simply
adds bits, and this can be put to good use to count set bits
efficiently:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $bitcount =
unpack( '%32b*', $mask );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And an even
parity bit can be determined like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $evenparity
= unpack( '%1b*', $mask );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unicode</b>
<br>
Unicode is a character set that can represent most
characters in most of the world&rsquo;s languages, providing
room for over one million different characters. Unicode 3.1
specifies 94,140 characters: The Basic Latin characters are
assigned to the numbers 0 &minus; 127. The Latin&minus;1
Supplement with characters that are used in several European
languages is in the next range, up to 255. After some more
Latin extensions we find the character sets from languages
using non-Roman alphabets, interspersed with a variety of
symbol sets such as currency symbols, Zapf Dingbats or
Braille. (You might want to visit
&lt;https://www.unicode.org/&gt; for a look at some of them
&minus; my personal favourites are Telugu and Kannada.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Unicode
character sets associates characters with integers. Encoding
these numbers in an equal number of bytes would more than
double the requirements for storing texts written in Latin
alphabets. The <small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoding avoids
this by storing the most common (from a western point of
view) characters in a single byte while encoding the rarer
ones in three or more bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl uses
<small>UTF&minus;8,</small> internally, for most Unicode
strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">So what has
this got to do with &quot;pack&quot;? Well, if you want to
compose a Unicode string (that is internally encoded as
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> ), you can do so by using
template code &quot;U&quot;. As an example, let&rsquo;s
produce the Euro currency symbol (code number 0x20AC):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$UTF8{Euro} =
pack( 'U', 0x20AC ); <br>
# Equivalent to: $UTF8{Euro} = &quot;\x{20ac}&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inspecting
$UTF8{Euro} shows that it contains 3 bytes:
&quot;\xe2\x82\xac&quot;. However, it contains only 1
character, number 0x20AC. The round trip can be completed
with &quot;unpack&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$Unicode{Euro}
= unpack( 'U', $UTF8{Euro} );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unpacking using
the &quot;U&quot; template code also works on
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded byte strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Usually
you&rsquo;ll want to pack or unpack
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> strings:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># pack and
unpack the Hebrew alphabet <br>
my $alefbet = pack( 'U*', 0x05d0..0x05ea ); <br>
my @hebrew = unpack( 'U*', $utf );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please note: in
the general case, you&rsquo;re better off using
&quot;Encode::decode('UTF&minus;8', $utf)&quot; to decode a
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded byte string to a Perl
Unicode string, and &quot;Encode::encode('UTF&minus;8',
$str)&quot; to encode a Perl Unicode string to
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> bytes. These functions provide
means of handling invalid byte sequences and generally have
a friendlier interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Another
Portable Binary Encoding</b> <br>
The pack code &quot;w&quot; has been added to support a
portable binary data encoding scheme that goes way beyond
simple integers. (Details can be found at
&lt;https://github.com/mworks&minus;project/mw_scarab/blob/master/Scarab&minus;0.1.00d19/doc/binary&minus;serialization.txt&gt;,
the Scarab project.) A <small>BER</small> (Binary Encoded
Representation) compressed unsigned integer stores base 128
digits, most significant digit first, with as few digits as
possible. Bit eight (the high bit) is set on each byte
except the last. There is no size limit to
<small>BER</small> encoding, but Perl won&rsquo;t go to
extremes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $berbuf =
pack( 'w*', 1, 128, 128+1, 128*128+127 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A hex dump of
$berbuf, with spaces inserted at the right places, shows 01
8100 8101 81807F. Since the last byte is always less than
128, &quot;unpack&quot; knows where to stop.</p>

<h2>Template Grouping
<a name="Template Grouping"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to Perl
5.8, repetitions of templates had to be made by
&quot;x&quot;&minus;multiplication of template strings. Now
there is a better way as we may use the pack codes
&quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; combined with a repeat
count. The &quot;unpack&quot; template from the Stack Frame
example can simply be written like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">unpack( 'v2
(vXXCC)5 v5', $frame )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s
explore this feature a little more. We&rsquo;ll begin with
the equivalent of</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">join( '', map(
substr( $_, 0, 1 ), @str ) )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">which returns a
string consisting of the first character from each string.
Using pack, we can write</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pack(
'(A)'.@str, @str )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or, because a
repeat count &quot;*&quot; means &quot;repeat as often as
required&quot;, simply</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pack( '(A)*',
@str )</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Note that the
template &quot;A*&quot; would only have packed $str[0] in
full length.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To pack dates
stored as triplets ( day, month, year ) in an array @dates
into a sequence of byte, byte, short integer we can
write</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$pd = pack(
'(CCS)*', map( @$_, @dates ) );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To swap pairs
of characters in a string (with even length) one could use
several techniques. First, let&rsquo;s use &quot;x&quot; and
&quot;X&quot; to skip forward and back:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$s = pack(
'(A)*', unpack( '(xAXXAx)*', $s ) );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We can also use
&quot;@&quot; to jump to an offset, with 0 being the
position where we were when the last &quot;(&quot; was
encountered:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$s = pack(
'(A)*', unpack( '(@1A @0A @2)*', $s ) );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, there
is also an entirely different approach by unpacking big
endian shorts and packing them in the reverse byte
order:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$s = pack(
'(v)*', unpack( '(n)*', $s );</p>

<h2>Lengths and Widths
<a name="Lengths and Widths"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>String
Lengths</b> <br>
In the previous section we&rsquo;ve seen a network message
that was constructed by prefixing the binary message length
to the actual message. You&rsquo;ll find that packing a
length followed by so many bytes of data is a frequently
used recipe since appending a null byte won&rsquo;t work if
a null byte may be part of the data. Here is an example
where both techniques are used: after two null terminated
strings with source and destination address, a Short Message
(to a mobile phone) is sent after a length byte:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $msg = pack(
'Z*Z*CA*', $src, $dst, length( $sm ), $sm );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unpacking this
message can be done with the same template:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">( $src, $dst,
$len, $sm ) = unpack( 'Z*Z*CA*', $msg );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s a
subtle trap lurking in the offing: Adding another field
after the Short Message (in variable $sm) is all right when
packing, but this cannot be unpacked naively:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># pack a
message <br>
my $msg = pack( 'Z*Z*CA*C', $src, $dst, length( $sm ), $sm,
$prio ); <br>
# unpack fails &minus; $prio remains undefined! <br>
( $src, $dst, $len, $sm, $prio ) = unpack( 'Z*Z*CA*C', $msg
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pack code
&quot;A*&quot; gobbles up all remaining bytes, and $prio
remains undefined! Before we let disappointment dampen the
morale: Perl&rsquo;s got the trump card to make this trick
too, just a little further up the sleeve. Watch this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># pack a
message: ASCIIZ, ASCIIZ, length/string, byte <br>
my $msg = pack( 'Z* Z* C/A* C', $src, $dst, $sm, $prio );
<br>
# unpack <br>
( $src, $dst, $sm, $prio ) = unpack( 'Z* Z* C/A* C', $msg
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Combining two
pack codes with a slash (&quot;/&quot;) associates them with
a single value from the argument list. In &quot;pack&quot;,
the length of the argument is taken and packed according to
the first code while the argument itself is added after
being converted with the template code after the slash. This
saves us the trouble of inserting the &quot;length&quot;
call, but it is in &quot;unpack&quot; where we really score:
The value of the length byte marks the end of the string to
be taken from the buffer. Since this combination
doesn&rsquo;t make sense except when the second pack code
isn&rsquo;t &quot;a*&quot;, &quot;A*&quot; or
&quot;Z*&quot;, Perl won&rsquo;t let you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The pack code
preceding &quot;/&quot; may be anything that&rsquo;s fit to
represent a number: All the numeric binary pack codes, and
even text codes such as &quot;A4&quot; or
&quot;Z*&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># pack/unpack a
string preceded by its length in ASCII <br>
my $buf = pack( 'A4/A*', &quot;Humpty&minus;Dumpty&quot; );
<br>
# unpack $buf: '13 Humpty&minus;Dumpty' <br>
my $txt = unpack( 'A4/A*', $buf );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;/&quot;
is not implemented in Perls before 5.6, so if your code is
required to work on ancient Perls you&rsquo;ll need to
&quot;unpack( 'Z* Z* C')&quot; to get the length, then use
it to make a new unpack string. For example</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># pack a
message: ASCIIZ, ASCIIZ, length, string, byte <br>
# (5.005 compatible) <br>
my $msg = pack( 'Z* Z* C A* C', $src, $dst, length $sm, $sm,
$prio ); <br>
# unpack <br>
( undef, undef, $len) = unpack( 'Z* Z* C', $msg ); <br>
($src, $dst, $sm, $prio) = unpack ( &quot;Z* Z* x A$len
C&quot;, $msg );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But that second
&quot;unpack&quot; is rushing ahead. It isn&rsquo;t using a
simple literal string for the template. So maybe we should
introduce...</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dynamic
Templates</b> <br>
So far, we&rsquo;ve seen literals used as templates. If the
list of pack items doesn&rsquo;t have fixed length, an
expression constructing the template is required (whenever,
for some reason, &quot;()*&quot; cannot be used).
Here&rsquo;s an example: To store named string values in a
way that can be conveniently parsed by a C program, we
create a sequence of names and null terminated
<small>ASCII</small> strings, with &quot;=&quot; between the
name and the value, followed by an additional delimiting
null byte. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $env = pack(
'(A*A*Z*)' . keys( %Env ) . 'C', <br>
map( { ( $_, '=', $Env{$_} ) } keys( %Env ) ), 0 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s
examine the cogs of this byte mill, one by one.
There&rsquo;s the &quot;map&quot; call, creating the items
we intend to stuff into the $env buffer: to each key (in $_)
it adds the &quot;=&quot; separator and the hash entry
value. Each triplet is packed with the template code
sequence &quot;A*A*Z*&quot; that is repeated according to
the number of keys. (Yes, that&rsquo;s what the
&quot;keys&quot; function returns in scalar context.) To get
the very last null byte, we add a 0 at the end of the
&quot;pack&quot; list, to be packed with &quot;C&quot;.
(Attentive readers may have noticed that we could have
omitted the 0.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the reverse
operation, we&rsquo;ll have to determine the number of items
in the buffer before we can let &quot;unpack&quot; rip it
apart:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $n = $env =~
tr/\0// &minus; 1; <br>
my %env = map( split( /=/, $_ ), unpack( &quot;(Z*)$n&quot;,
$env ) );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;tr&quot; counts the null bytes. The &quot;unpack&quot;
call returns a list of name-value pairs each of which is
taken apart in the &quot;map&quot; block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Counting
Repetitions</b> <br>
Rather than storing a sentinel at the end of a data item (or
a list of items), we could precede the data with a count.
Again, we pack keys and values of a hash, preceding each
with an unsigned short length count, and up front we store
the number of pairs:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $env = pack(
'S(S/A* S/A*)*', scalar keys( %Env ), %Env );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This simplifies
the reverse operation as the number of repetitions can be
unpacked with the &quot;/&quot; code:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my %env =
unpack( 'S/(S/A* S/A*)', $env );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
is one of the rare cases where you cannot use the same
template for &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;unpack&quot; because
&quot;pack&quot; can&rsquo;t determine a repeat count for a
&quot;()&quot;&minus;group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Intel
<small>HEX</small></b> <br>
Intel <small>HEX</small> is a file format for representing
binary data, mostly for programming various chips, as a text
file. (See &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.hex&gt; for a
detailed description, and
&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SREC_(file_format)&gt; for
the Motorola S&minus;record format, which can be unravelled
using the same technique.) Each line begins with a colon
(&rsquo;:&rsquo;) and is followed by a sequence of
hexadecimal characters, specifying a byte count <i>n</i> (8
bit), an address (16 bit, big endian), a record type (8
bit), <i>n</i> data bytes and a checksum (8 bit) computed as
the least significant byte of the two&rsquo;s complement sum
of the preceding bytes. Example:
&quot;:0300300002337A1E&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first step
of processing such a line is the conversion, to binary, of
the hexadecimal data, to obtain the four fields, while
checking the checksum. No surprise here: we&rsquo;ll start
with a simple &quot;pack&quot; call to convert everything to
binary:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $binrec =
pack( 'H*', substr( $hexrec, 1 ) );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The resulting
byte sequence is most convenient for checking the checksum.
Don&rsquo;t slow your program down with a for loop adding
the &quot;ord&quot; values of this string&rsquo;s bytes
&minus; the &quot;unpack&quot; code &quot;%&quot; is the
thing to use for computing the 8&minus;bit sum of all bytes,
which must be equal to zero:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">die unless
unpack( &quot;%8C*&quot;, $binrec ) == 0;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally,
let&rsquo;s get those four fields. By now, you
shouldn&rsquo;t have any problems with the first three
fields &minus; but how can we use the byte count of the data
in the first field as a length for the data field? Here the
codes &quot;x&quot; and &quot;X&quot; come to the rescue, as
they permit jumping back and forth in the string to
unpack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my( $addr,
$type, $data ) = unpack( &quot;x n C X4 C x3 /a&quot;, $bin
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Code
&quot;x&quot; skips a byte, since we don&rsquo;t need the
count yet. Code &quot;n&quot; takes care of the 16&minus;bit
big-endian integer address, and &quot;C&quot; unpacks the
record type. Being at offset 4, where the data begins, we
need the count. &quot;X4&quot; brings us back to square one,
which is the byte at offset 0. Now we pick up the count, and
zoom forth to offset 4, where we are now fully furnished to
extract the exact number of data bytes, leaving the trailing
checksum byte alone.</p>

<h2>Packing and Unpacking C Structures
<a name="Packing and Unpacking C Structures"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In previous
sections we have seen how to pack numbers and character
strings. If it were not for a couple of snags we could
conclude this section right away with the terse remark that
C structures don&rsquo;t contain anything else, and
therefore you already know all there is to it. Sorry, no:
read on, please.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have to
deal with a lot of C structures, and don&rsquo;t want to
hack all your template strings manually, you&rsquo;ll
probably want to have a look at the <small>CPAN</small>
module &quot;Convert::Binary::C&quot;. Not only can it parse
your C source directly, but it also has built-in support for
all the odds and ends described further on in this
section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
Alignment Pit</b> <br>
In the consideration of speed against memory requirements
the balance has been tilted in favor of faster execution.
This has influenced the way C compilers allocate memory for
structures: On architectures where a 16&minus;bit or
32&minus;bit operand can be moved faster between places in
memory, or to or from a <small>CPU</small> register, if it
is aligned at an even or multiple-of-four or even at a
multiple-of eight address, a C compiler will give you this
speed benefit by stuffing extra bytes into structures. If
you don&rsquo;t cross the C shoreline this is not likely to
cause you any grief (although you should care when you
design large data structures, or you want your code to be
portable between architectures (you do want that,
don&rsquo;t you?)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To see how this
affects &quot;pack&quot; and &quot;unpack&quot;, we&rsquo;ll
compare these two C structures:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
char c1; <br>
short s; <br>
char c2; <br>
long l; <br>
} gappy_t; <br>
typedef struct { <br>
long l; <br>
short s; <br>
char c1; <br>
char c2; <br>
} dense_t;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typically, a C
compiler allocates 12 bytes to a &quot;gappy_t&quot;
variable, but requires only 8 bytes for a
&quot;dense_t&quot;. After investigating this further, we
can draw memory maps, showing where the extra 4 bytes are
hidden:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">0 +4 +8 +12
<br>

+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+
<br>
|c1|xx| s |c2|xx|xx|xx| l | xx = fill byte <br>

+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+
<br>
gappy_t <br>
0 +4 +8 <br>

+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+
<br>
| l | h |c1|c2| <br>

+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;+
<br>
dense_t</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And
that&rsquo;s where the first quirk strikes: &quot;pack&quot;
and &quot;unpack&quot; templates have to be stuffed with
&quot;x&quot; codes to get those extra fill bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The natural
question: &quot;Why can&rsquo;t Perl compensate for the
gaps?&quot; warrants an answer. One good reason is that C
compilers might provide (non-ANSI) extensions permitting all
sorts of fancy control over the way structures are aligned,
even at the level of an individual structure field. And, if
this were not enough, there is an insidious thing called
&quot;union&quot; where the amount of fill bytes cannot be
derived from the alignment of the next item alone.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>OK,</small>
so let&rsquo;s bite the bullet. Here&rsquo;s one way to get
the alignment right by inserting template codes
&quot;x&quot;, which don&rsquo;t take a corresponding item
from the list:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $gappy =
pack( 'cxs cxxx l!', $c1, $s, $c2, $l );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note the
&quot;!&quot; after &quot;l&quot;: We want to make sure that
we pack a long integer as it is compiled by our C compiler.
And even now, it will only work for the platforms where the
compiler aligns things as above. And somebody somewhere has
a platform where it doesn&rsquo;t. [Probably a Cray, where
&quot;short&quot;s, &quot;int&quot;s and &quot;long&quot;s
are all 8 bytes. :&minus;)]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Counting bytes
and watching alignments in lengthy structures is bound to be
a drag. Isn&rsquo;t there a way we can create the template
with a simple program? Here&rsquo;s a C program that does
the trick:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#include
&lt;stdio.h&gt; <br>
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt; <br>
typedef struct { <br>
char fc1; <br>
short fs; <br>
char fc2; <br>
long fl; <br>
} gappy_t; <br>
#define Pt(struct,field,tchar) \ <br>
printf( &quot;@%d%s &quot;, offsetof(struct,field), # tchar
); <br>
int main() { <br>
Pt( gappy_t, fc1, c ); <br>
Pt( gappy_t, fs, s! ); <br>
Pt( gappy_t, fc2, c ); <br>
Pt( gappy_t, fl, l! ); <br>
printf( &quot;\n&quot; ); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output line
can be used as a template in a &quot;pack&quot; or
&quot;unpack&quot; call:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $gappy =
pack( '@0c @2s! @4c @8l!', $c1, $s, $c2, $l );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Gee, yet
another template code &minus; as if we hadn&rsquo;t plenty.
But &quot;@&quot; saves our day by enabling us to specify
the offset from the beginning of the pack buffer to the next
item: This is just the value the &quot;offsetof&quot; macro
(defined in &quot;&lt;stddef.h&gt;&quot;) returns when given
a &quot;struct&quot; type and one of its field names
(&quot;member-designator&quot; in C standardese).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Neither using
offsets nor adding &quot;x&quot;&rsquo;s to bridge the gaps
is satisfactory. (Just imagine what happens if the structure
changes.) What we really need is a way of saying &quot;skip
as many bytes as required to the next multiple of N&quot;.
In fluent templates, you say this with &quot;x!N&quot; where
N is replaced by the appropriate value. Here&rsquo;s the
next version of our struct packaging:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $gappy =
pack( 'c x!2 s c x!4 l!', $c1, $s, $c2, $l );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That&rsquo;s
certainly better, but we still have to know how long all the
integers are, and portability is far away. Rather than 2,
for instance, we want to say &quot;however long a short
is&quot;. But this can be done by enclosing the appropriate
pack code in brackets: &quot;[s]&quot;. So, here&rsquo;s the
very best we can do:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $gappy =
pack( 'c x![s] s c x![l!] l!', $c1, $s, $c2, $l );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Dealing with
Endian-ness</b> <br>
Now, imagine that we want to pack the data for a machine
with a different byte-order. First, we&rsquo;ll have to
figure out how big the data types on the target machine
really are. Let&rsquo;s assume that the longs are 32 bits
wide and the shorts are 16 bits wide. You can then rewrite
the template as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $gappy =
pack( 'c x![s] s c x![l] l', $c1, $s, $c2, $l );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the target
machine is little-endian, we could write:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $gappy =
pack( 'c x![s] s&lt; c x![l] l&lt;', $c1, $s, $c2, $l );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This forces the
short and the long members to be little-endian, and is just
fine if you don&rsquo;t have too many struct members. But we
could also use the byte-order modifier on a group and write
the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $gappy =
pack( '( c x![s] s c x![l] l )&lt;', $c1, $s, $c2, $l );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is not as
short as before, but it makes it more obvious that we intend
to have little-endian byte-order for a whole group, not only
for individual template codes. It can also be more readable
and easier to maintain.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Alignment,
Take 2</b> <br>
I&rsquo;m afraid that we&rsquo;re not quite through with the
alignment catch yet. The hydra raises another ugly head when
you pack arrays of structures:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
short count; <br>
char glyph; <br>
} cell_t; <br>
typedef cell_t buffer_t[BUFLEN];</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where&rsquo;s
the catch? Padding is neither required before the first
field &quot;count&quot;, nor between this and the next field
&quot;glyph&quot;, so why can&rsquo;t we simply pack like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># something
goes wrong here: <br>
pack( 's!a' x @buffer, <br>
map{ ( $_&minus;&gt;{count}, $_&minus;&gt;{glyph} ) }
@buffer );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This packs
&quot;3*@buffer&quot; bytes, but it turns out that the size
of &quot;buffer_t&quot; is four times &quot;BUFLEN&quot;!
The moral of the story is that the required alignment of a
structure or array is propagated to the next higher level
where we have to consider padding <i>at the end</i> of each
component as well. Thus the correct template is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pack( 's!ax' x
@buffer, <br>
map{ ( $_&minus;&gt;{count}, $_&minus;&gt;{glyph} ) }
@buffer );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Alignment,
Take 3</b> <br>
And even if you take all the above into account,
<small>ANSI</small> still lets this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
{ <br>
char foo[2]; <br>
} foo_t;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">vary in size.
The alignment constraint of the structure can be greater
than any of its elements. [And if you think that this
doesn&rsquo;t affect anything common, dismember the next
cellphone that you see. Many have <small>ARM</small> cores,
and the <small>ARM</small> structure rules make &quot;sizeof
(foo_t)&quot; == 4]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pointers for
How to Use Them</b> <br>
The title of this section indicates the second problem you
may run into sooner or later when you pack C structures. If
the function you intend to call expects a, say, &quot;void
*&quot; value, you <i>cannot</i> simply take a reference to
a Perl variable. (Although that value certainly is a memory
address, it&rsquo;s not the address where the
variable&rsquo;s contents are stored.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Template code
&quot;P&quot; promises to pack a &quot;pointer to a fixed
length string&quot;. Isn&rsquo;t this what we want?
Let&rsquo;s try:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># allocate some
storage and pack a pointer to it <br>
my $memory = &quot;\x00&quot; x $size; <br>
my $memptr = pack( 'P', $memory );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But wait:
doesn&rsquo;t &quot;pack&quot; just return a sequence of
bytes? How can we pass this string of bytes to some C code
expecting a pointer which is, after all, nothing but a
number? The answer is simple: We have to obtain the numeric
address from the bytes returned by &quot;pack&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $ptr =
unpack( 'L!', $memptr );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Obviously this
assumes that it is possible to typecast a pointer to an
unsigned long and vice versa, which frequently works but
should not be taken as a universal law. &minus; Now that we
have this pointer the next question is: How can we put it to
good use? We need a call to some C function where a pointer
is expected. The <b>read</b>(2) system call comes to
mind:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ssize_t
read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After reading
perlfunc explaining how to use &quot;syscall&quot; we can
write this Perl function copying a file to standard
output:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">require
'syscall.ph'; # run h2ph to generate this file <br>
sub cat($){ <br>
my $path = shift(); <br>
my $size = &minus;s $path; <br>
my $memory = &quot;\x00&quot; x $size; # allocate some
memory <br>
my $ptr = unpack( 'L', pack( 'P', $memory ) ); <br>
open( F, $path ) || die( &quot;$path: cannot open
($!)\n&quot; ); <br>
my $fd = fileno(F); <br>
my $res = syscall( &amp;SYS_read, fileno(F), $ptr, $size );
<br>
print $memory; <br>
close( F ); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is neither
a specimen of simplicity nor a paragon of portability but it
illustrates the point: We are able to sneak behind the
scenes and access Perl&rsquo;s otherwise well-guarded
memory! (Important note: Perl&rsquo;s &quot;syscall&quot;
does <i>not</i> require you to construct pointers in this
roundabout way. You simply pass a string variable, and Perl
forwards the address.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">How does
&quot;unpack&quot; with &quot;P&quot; work? Imagine some
pointer in the buffer about to be unpacked: If it
isn&rsquo;t the null pointer (which will smartly produce the
&quot;undef&quot; value) we have a start address &minus; but
then what? Perl has no way of knowing how long this
&quot;fixed length string&quot; is, so it&rsquo;s up to you
to specify the actual size as an explicit length after
&quot;P&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $mem =
&quot;abcdefghijklmn&quot;; <br>
print unpack( 'P5', pack( 'P', $mem ) ); # prints
&quot;abcde&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a
consequence, &quot;pack&quot; ignores any number or
&quot;*&quot; after &quot;P&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now that we
have seen &quot;P&quot; at work, we might as well give
&quot;p&quot; a whirl. Why do we need a second template code
for packing pointers at all? The answer lies behind the
simple fact that an &quot;unpack&quot; with &quot;p&quot;
promises a null-terminated string starting at the address
taken from the buffer, and that implies a length for the
data item to be returned:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $buf = pack(
'p', &quot;abc\x00efhijklmn&quot; ); <br>
print unpack( 'p', $buf ); # prints &quot;abc&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Albeit this is
apt to be confusing: As a consequence of the length being
implied by the string&rsquo;s length, a number after pack
code &quot;p&quot; is a repeat count, not a length as after
&quot;P&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using
&quot;pack(..., $x)&quot; with &quot;P&quot; or
&quot;p&quot; to get the address where $x is actually stored
must be used with circumspection. Perl&rsquo;s internal
machinery considers the relation between a variable and that
address as its very own private matter and doesn&rsquo;t
really care that we have obtained a copy. Therefore:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Do not use &quot;pack&quot; with
&quot;p&quot; or &quot;P&quot; to obtain the address of
variable that&rsquo;s bound to go out of scope (and thereby
freeing its memory) before you are done with using the
memory at that address.</p></td></tr>

<p>Be very careful with Perl operations that change the
value of the variable. Appending something to the variable,
for instance, might require reallocation of its storage,
leaving you with a pointer into no-man&rsquo;s land.</p></td></tr>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think that you can get the address of a Perl
variable when it is stored as an integer or double number!
&quot;pack('P', $x)&quot; will force the variable&rsquo;s
internal representation to string, just as if you had
written something like &quot;$x .= ''&quot;.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
safe, however, to P&minus; or p&minus;pack a string literal,
because Perl simply allocates an anonymous variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are a
collection of (possibly) useful canned recipes for
&quot;pack&quot; and &quot;unpack&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># Convert IP
address for socket functions <br>
pack( &quot;C4&quot;, split /\./, &quot;123.4.5.6&quot; );
<br>
# Count the bits in a chunk of memory (e.g. a select vector)
<br>
unpack( '%32b*', $mask ); <br>
# Determine the endianness of your system <br>
$is_little_endian = unpack( 'c', pack( 's', 1 ) ); <br>
$is_big_endian = unpack( 'xc', pack( 's', 1 ) ); <br>
# Determine the number of bits in a native integer <br>
$bits = unpack( '%32I!', ~0 ); <br>
# Prepare argument for the nanosleep system call <br>
my $timespec = pack( 'L!L!', $secs, $nanosecs );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a simple
memory dump we unpack some bytes into just as many pairs of
hex digits, and use &quot;map&quot; to handle the
traditional spacing &minus; 16 bytes to a line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $i; <br>
print map( ++$i % 16 ? &quot;$_ &quot; : &quot;$_\n&quot;,
<br>
unpack( 'H2' x length( $mem ), $mem ) ), <br>
length( $mem ) % 16 ? &quot;\n&quot; : '';</p>
