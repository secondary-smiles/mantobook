Perl Rules of Governance</p>

<h2>PREAMBLE
<a name="PREAMBLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We are forming
a system of governance for development of the Perl
programming language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The scope of
governance includes the language definition, its
implementation, its test suite, its documentation, and the
policies and procedures by which it is developed and
maintained.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The system of
governance includes definitions of the groups that will make
decisions, the rules by which these groups are formed and
changed, and the enumerated powers and constraints on the
activities of these governing groups.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In forming a
system of governance, we seek to achieve the following
goals:</p>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>We want a system that is functional. That means the
governing groups may decide to undertake large changes, or
they may decide to act conservatively, but they will act
with intent and clear communication rather than fail to
reach decisions when needed.</p></td></tr>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>

<p>We want a system that is trusted. That means that a
reasonable contributor to Perl might disagree with decisions
made by the governing groups, but will accept that they were
made in good faith in consultation with relevant communities
outside the governing groups.</p></td></tr>

members to the governing groups, ways to survive members
becoming inactive, and ways of amending the rules of
governance themselves if needed.</p></td></tr>
