<h2>NAME

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">texfot &minus;
run TeX, filtering online transcript for interesting
messages</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">texfot
[<i>option</i>]... <i>texcmd</i> [<i>texarg</i>...]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;texfot&quot;
invokes <i>texcmd</i> with the given <i>texarg</i>
arguments, filtering the online output for
&lsquo;&lsquo;interesting&rsquo;&rsquo; messages. Its exit
value is that of <i>texcmd</i>. Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># Sample basic
invocation: <br>
texfot pdflatex file.tex <br>
# Ordinarily the full output is copied to /tmp/fot.$UID
before <br>
# filtering, but that can be omitted, or the filename
changed: <br>
texfot &minus;&minus;tee=/dev/null lualatex file.tex <br>
# Example of more complex engine invocation: <br>
texfot xelatex &minus;&minus;recorder '\nonstopmode\input
file'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Aside from its
own options, described below, &quot;texfot&quot; just runs
the given command with the given arguments (same approach to
command line syntax as &quot;env&quot;, &quot;nice&quot;,
&quot;time&quot;, &quot;timeout&quot;, etc.). Thus,
&quot;texfot&quot; works with any engine and any command
line options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;texfot&quot;
does not look at the log file or any other possible output
file(s); it only looks at the standard output and standard
error from the command. stdout is processed first, then
stderr. Lines from stderr have an identifying prefix.
&quot;texfot&quot; writes all accepted lines to its
stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The messages
shown are intended to be those which likely need action by
the author: error messages, overfull and underfull boxes,
undefined citations, missing characters from fonts, etc.</p>

<h2>FLOW OF OPERATION
<a name="FLOW OF OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is the
order in which lines of output are checked:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If the &lsquo;&lsquo;next line&rsquo;&rsquo; needs to be
printed (see below), print it.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Otherwise, if the line matches the built-in list of
regexps to ignore, or any user-supplied list of regexps to
ignore (given with &quot;&minus;&minus;ignore&quot;, see
below), in that order, ignore it.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Otherwise, if the line matches the list of regexps for
which the next line (two lines in all) should be shown, show
this line and set the &lsquo;&lsquo;next line&rsquo;&rsquo;
flag for the next time around the loop. Examples are the
common &quot;!&quot; and &quot;filename:lineno:&quot; error
messages, which are generally followed by a line with
specific detail about the error.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>4.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Otherwise, if the line matches the list of regexps to
show, show it.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>5.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>Otherwise, the default: if the line came from stdout,
ignore it; if the line came from stderr, print it (to
stdout). This distinction is made because TeX engines write
relatively few messages to stderr, and it&rsquo;s likely
that any such should be considered.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It would be
easy to add more options to allow for user additions to the
various regex lists, if that ever seems useful. Or email me
(see end).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once a
particular check matches, the program moves on to process
the next line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Don&rsquo;t
hesitate to peruse the source to the script, which is
essentially a straightforward loop matching against the
different lists as above. You can see the exact regexps
being matched in the different categories in the source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Incidentally,
although nothing in this basic operation is specific to TeX
engines, all the regular expressions included in the program
are specific to TeX. So in practice the program isn&rsquo;t
useful except with TeX engines, although it would be easy
enough to adapt it (if there was anything else as verbose as
TeX to make that useful).</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
are the options to &quot;texfot&quot; itself (not the TeX
engine being invoked; consult the TeX documentation or the
engine&rsquo;s &quot;&minus;&minus;help&quot; output for
that).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
non-option terminates &quot;texfot&quot;&rsquo;s option
parsing, and the remainder of the command line is invoked as
the TeX command, without further parsing. For example,
&quot;texfot &minus;&minus;debug tex
&minus;&minus;debug&quot; will output debugging information
from both &quot;texfot&quot; and &quot;tex&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Options may
start with either &minus; or &minus;&minus;, and may be
unambiguously abbreviated. It is best to use the full option
name in scripts, though, to avoid possible collisions with
new options in the future. <br>
&quot;&minus;&minus;debug&quot; <br>
&quot;&minus;&minus;no&minus;debug&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Output (or not) what is being
done on standard error. Off by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;&minus;ignore&quot;
<i>regexp</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignore lines in the TeX output
matching (Perl) <i>regexp</i>. Can be repeated. Adds to the
default set of ignore regexps rather than replacing. These
regexps are not automatically anchored (or otherwise
altered), simply used as-is.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;&minus;interactive&quot;
<br>
&quot;&minus;&minus;no&minus;interactive&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, standard input to
the TeX process is closed so that TeX&rsquo;s interactive
mode (waiting for input upon error, the &quot;*&quot;
prompt, etc.) is never entered. Giving
&quot;&minus;&minus;interactive&quot; allows interaction to
happen.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;&minus;quiet&quot;
<br>
&quot;&minus;&minus;no&minus;quiet&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, the TeX command
being invoked is reported on standard output.
&quot;&minus;&minus;quiet&quot; omits that reporting. To get
a completely silent run, redirect standard output:
&quot;texfot&nbsp;...&nbsp;&gt;/dev/null&quot;. (The only
messages to standard error should be errors from
&quot;texfot&quot; itself, so it shouldn&rsquo;t be
necessary to redirect that, but of course that can be done
as well.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;&minus;stderr&quot;
<br>
&quot;&minus;&minus;no&minus;stderr&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default is for
&quot;texfot&quot; to report everything written to stderr by
the TeX command (on stdout).
&quot;&minus;&minus;no&minus;stderr&quot; omits that
reporting. (Some programs, &quot;dvisvgm&quot; is one, can
be rather verbose on stderr.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;&minus;tee&quot;
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, the output being
filtered is &quot;tee&quot;&minus;ed, before filtering, to
make it easy to check the full output in case of
problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
<i>file</i> is &quot;$TMPDIR/fot.&quot;<i>uid</i>; if
&quot;TMPDIR&quot; is not set, &quot;TMP&quot; is used if
set; if neither is set, the default directory is
&quot;/tmp&quot;. For example: &quot;/tmp/fot.1001&quot;.
The <i>uid</i> suffix is the effective userid of the
process, appended for basic avoidance of collisions between
different users on the same system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
allows specifying a different file. Use
&quot;&minus;&minus;tee&nbsp;/dev/null&quot; to discard the
original output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;&minus;version&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Output version information and
exit successfully.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;&minus;help&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Display this help and exit
successfully.</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I wrote this
because, in my work as a TUGboat editor
(&lt;https://tug.org/TUGboat&gt;, journal submissions always
welcome!), I run and rerun many documents, many times each.
It was easy to lose warnings I needed to see in the mass of
unvarying and uninteresting output from TeX, such as style
files being read and fonts being used. I wanted to see all
and only those messages which needed some action by me.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">I found some
other programs of a similar nature, the LaTeX package
&quot;silence&quot;, and plenty of other (La)TeX wrappers,
but it seemed none of them did what I wanted. Either they
read the log file (I wanted the online output only), or they
output more or less than I wanted, or they required invoking
TeX differently (I wanted to keep my build process exactly
the same, most critically the TeX invocation, which can get
complicated). Hence I wrote this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
keywords if you want to explore other options:
texloganalyser, pydflatex, logfilter, latexmk, rubber,
arara, and searching for &quot;log&quot; at
&lt;https://ctan.org/search&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;texfot&quot;
is written in Perl, and runs on Unix. It may work on Windows
if Perl and other software is installed, but I don&rsquo;t
use Windows and don&rsquo;t support &quot;texfot&quot;
there.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The name comes
from the &quot;trip.fot&quot; and &quot;trap.fot&quot; files
that are part of Knuth&rsquo;s trip and trap torture tests,
which record the online output from the programs. I am not
sure what &quot;fot&quot; stands for in trip and trap, but I
can pretend that it stands for &quot;filter online
transcript&quot; in the present case&nbsp;:).</p>
