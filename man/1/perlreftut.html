<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlreftut
&minus; Mark&rsquo;s very short tutorial about
references</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the most
important new features in Perl 5 was the capability to
manage complicated data structures like multidimensional
arrays and nested hashes. To enable these, Perl 5 introduced
a feature called <i>references</i>, and using references is
the key to managing complicated, structured data in Perl.
Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s a lot of funny syntax to learn,
and the main manual page can be hard to follow. The manual
is quite complete, and sometimes people find that a problem,
because it can be hard to tell what is important and what
isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Fortunately,
you only need to know 10% of what&rsquo;s in the main page
to get 90% of the benefit. This page will show you that
10%.</p>

<h2>Who Needs Complicated Data Structures?
<a name="Who Needs Complicated Data Structures?"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One problem
that comes up all the time is needing a hash whose values
are lists. Perl has hashes, of course, but the values have
to be scalars; they can&rsquo;t be lists.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Why would you
want a hash of lists? Let&rsquo;s take a simple example: You
have a file of city and country names, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Chicago, USA
<br>
Frankfurt, Germany <br>
Berlin, Germany <br>
Washington, USA <br>
Helsinki, Finland <br>
New York, USA</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and you want to
produce an output like this, with each country mentioned
once, and then an alphabetical list of the cities in that
country:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finland:
Helsinki. <br>
Germany: Berlin, Frankfurt. <br>
USA: Chicago, New York, Washington.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The natural way
to do this is to have a hash whose keys are country names.
Associated with each country name key is a list of the
cities in that country. Each time you read a line of input,
split it into a country and a city, look up the list of
cities already known to be in that country, and append the
new city to the list. When you&rsquo;re done reading the
input, iterate over the hash as usual, sorting each list of
cities before you print it out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If hash values
couldn&rsquo;t be lists, you lose. You&rsquo;d probably have
to combine all the cities into a single string somehow, and
then when time came to write the output, you&rsquo;d have to
break the string into a list, sort the list, and turn it
back into a string. This is messy and error-prone. And
it&rsquo;s frustrating, because Perl already has perfectly
good lists that would solve the problem if only you could
use them.</p>

<h2>The Solution
<a name="The Solution"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By the time
Perl 5 rolled around, we were already stuck with this
design: Hash values must be scalars. The solution to this is
references.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A reference is
a scalar value that <i>refers to</i> an entire array or an
entire hash (or to just about anything else). Names are one
kind of reference that you&rsquo;re already familiar with.
Each human being is a messy, inconvenient collection of
cells. But to refer to a particular human, for instance the
first computer programmer, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to
describe each of their cells; all you need is the easy,
convenient scalar string &quot;Ada Lovelace&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">References in
Perl are like names for arrays and hashes. They&rsquo;re
Perl&rsquo;s private, internal names, so you can be sure
they&rsquo;re unambiguous. Unlike a human name, a reference
only refers to one thing, and you always know what it refers
to. If you have a reference to an array, you can recover the
entire array from it. If you have a reference to a hash, you
can recover the entire hash. But the reference is still an
easy, compact scalar value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can&rsquo;t
have a hash whose values are arrays; hash values can only be
scalars. We&rsquo;re stuck with that. But a single reference
can refer to an entire array, and references are scalars, so
you can have a hash of references to arrays, and it&rsquo;ll
act a lot like a hash of arrays, and it&rsquo;ll be just as
useful as a hash of arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ll
come back to this city-country problem later, after
we&rsquo;ve seen some syntax for managing references.</p>

<h2>Syntax
<a name="Syntax"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are just
two ways to make a reference, and just two ways to use it
once you have it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Making
References</b> <b><i><br>
Make Rule 1</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you put a
&quot;\&quot; in front of a variable, you get a reference to
that variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$aref =
\@array; # $aref now holds a reference to @array <br>
$href = \%hash; # $href now holds a reference to %hash <br>
$sref = \$scalar; # $sref now holds a reference to
$scalar</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once the
reference is stored in a variable like $aref or $href, you
can copy it or store it just the same as any other scalar
value:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$xy = $aref; #
$xy now holds a reference to @array <br>
$p[3] = $href; # $p[3] now holds a reference to %hash <br>
$z = $p[3]; # $z now holds a reference to %hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These examples
show how to make references to variables with names.
Sometimes you want to make an array or a hash that
doesn&rsquo;t have a name. This is analogous to the way you
like to be able to use the string &quot;\n&quot; or the
number 80 without having to store it in a named variable
first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>Make Rule
2</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;[ ITEMS
]&quot; makes a new, anonymous array, and returns a
reference to that array. &quot;{ ITEMS }&quot; makes a new,
anonymous hash, and returns a reference to that hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$aref = [ 1,
&quot;foo&quot;, undef, 13 ]; <br>
# $aref now holds a reference to an array <br>
$href = { APR =&gt; 4, AUG =&gt; 8 }; <br>
# $href now holds a reference to a hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The references
you get from rule 2 are the same kind of references that you
get from rule 1:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># This: <br>
$aref = [ 1, 2, 3 ]; <br>
# Does the same as this: <br>
@array = (1, 2, 3); <br>
$aref = \@array;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first line
is an abbreviation for the following two lines, except that
it doesn&rsquo;t create the superfluous array variable
@array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you write
just &quot;[]&quot;, you get a new, empty anonymous array.
If you write just &quot;{}&quot;, you get a new, empty
anonymous hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
References</b> <br>
What can you do with a reference once you have it?
It&rsquo;s a scalar value, and we&rsquo;ve seen that you can
store it as a scalar and get it back again just like any
scalar. There are just two more ways to use it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>Use Rule
1</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can always
use an array reference, in curly braces, in place of the
name of an array. For example, &quot;@{$aref}&quot; instead
of @array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
examples of that:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arrays:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@a @{$aref} An
array <br>
reverse @a reverse @{$aref} Reverse the array <br>
$a[3] ${$aref}[3] An element of the array <br>
$a[3] = 17; ${$aref}[3] = 17 Assigning an element</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On each line
are two expressions that do the same thing. The left-hand
versions operate on the array @a. The right-hand versions
operate on the array that is referred to by $aref. Once they
find the array they&rsquo;re operating on, both versions do
the same things to the arrays.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using a hash
reference is <i>exactly</i> the same:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%h %{$href} A
hash <br>
keys %h keys %{$href} Get the keys from the hash <br>
$h{'red'} ${$href}{'red'} An element of the hash <br>
$h{'red'} = 17 ${$href}{'red'} = 17 Assigning an element</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whatever you
want to do with a reference, <b>Use Rule 1</b> tells you how
to do it. You just write the Perl code that you would have
written for doing the same thing to a regular array or hash,
and then replace the array or hash name with
&quot;{$reference}&quot;. &quot;How do I loop over an array
when all I have is a reference?&quot; Well, to loop over an
array, you would write</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for my $element
(@array) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">so replace the
array name, @array, with the reference:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for my $element
(@{$aref}) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;How do I
print out the contents of a hash when all I have is a
reference?&quot; First write the code for printing out a
hash:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for my $key
(keys %hash) { <br>
print &quot;$key =&gt; $hash{$key}\n&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And then
replace the hash name with the reference:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for my $key
(keys %{$href}) { <br>
print &quot;$key =&gt; ${$href}{$key}\n&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>Use Rule
2</i></b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Use Rule
1</b> is all you really need, because it tells you how to do
absolutely everything you ever need to do with references.
But the most common thing to do with an array or a hash is
to extract a single element, and the <b>Use Rule 1</b>
notation is cumbersome. So there is an abbreviation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;${$aref}[3]&quot;
is too hard to read, so you can write
&quot;$aref&minus;&gt;[3]&quot; instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;${$href}{red}&quot;
is too hard to read, so you can write
&quot;$href&minus;&gt;{red}&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If $aref holds
a reference to an array, then
&quot;$aref&minus;&gt;[3]&quot; is the fourth element of the
array. Don&rsquo;t confuse this with $aref[3], which is the
fourth element of a totally different array, one deceptively
named @aref. $aref and @aref are unrelated the same way that
$item and @item are.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
&quot;$href&minus;&gt;{'red'}&quot; is part of the hash
referred to by the scalar variable $href, perhaps even one
with no name. $href{'red'} is part of the deceptively named
%href hash. It&rsquo;s easy to forget to leave out the
&quot;&minus;&gt;&quot;, and if you do, you&rsquo;ll get
bizarre results when your program gets array and hash
elements out of totally unexpected hashes and arrays that
weren&rsquo;t the ones you wanted to use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>An
Example</b> <br>
Let&rsquo;s see a quick example of how all this is
useful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, remember
that &quot;[1, 2, 3]&quot; makes an anonymous array
containing &quot;(1, 2, 3)&quot;, and gives you a reference
to that array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now think
about</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@a = ( [1, 2,
3], <br>
[4, 5, 6], <br>
[7, 8, 9] <br>
);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@a is an array
with three elements, and each one is a reference to another
array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$a[1] is one of
these references. It refers to an array, the array
containing &quot;(4, 5, 6)&quot;, and because it is a
reference to an array, <b>Use Rule 2</b> says that we can
write $a[1]&minus;&gt;[2] to get the third element from that
array. $a[1]&minus;&gt;[2] is the 6. Similarly,
$a[0]&minus;&gt;[1] is the 2. What we have here is like a
two-dimensional array; you can write
$a[ROW]&minus;&gt;[COLUMN] to get or set the element in any
row and any column of the array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The notation
still looks a little cumbersome, so there&rsquo;s one more
abbreviation:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Arrow
Rule</b> <br>
In between two <b>subscripts</b>, the arrow is optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of
$a[1]&minus;&gt;[2], we can write $a[1][2]; it means the
same thing. Instead of &quot;$a[0]&minus;&gt;[1] = 23&quot;,
we can write &quot;$a[0][1] = 23&quot;; it means the same
thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now it really
looks like two-dimensional arrays!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can see why
the arrows are important. Without them, we would have had to
write &quot;${$a[1]}[2]&quot; instead of $a[1][2]. For
three-dimensional arrays, they let us write $x[2][3][5]
instead of the unreadable &quot;${${$x[2]}[3]}[5]&quot;.</p>

<h2>Solution
<a name="Solution"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
the answer to the problem I posed earlier, of reformatting a
file of city and country names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">1 my %table;
<br>
2 while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
3 chomp; <br>
4 my ($city, $country) = split /, /; <br>
5 $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country}; <br>
6 push @{$table{$country}}, $city; <br>
7 } <br>
8 for my $country (sort keys %table) { <br>
9 print &quot;$country: &quot;; <br>
10 my @cities = @{$table{$country}}; <br>
11 print join ', ', sort @cities; <br>
12 print &quot;.\n&quot;; <br>
13 }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program has
two pieces: Lines 2&minus;7 read the input and build a data
structure, and lines 8&minus;13 analyze the data and print
out the report. We&rsquo;re going to have a hash, %table,
whose keys are country names, and whose values are
references to arrays of city names. The data structure will
look like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%table <br>

+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>
| | |
+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>
|Germany| *&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt;| Frankfurt |
Berlin | <br>
| | |
+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>

+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>
| | |
+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>
|Finland| *&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt;| Helsinki | <br>
| | |
+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>

+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>
| | |
+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>
| USA | *&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&gt;| Chicago |
Washington | New York | <br>
| | |
+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+
<br>

+&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;+&minus;&minus;&minus;+</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We&rsquo;ll
look at output first. Supposing we already have this
structure, how do we print it out?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">8 for my
$country (sort keys %table) { <br>
9 print &quot;$country: &quot;; <br>
10 my @cities = @{$table{$country}}; <br>
11 print join ', ', sort @cities; <br>
12 print &quot;.\n&quot;; <br>
13 }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%table is an
ordinary hash, and we get a list of keys from it, sort the
keys, and loop over the keys as usual. The only use of
references is in line 10. $table{$country} looks up the key
$country in the hash and gets the value, which is a
reference to an array of cities in that country. <b>Use Rule
1</b> says that we can recover the array by saying
&quot;@{$table{$country}}&quot;. Line 10 is just like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@cities =
@array;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">except that the
name &quot;array&quot; has been replaced by the reference
&quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;. The &quot;@&quot; tells Perl
to get the entire array. Having gotten the list of cities,
we sort it, join it, and print it out as usual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lines 2&minus;7
are responsible for building the structure in the first
place. Here they are again:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2 while
(&lt;&gt;) { <br>
3 chomp; <br>
4 my ($city, $country) = split /, /; <br>
5 $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country}; <br>
6 push @{$table{$country}}, $city; <br>
7 }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Lines 2&minus;4
acquire a city and country name. Line 5 looks to see if the
country is already present as a key in the hash. If
it&rsquo;s not, the program uses the &quot;[]&quot; notation
(<b>Make Rule 2</b>) to manufacture a new, empty anonymous
array of cities, and installs a reference to it into the
hash under the appropriate key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Line 6 installs
the city name into the appropriate array. $table{$country}
now holds a reference to the array of cities seen in that
country so far. Line 6 is exactly like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">push @array,
$city;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">except that the
name &quot;array&quot; has been replaced by the reference
&quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;. The &quot;push&quot; adds a
city name to the end of the referred-to array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s
one fine point I skipped. Line 5 is unnecessary, and we can
get rid of it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">2 while
(&lt;&gt;) { <br>
3 chomp; <br>
4 my ($city, $country) = split /, /; <br>
5 #### $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
<br>
6 push @{$table{$country}}, $city; <br>
7 }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
there&rsquo;s already an entry in %table for the current
$country, then nothing is different. Line 6 will locate the
value in $table{$country}, which is a reference to an array,
and push $city into the array. But what does it do when
$country holds a key, say &quot;Greece&quot;, that is not
yet in %table?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is Perl,
so it does the exact right thing. It sees that you want to
push &quot;Athens&quot; onto an array that doesn&rsquo;t
exist, so it helpfully makes a new, empty, anonymous array
for you, installs it into %table, and then pushes
&quot;Athens&quot; onto it. This is called
<i>autovivification</i>&minus;&minus;bringing things to life
automatically. Perl saw that the key wasn&rsquo;t in the
hash, so it created a new hash entry automatically. Perl saw
that you wanted to use the hash value as an array, so it
created a new empty array and installed a reference to it in
the hash automatically. And as usual, Perl made the array
one element longer to hold the new city name.</p>

give you 90% of the benefit with 10% of the details, and
that means I left out 90% of the details. Now that you have
an overview of the important parts, it should be easier to

&quot;$aref1&minus;&gt;[23]&quot; and then look at
&quot;$aref2&minus;&gt;[23]&quot; you&rsquo;ll see the
change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To copy the
array, use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$aref2 =
[@{$aref1}];</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This uses
&quot;[...]&quot; notation to create a new anonymous array,
and $aref2 is assigned a reference to the new array. The new
array is initialized with the contents of the array referred
to by $aref1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, to
copy an anonymous hash, you can use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$href2 =
{%{$href1}};</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">To see if a variable contains a
reference, use the &quot;ref&quot; function. It returns true
if its argument is a reference. Actually it&rsquo;s a little
better than that: It returns &quot;HASH&quot; for hash
references and &quot;ARRAY&quot; for array references.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>If you try to use a reference like a string, you get
strings like</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">ARRAY(0x80f5dec)
or HASH(0x826afc0)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you ever see
a string that looks like this, you&rsquo;ll know you printed
out a reference by mistake.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A side effect
of this representation is that you can use &quot;eq&quot; to
see if two references refer to the same thing. (But you
should usually use &quot;==&quot; instead because it&rsquo;s
much faster.)</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">You can use a string as if it
were a reference. If you use the string &quot;foo&quot; as
an array reference, it&rsquo;s taken to be a reference to
the array @foo. This is called a <i>symbolic reference</i>.
The declaration &quot;use strict 'refs'&quot; disables this
feature, which can cause all sorts of trouble if you use it
by accident.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might
prefer to go on to perllol instead of perlref; it discusses
lists of lists and multidimensional arrays in detail. After
that, you should move on to perldsc; it&rsquo;s a Data
Structure Cookbook that shows recipes for using and printing
out arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, and other kinds of
data.</p>

<h2>Summary
<a name="Summary"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Everyone needs
compound data structures, and in Perl the way you get them
is with references. There are four important rules for
managing references: Two for making references and two for
using them. Once you know these rules you can do most of the
important things you need to do with references.</p>
