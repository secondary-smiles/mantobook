<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Perl program
consists of a sequence of declarations and statements which
run from the top to the bottom. Loops, subroutines, and
other control structures allow you to jump around within the
code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl is a
<b>free-form</b> language: you can format and indent it
however you like. Whitespace serves mostly to separate
tokens, unlike languages like Python where it is an
important part of the syntax, or Fortran where it is
immaterial.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many of
Perl&rsquo;s syntactic elements are <b>optional</b>. Rather
than requiring you to put parentheses around every function
call and declare every variable, you can often leave such
explicit elements off and Perl will figure out what you
meant. This is known as <b>Do What I Mean</b>, abbreviated
<b><small>DWIM</small></b> . It allows programmers to be
<b>lazy</b> and to code in a style with which they are
comfortable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl <b>borrows
syntax</b> and concepts from many languages: awk, sed, C,
Bourne Shell, Smalltalk, Lisp and even English. Other
languages have borrowed syntax from Perl, particularly its
regular expression extensions. So if you have programmed in
another language you will see familiar pieces in Perl. They
often work the same, but see perltrap for information about
how they differ.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Declarations</b>
<br>
The only things you need to declare in Perl are report
formats and subroutines (and sometimes not even
subroutines). A scalar variable holds the undefined value
(&quot;undef&quot;) until it has been assigned a defined
value, which is anything other than &quot;undef&quot;. When
used as a number, &quot;undef&quot; is treated as 0; when
used as a string, it is treated as the empty string,
&quot;&quot;; and when used as a reference that isn&rsquo;t
being assigned to, it is treated as an error. If you enable
warnings, you&rsquo;ll be notified of an uninitialized value
whenever you treat &quot;undef&quot; as a string or a
number. Well, usually. Boolean contexts, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if ($a) {}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">are exempt from
warnings (because they care about truth rather than
definedness). Operators such as &quot;++&quot;,
&quot;&minus;&minus;&quot;, &quot;+=&quot;,
&quot;&minus;=&quot;, and &quot;.=&quot;, that operate on
undefined variables such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">undef $a; <br>
$a++;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">are also always
exempt from such warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A declaration
can be put anywhere a statement can, but has no effect on
the execution of the primary sequence of statements:
declarations all take effect at compile time. All
declarations are typically put at the beginning or the end
of the script. However, if you&rsquo;re using
lexically-scoped private variables created with
&quot;my()&quot;, &quot;state()&quot;, or &quot;our()&quot;,
you&rsquo;ll have to make sure your format or subroutine
definition is within the same block scope as the my if you
expect to be able to access those private variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Declaring a
subroutine allows a subroutine name to be used as if it were
a list operator from that point forward in the program. You
can declare a subroutine without defining it by saying
&quot;sub name&quot;, thus:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub myname;
<br>
$me = myname $0 or die &quot;can't get myname&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A bare
declaration like that declares the function to be a list
operator, not a unary operator, so you have to be careful to
use parentheses (or &quot;or&quot; instead of
&quot;||&quot;.) The &quot;||&quot; operator binds too
tightly to use after list operators; it becomes part of the
last element. You can always use parentheses around the list
operators arguments to turn the list operator back into
something that behaves more like a function call.
Alternatively, you can use the prototype &quot;($)&quot; to
turn the subroutine into a unary operator:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub myname ($);
<br>
$me = myname $0 || die &quot;can't get myname&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That now parses
as you&rsquo;d expect, but you still ought to get in the
habit of using parentheses in that situation. For more on
prototypes, see perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Subroutines
declarations can also be loaded up with the
&quot;require&quot; statement or both loaded and imported
into your namespace with a &quot;use&quot; statement. See
perlmod for details on this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A statement
sequence may contain declarations of lexically-scoped
variables, but apart from declaring a variable name, the
declaration acts like an ordinary statement, and is
elaborated within the sequence of statements as if it were
an ordinary statement. That means it actually has both
compile-time and run-time effects.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Comments</b>
<br>
Text from a &quot;#&quot; character until the end of the
line is a comment, and is ignored. Exceptions include
&quot;#&quot; inside a string or regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Simple
Statements</b> <br>
The only kind of simple statement is an expression evaluated
for its side-effects. Every simple statement must be
terminated with a semicolon, unless it is the final
statement in a block, in which case the semicolon is
optional. But put the semicolon in anyway if the block takes
up more than one line, because you may eventually add
another line. Note that there are operators like &quot;eval
{}&quot;, &quot;sub {}&quot;, and &quot;do {}&quot; that
<i>look</i> like compound statements, but
aren&rsquo;t--they&rsquo;re just TERMs in an expression--and
thus need an explicit termination when used as the last item
in a statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Statement
Modifiers</b> <br>
Any simple statement may optionally be followed by a
<i><small>SINGLE</small></i> modifier, just before the
terminating semicolon (or block ending). The possible
modifiers are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if EXPR <br>
unless EXPR <br>
while EXPR <br>
until EXPR <br>
for LIST <br>
foreach LIST <br>
when EXPR</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;EXPR&quot; following the modifier is referred to as
the &quot;condition&quot;. Its truth or falsehood determines
how the modifier will behave.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;if&quot;
executes the statement once <i>if</i> and only if the
condition is true. &quot;unless&quot; is the opposite, it
executes the statement <i>unless</i> the condition is true
(that is, if the condition is false). See &quot;Scalar
values&quot; in perldata for definitions of true and
false.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print
&quot;Basset hounds got long ears&quot; if length $ear &gt;=
10; <br>
go_outside() and play() unless $is_raining;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;for(each)&quot; modifier is an iterator: it executes
the statement once for each item in the <small>LIST</small>
(with $_ aliased to each item in turn). There is no syntax
to specify a C&minus;style for loop or a lexically scoped
iteration variable in this form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print
&quot;Hello $_!\n&quot; for qw(world Dolly nurse);</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;while&quot;
repeats the statement <i>while</i> the condition is true.
Postfix &quot;while&quot; has the same magic treatment of
some kinds of condition that prefix &quot;while&quot; has.
&quot;until&quot; does the opposite, it repeats the
statement <i>until</i> the condition is true (or while the
condition is false):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># Both of these
count from 0 to 10. <br>
print $i++ while $i &lt;= 10; <br>
print $j++ until $j &gt; 10;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;while&quot; and &quot;until&quot; modifiers have the
usual &quot;&quot;while&quot; loop&quot; semantics
(conditional evaluated first), except when applied to a
&quot;do&quot;&minus;BLOCK (or to the Perl4
&quot;do&quot;&minus;SUBROUTINE statement), in which case
the block executes once before the conditional is
evaluated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is so that
you can write loops like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">do { <br>
$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;; <br>
... <br>
} until !defined($line) || $line eq &quot;.\n&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;do&quot; in perlfunc. Note also that the loop control
statements described later will <i><small>NOT</small></i>
work in this construct, because modifiers don&rsquo;t take
loop labels. Sorry. You can always put another block inside
of it (for &quot;next&quot;/&quot;redo&quot;) or around it
(for &quot;last&quot;) to do that sort of thing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
&quot;next&quot; or &quot;redo&quot;, just double the
braces:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">do {{ <br>
next if $x == $y; <br>
# do something here <br>
}} until $x++ &gt; $z;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
&quot;last&quot;, you have to be more elaborate and put
braces around it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
do { <br>
last if $x == $y**2; <br>
# do something here <br>
} while $x++ &lt;= $z; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you need
both &quot;next&quot; and &quot;last&quot;, you have to do
both and also use a loop label:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LOOP: { <br>
do {{ <br>
next if $x == $y; <br>
last LOOP if $x == $y**2; <br>
# do something here <br>
}} until $x++ &gt; $z; <br>
}</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>NOTE:</small></b>
The behaviour of a &quot;my&quot;, &quot;state&quot;, or
&quot;our&quot; modified with a statement modifier
conditional or loop construct (for example, &quot;my $x if
...&quot;) is <b>undefined</b>. The value of the
&quot;my&quot; variable may be &quot;undef&quot;, any
previously assigned value, or possibly anything else.
Don&rsquo;t rely on it. Future versions of perl might do
something different from the version of perl you try it out
on. Here be dragons.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;when&quot; modifier is an experimental feature that
first appeared in Perl 5.14. To use it, you should include a
&quot;use v5.14&quot; declaration. (Technically, it requires
only the &quot;switch&quot; feature, but that aspect of it
was not available before 5.14.) Operative only from within a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop or a &quot;given&quot; block, it
executes the statement only if the smartmatch &quot;$_ ~~
<i>EXPR</i>&quot; is true. If the statement executes, it is
followed by a &quot;next&quot; from inside a
&quot;foreach&quot; and &quot;break&quot; from inside a
&quot;given&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under the
current implementation, the &quot;foreach&quot; loop can be
anywhere within the &quot;when&quot; modifier&rsquo;s
dynamic scope, but must be within the &quot;given&quot;
block&rsquo;s lexical scope. This restriction may be relaxed
in a future release. See &quot;Switch Statements&quot;
below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compound
Statements</b> <br>
In Perl, a sequence of statements that defines a scope is
called a block. Sometimes a block is delimited by the file
containing it (in the case of a required file, or the
program as a whole), and sometimes a block is delimited by
the extent of a string (in the case of an eval).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But generally,
a block is delimited by curly brackets, also known as
braces. We will call this syntactic construct a
<small>BLOCK.</small> Because enclosing braces are also the
syntax for hash reference constructor expressions (see
perlref), you may occasionally need to disambiguate by
placing a &quot;;&quot; immediately after an opening brace
so that Perl realises the brace is the start of a block. You
will more frequently need to disambiguate the other way, by
placing a &quot;+&quot; immediately before an opening brace
to force it to be interpreted as a hash reference
constructor expression. It is considered good style to use
these disambiguating mechanisms liberally, not only when
Perl would otherwise guess incorrectly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
compound statements may be used to control flow:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if (EXPR) BLOCK
<br>
if (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK <br>
if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... <br>
if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK <br>
unless (EXPR) BLOCK <br>
unless (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK <br>
unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... <br>
unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK <br>
given (EXPR) BLOCK <br>
LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK <br>
LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK <br>
LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK <br>
LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK <br>
LABEL for (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK <br>
LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK <br>
LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK <br>
LABEL foreach (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK <br>
LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK <br>
LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK <br>
LABEL BLOCK <br>
LABEL BLOCK continue BLOCK <br>
PHASE BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.36, you can iterate over multiple values at a time by
specifying a list of lexicals within parentheses:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">no warnings
&quot;experimental::for_list&quot;; <br>
LABEL for my (VAR, VAR) (LIST) BLOCK <br>
LABEL for my (VAR, VAR) (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK <br>
LABEL foreach my (VAR, VAR) (LIST) BLOCK <br>
LABEL foreach my (VAR, VAR) (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If enabled by
the experimental &quot;try&quot; feature, the following may
also be used</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">try BLOCK catch
(VAR) BLOCK <br>
try BLOCK catch (VAR) BLOCK finally BLOCK</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
experimental &quot;given&quot; statement is <i>not
automatically enabled</i>; see &quot;Switch Statements&quot;
below for how to do so, and the attendant caveats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike in C and
Pascal, in Perl these are all defined in terms of BLOCKs,
not statements. This means that the curly brackets are
<i>required</i>&minus;&minus;no dangling statements allowed.
If you want to write conditionals without curly brackets,
there are several other ways to do it. The following all do
the same thing:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if (!open(FOO))
{ die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot; } <br>
die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot; unless open(FOO); <br>
open(FOO) || die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot;; <br>
open(FOO) ? () : die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot;; <br>
# a bit exotic, that last one</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;if&quot; statement is straightforward. Because BLOCKs
are always bounded by curly brackets, there is never any
ambiguity about which &quot;if&quot; an &quot;else&quot;
goes with. If you use &quot;unless&quot; in place of
&quot;if&quot;, the sense of the test is reversed. Like
&quot;if&quot;, &quot;unless&quot; can be followed by
&quot;else&quot;. &quot;unless&quot; can even be followed by
one or more &quot;elsif&quot; statements, though you may
want to think twice before using that particular language
construct, as everyone reading your code will have to think
at least twice before they can understand what&rsquo;s going
on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;while&quot; statement executes the block as long as
the expression is true. The &quot;until&quot; statement
executes the block as long as the expression is false. The
<small>LABEL</small> is optional, and if present, consists
of an identifier followed by a colon. The
<small>LABEL</small> identifies the loop for the loop
control statements &quot;next&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, and
&quot;redo&quot;. If the <small>LABEL</small> is omitted,
the loop control statement refers to the innermost enclosing
loop. This may include dynamically searching through your
call-stack at run time to find the <small>LABEL.</small>
Such desperate behavior triggers a warning if you use the
&quot;use warnings&quot; pragma or the <b>&minus;w</b>
flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
condition expression of a &quot;while&quot; statement is
based on any of a group of iterative expression types then
it gets some magic treatment. The affected iterative
expression types are &quot;readline&quot;, the
&quot;&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt;&quot; input operator,
&quot;readdir&quot;, &quot;glob&quot;, the
&quot;&lt;PATTERN&gt;&quot; globbing operator, and
&quot;each&quot;. If the condition expression is one of
these expression types, then the value yielded by the
iterative operator will be implicitly assigned to $_. If the
condition expression is one of these expression types or an
explicit assignment of one of them to a scalar, then the
condition actually tests for definedness of the
expression&rsquo;s value, not for its regular truth
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If there is a
&quot;continue&quot; <small>BLOCK,</small> it is always
executed just before the conditional is about to be
evaluated again. Thus it can be used to increment a loop
variable, even when the loop has been continued via the
&quot;next&quot; statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a block is
preceded by a compilation phase keyword such as
&quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;END&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot;,
&quot;CHECK&quot;, or &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, then the block
will run only during the corresponding phase of execution.
See perlmod for more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Extension
modules can also hook into the Perl parser to define new
kinds of compound statements. These are introduced by a
keyword which the extension recognizes, and the syntax
following the keyword is defined entirely by the extension.
If you are an implementor, see &quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot;
in perlapi for the mechanism. If you are using such a
module, see the module&rsquo;s documentation for details of
the syntax that it defines.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Loop
Control</b> <br>
The &quot;next&quot; command starts the next iteration of
the loop:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LINE: while
(&lt;STDIN&gt;) { <br>
next LINE if /^#/; # discard comments <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;last&quot; command immediately exits the loop in
question. The &quot;continue&quot; block, if any, is not
executed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LINE: while
(&lt;STDIN&gt;) { <br>
last LINE if /^$/; # exit when done with header <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;redo&quot; command restarts the loop block without
evaluating the conditional again. The &quot;continue&quot;
block, if any, is <i>not</i> executed. This command is
normally used by programs that want to lie to themselves
about what was just input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
when processing a file like <i>/etc/termcap</i>. If your
input lines might end in backslashes to indicate
continuation, you want to skip ahead and get the next
record.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">while
(&lt;&gt;) { <br>
chomp; <br>
if (s/\\$//) { <br>
$_ .= &lt;&gt;; <br>
redo unless eof(); <br>
} <br>
# now process $_ <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">which is Perl
shorthand for the more explicitly written version:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">LINE: while
(defined($line = &lt;ARGV&gt;)) { <br>
chomp($line); <br>
if ($line =~ s/\\$//) { <br>
$line .= &lt;ARGV&gt;; <br>
redo LINE unless eof(); # not eof(ARGV)! <br>
} <br>
# now process $line <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
there were a &quot;continue&quot; block on the above code,
it would get executed only on lines discarded by the regex
(since redo skips the continue block). A continue block is
often used to reset line counters or &quot;m?pat?&quot;
one-time matches:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># inspired by
:1,$g/fred/s//WILMA/ <br>
while (&lt;&gt;) { <br>
m?(fred)? &amp;&amp; s//WILMA $1 WILMA/; <br>
m?(barney)? &amp;&amp; s//BETTY $1 BETTY/; <br>
m?(homer)? &amp;&amp; s//MARGE $1 MARGE/; <br>
} continue { <br>
print &quot;$ARGV $.: $_&quot;; <br>
close ARGV if eof; # reset $. <br>
reset if eof; # reset ?pat? <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the word
&quot;while&quot; is replaced by the word &quot;until&quot;,
the sense of the test is reversed, but the conditional is
still tested before the first iteration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Loop control
statements don&rsquo;t work in an &quot;if&quot; or
&quot;unless&quot;, since they aren&rsquo;t loops. You can
double the braces to make them such, though.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if (/pattern/)
{{ <br>
last if /fred/; <br>
next if /barney/; # same effect as &quot;last&quot;, <br>
# but doesn't document as well <br>
# do something here <br>
}}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is caused
by the fact that a block by itself acts as a loop that
executes once, see &quot;Basic BLOCKs&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The form
&quot;while/if BLOCK BLOCK&quot;, available in Perl 4, is no
longer available. Replace any occurrence of &quot;if
BLOCK&quot; by &quot;if (do BLOCK)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>For
Loops</b> <br>
Perl&rsquo;s C&minus;style &quot;for&quot; loop works like
the corresponding &quot;while&quot; loop; that means that
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for ($i = 1; $i
&lt; 10; $i++) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is the same as
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$i = 1; <br>
while ($i &lt; 10) { <br>
... <br>
} continue { <br>
$i++; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is one
minor difference: if variables are declared with
&quot;my&quot; in the initialization section of the
&quot;for&quot;, the lexical scope of those variables is
exactly the &quot;for&quot; loop (the body of the loop and
the control sections). To illustrate:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $i =
'samba'; <br>
for (my $i = 1; $i &lt;= 4; $i++) { <br>
print &quot;$i\n&quot;; <br>
} <br>
print &quot;$i\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Foreach
Loops</b> <br>
The &quot;foreach&quot; loop iterates over a normal list
value and sets the scalar variable <small>VAR</small> to be
each element of the list in turn. If the variable is
preceded with the keyword &quot;my&quot;, then it is
lexically scoped, and is therefore visible only within the
loop. Otherwise, the variable is implicitly local to the
loop and regains its former value upon exiting the loop. If
the variable was previously declared with &quot;my&quot;, it
uses that variable instead of the global one, but it&rsquo;s
still localized to the loop. This implicit localization
occurs <i>only</i> for non C&minus;style loops.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;foreach&quot; keyword is actually a synonym for the
&quot;for&quot; keyword, so you can use either. If
<small>VAR</small> is omitted, $_ is set to each value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If any element
of <small>LIST</small> is an lvalue, you can modify it by
modifying <small>VAR</small> inside the loop. Conversely, if
any element of <small>LIST</small> is <small>NOT</small> an
lvalue, any attempt to modify that element will fail. In
other words, the &quot;foreach&quot; loop index variable is
an implicit alias for each item in the list that
you&rsquo;re looping over.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If any part of
<small>LIST</small> is an array, &quot;foreach&quot; will
get very confused if you add or remove elements within the
loop body, for example with &quot;splice&quot;. So
don&rsquo;t do that.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;foreach&quot;
probably won&rsquo;t do what you expect if
<small>VAR</small> is a tied or other special variable.
Don&rsquo;t do that either.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.22, there is an experimental variant of this loop that
accepts a variable preceded by a backslash for
<small>VAR,</small> in which case the items in the
<small>LIST</small> must be references. The backslashed
variable will become an alias to each referenced item in the
<small>LIST,</small> which must be of the correct type. The
variable needn&rsquo;t be a scalar in this case, and the
backslash may be followed by &quot;my&quot;. To use this
form, you must enable the &quot;refaliasing&quot; feature
via &quot;use feature&quot;. (See feature. See also
&quot;Assigning to References&quot; in perlref.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.36, you can iterate over multiple values at a time. You
can only iterate with lexical scalars as the iterator
variables &minus; unlike list assignment, it&rsquo;s not
possible to use &quot;undef&quot; to signify a value that
isn&rsquo;t wanted. This is a limitation of the current
implementation, and might be changed in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the size of
the <small>LIST</small> is not an exact multiple of the
number of iterator variables, then on the last iteration the
&quot;excess&quot; iterator variables are aliases to
&quot;undef&quot;, as if the <small>LIST</small> had &quot;,
undef&quot; appended as many times as needed for its length
to become an exact multiple. This happens whether
<small>LIST</small> is a literal <small>LIST</small> or an
array &minus; ie arrays are not extended if their size is
not a multiple of the iteration size, consistent with
iterating an array one-at-a-time. As these padding elements
are not lvalues, attempting to modify them will fail,
consistent with the behaviour when iterating a list with
literal &quot;undef&quot;s. If this is not the behaviour you
desire, then before the loop starts either explicitly extend
your array to be an exact multiple, or explicitly throw an
exception.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for (@ary) {

}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
how a C programmer might code up a particular algorithm in
Perl:</p>

} <br>
$ary1[$i] += $ary2[$j]; <br>
} <br>
# this is where that last takes me <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whereas
here&rsquo;s how a Perl programmer more comfortable with the
idiom might do it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OUTER: for my
$wid (@ary1) { <br>
INNER: for my $jet (@ary2) { <br>
next OUTER if $wid &gt; $jet; <br>
$wid += $jet; <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See how much
easier this is? It&rsquo;s cleaner, safer, and faster.
It&rsquo;s cleaner because it&rsquo;s less noisy. It&rsquo;s
safer because if code gets added between the inner and outer
loops later on, the new code won&rsquo;t be accidentally
executed. The &quot;next&quot; explicitly iterates the other
loop rather than merely terminating the inner one. And
it&rsquo;s faster because Perl executes a
&quot;foreach&quot; statement more rapidly than it would the
equivalent C&minus;style &quot;for&quot; loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perceptive Perl
hackers may have noticed that a &quot;for&quot; loop has a
return value, and that this value can be captured by
wrapping the loop in a &quot;do&quot; block. The reward for
this discovery is this cautionary advice: The return value
of a &quot;for&quot; loop is unspecified and may change
without notice. Do not rely on it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Try Catch
Exception Handling</b> <br>
The &quot;try&quot;/&quot;catch&quot; syntax provides
control flow relating to exception handling. The
&quot;try&quot; keyword introduces a block which will be
executed when it is encountered, and the &quot;catch&quot;
block provides code to handle any exception that may be
thrown by the first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">try { <br>
my $x = call_a_function(); <br>
$x &lt; 100 or die &quot;Too big&quot;; <br>
send_output($x); <br>
} <br>
catch ($e) { <br>
warn &quot;Unable to output a value; $e&quot;; <br>
} <br>
print &quot;Finished\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here, the body
of the &quot;catch&quot; block (i.e. the &quot;warn&quot;
statement) will be executed if the initial block invokes the
conditional &quot;die&quot;, or if either of the functions
it invokes throws an uncaught exception. The
&quot;catch&quot; block can inspect the $e lexical variable
in this case to see what the exception was. If no exception
was thrown then the &quot;catch&quot; block does not happen.
In either case, execution will then continue from the
following statement &minus; in this example the
&quot;print&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;catch&quot; keyword must be immediately followed by a
variable declaration in parentheses, which introduces a new
variable visible to the body of the subsequent block. Inside
the block this variable will contain the exception value
that was thrown by the code in the &quot;try&quot; block. It
is not necessary to use the &quot;my&quot; keyword to
declare this variable; this is implied (similar as it is for
subroutine signatures).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both the
&quot;try&quot; and the &quot;catch&quot; blocks are
permitted to contain control-flow expressions, such as
&quot;return&quot;, &quot;goto&quot;, or
&quot;next&quot;/&quot;last&quot;/&quot;redo&quot;. In all
cases they behave as expected without warnings. In
particular, a &quot;return&quot; expression inside the
&quot;try&quot; block will make its entire containing
function return &minus; this is in contrast to its behaviour
inside an &quot;eval&quot; block, where it would only make
that block return.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Like other
control-flow syntax, &quot;try&quot; and &quot;catch&quot;
will yield the last evaluated value when placed as the final
statement in a function or a &quot;do&quot; block. This
permits the syntax to be used to create a value. In this
case remember not to use the &quot;return&quot; expression,
or that will cause the containing function to return.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $value = do
{ <br>
try { <br>
get_thing(@args); <br>
} <br>
catch ($e) { <br>
warn &quot;Unable to get thing &minus; $e&quot;; <br>
$DEFAULT_THING; <br>
} <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As with other
control-flow syntax, &quot;try&quot; blocks are not visible
to &quot;caller()&quot; (just as for example,
&quot;while&quot; or &quot;foreach&quot; loops are not).
Successive levels of the &quot;caller&quot; result can see
subroutine calls and &quot;eval&quot; blocks, because those
affect the way that &quot;return&quot; would work. Since
&quot;try&quot; blocks do not intercept &quot;return&quot;,
they are not of interest to &quot;caller&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;try&quot; and &quot;catch&quot; blocks may optionally
be followed by a third block introduced by the
&quot;finally&quot; keyword. This third block is executed
after the rest of the construct has finished.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">try { <br>
call_a_function(); <br>
} <br>
catch ($e) { <br>
warn &quot;Unable to call; $e&quot;; <br>
} <br>
finally { <br>
print &quot;Finished\n&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;finally&quot; block is equivalent to using a
&quot;defer&quot; block and will be invoked in the same
situations; whether the &quot;try&quot; block completes
successfully, throws an exception, or transfers control
elsewhere by using &quot;return&quot;, a loop control, or
&quot;goto&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike the
&quot;try&quot; and &quot;catch&quot; blocks, a
&quot;finally&quot; block is not permitted to
&quot;return&quot;, &quot;goto&quot; or use any loop
controls. The final expression value is ignored, and does
not affect the return value of the containing function even
if it is placed last in the function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This syntax is
currently experimental and must be enabled with &quot;use
feature 'try'&quot;. It emits a warning in the
&quot;experimental::try&quot; category.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Basic
BLOCKs</b> <br>
A <small>BLOCK</small> by itself (labeled or not) is
semantically equivalent to a loop that executes once. Thus
you can use any of the loop control statements in it to
leave or restart the block. (Note that this is
<i><small>NOT</small></i> true in &quot;eval{}&quot;,
&quot;sub{}&quot;, or contrary to popular belief
&quot;do{}&quot; blocks, which do <i><small>NOT</small></i>
count as loops.) The &quot;continue&quot; block is
optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>BLOCK</small> construct can be used to emulate case
structures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SWITCH: { <br>
if (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
$nothing = 1; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You&rsquo;ll
also find that &quot;foreach&quot; loop used to create a
topicalizer and a switch:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SWITCH: <br>

if (/^def/) { $def = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
if (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; last SWITCH; } <br>
$nothing = 1; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Such constructs
are quite frequently used, both because older versions of
Perl had no official &quot;switch&quot; statement, and also
because the new version described immediately below remains
experimental and can sometimes be confusing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>defer
blocks</b> <br>
A block prefixed by the &quot;defer&quot; modifier provides
a section of code which runs at a later time during scope
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;defer&quot; block can appear at any point where a
regular block or other statement is permitted. If the flow
of execution reaches this statement, the body of the block
is stored for later, but not invoked immediately. When the
flow of control leaves the containing block for any reason,
this stored block is executed on the way past. It provides a
means of deferring execution until a later time. This acts
similarly to syntax provided by some other languages, often
using keywords named &quot;try / finally&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This syntax is
available if enabled by the &quot;defer&quot; named feature,
and is currently experimental. If experimental warnings are
enabled it will emit a warning when used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use feature
'defer'; <br>
{ <br>
say &quot;This happens first&quot;; <br>
defer { say &quot;This happens last&quot;; } <br>
say &quot;And this happens inbetween&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If multiple
&quot;defer&quot; blocks are contained in a single scope,
they are executed in <small>LIFO</small> order; the last one
reached is the first one executed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The code stored
by the &quot;defer&quot; block will be invoked when control
leaves its containing block due to regular fallthrough,
explicit &quot;return&quot;, exceptions thrown by
&quot;die&quot; or propagated by functions called by it,
&quot;goto&quot;, or any of the loop control statements
&quot;next&quot;, &quot;last&quot; or &quot;redo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the flow of
control does not reach the &quot;defer&quot; statement
itself then its body is not stored for later execution.
(This is in direct contrast to the code provided by an
&quot;END&quot; phaser block, which is always enqueued by
the compiler, regardless of whether execution ever reached
the line it was given on.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use feature
'defer'; <br>
{ <br>
defer { say &quot;This will run&quot;; } <br>
return; <br>
defer { say &quot;This will not&quot;; } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Exceptions
thrown by code inside a &quot;defer&quot; block will
propagate to the caller in the same way as any other
exception thrown by normal code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
&quot;defer&quot; block is being executed due to a thrown
exception and throws another one it is not specified what
happens, beyond that the caller will definitely receive an
exception.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Besides
throwing an exception, a &quot;defer&quot; block is not
permitted to otherwise alter the control flow of its
surrounding code. In particular, it may not cause its
containing function to &quot;return&quot;, nor may it
&quot;goto&quot; a label, or control a containing loop using
&quot;next&quot;, &quot;last&quot; or &quot;redo&quot;.
These constructions are however, permitted entirely within
the body of the &quot;defer&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use feature

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Switch
Statements</b> <br>
Starting from Perl 5.10.1 (well, 5.10.0, but it didn&rsquo;t
work right), you can say</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use feature
&quot;switch&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to enable an
experimental switch feature. This is loosely based on an old
version of a Raku proposal, but it no longer resembles the
Raku construct. You also get the switch feature whenever you
declare that your code prefers to run under a version of
Perl between 5.10 and 5.34. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.14;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under the
&quot;switch&quot; feature, Perl gains the experimental
keywords &quot;given&quot;, &quot;when&quot;,
&quot;default&quot;, &quot;continue&quot;, and
&quot;break&quot;. Starting from Perl 5.16, one can prefix
the switch keywords with &quot;CORE::&quot; to access the
feature without a &quot;use feature&quot; statement. The
keywords &quot;given&quot; and &quot;when&quot; are
analogous to &quot;switch&quot; and &quot;case&quot; in
other languages -- though &quot;continue&quot; is not -- so
the code in the previous section could be rewritten as</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.10.1;
<br>
for ($var) { <br>
when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1 } <br>
when (/^def/) { $def = 1 } <br>
when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1 } <br>
default { $nothing = 1 } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;foreach&quot; is the non-experimental way to set a
topicalizer. If you wish to use the highly experimental
&quot;given&quot;, that could be written like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.10.1;
<br>
given ($var) { <br>
when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1 } <br>
when (/^def/) { $def = 1 } <br>
when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1 } <br>
default { $nothing = 1 } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of 5.14,
that can also be written this way:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.14; <br>
for ($var) { <br>
$abc = 1 when /^abc/; <br>
$def = 1 when /^def/; <br>
$xyz = 1 when /^xyz/; <br>
default { $nothing = 1 } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or if you
don&rsquo;t care to play it safe, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.14; <br>
given ($var) { <br>
$abc = 1 when /^abc/; <br>
$def = 1 when /^def/; <br>
$xyz = 1 when /^xyz/; <br>
default { $nothing = 1 } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The arguments
to &quot;given&quot; and &quot;when&quot; are in scalar
context, and &quot;given&quot; assigns the $_ variable its
topic value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Exactly what
the <i><small>EXPR</small></i> argument to &quot;when&quot;
does is hard to describe precisely, but in general, it tries
to guess what you want done. Sometimes it is interpreted as
&quot;$_ ~~ <i>EXPR</i>&quot;, and sometimes it is not. It
also behaves differently when lexically enclosed by a
&quot;given&quot; block than it does when dynamically
enclosed by a &quot;foreach&quot; loop. The rules are far
too difficult to understand to be described here. See
&quot;Experimental Details on given and when&quot; later
on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Due to an
unfortunate bug in how &quot;given&quot; was implemented
between Perl 5.10 and 5.16, under those implementations the
version of $_ governed by &quot;given&quot; is merely a
lexically scoped copy of the original, not a dynamically
scoped alias to the original, as it would be if it were a
&quot;foreach&quot; or under both the original and the
current Raku language specification. This bug was fixed in
Perl 5.18 (and lexicalized $_ itself was removed in Perl
5.24).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your code
still needs to run on older versions, stick to
&quot;foreach&quot; for your topicalizer and you will be
less unhappy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Goto</b>
<br>
Although not for the faint of heart, Perl does support a
&quot;goto&quot; statement. There are three forms:
&quot;goto&quot;&minus;LABEL, &quot;goto&quot;&minus;EXPR,
and &quot;goto&quot;&minus;&amp;NAME. A loop&rsquo;s
<small>LABEL</small> is not actually a valid target for a
&quot;goto&quot;; it&rsquo;s just the name of the loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;goto&quot;&minus;LABEL form finds the statement
labeled with <small>LABEL</small> and resumes execution
there. It may not be used to go into any construct that
requires initialization, such as a subroutine or a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop. It also can&rsquo;t be used to go
into a construct that is optimized away. It can be used to
go almost anywhere else within the dynamic scope, including
out of subroutines, but it&rsquo;s usually better to use
some other construct such as &quot;last&quot; or
&quot;die&quot;. The author of Perl has never felt the need
to use this form of &quot;goto&quot; (in Perl, that is--C is
another matter).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;goto&quot;&minus;EXPR form expects a label name, whose
scope will be resolved dynamically. This allows for computed
&quot;goto&quot;s per <small>FORTRAN,</small> but
isn&rsquo;t necessarily recommended if you&rsquo;re
optimizing for maintainability:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">goto((&quot;FOO&quot;,
&quot;BAR&quot;, &quot;GLARCH&quot;)[$i]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;goto&quot;&minus;&amp;NAME form is highly magical, and
substitutes a call to the named subroutine for the currently
running subroutine. This is used by &quot;AUTOLOAD()&quot;
subroutines that wish to load another subroutine and then
pretend that the other subroutine had been called in the
first place (except that any modifications to @_ in the
current subroutine are propagated to the other subroutine.)
After the &quot;goto&quot;, not even &quot;caller()&quot;
will be able to tell that this routine was called first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In almost all
cases like this, it&rsquo;s usually a far, far better idea
to use the structured control flow mechanisms of
&quot;next&quot;, &quot;last&quot;, or &quot;redo&quot;
instead of resorting to a &quot;goto&quot;. For certain
applications, the catch and throw pair of &quot;eval{}&quot;
and <b>die()</b> for exception processing can also be a
prudent approach.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The Ellipsis
Statement</b> <br>
Beginning in Perl 5.12, Perl accepts an ellipsis,
&quot;&quot;...&quot;&quot;, as a placeholder for code that
you haven&rsquo;t implemented yet. When Perl 5.12 or later
encounters an ellipsis statement, it parses this without
error, but if and when you should actually try to execute
it, Perl throws an exception with the text
&quot;Unimplemented&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.12; <br>
sub unimplemented { ... } <br>
eval { unimplemented() }; <br>
if ($@ =~ /^Unimplemented at /) { <br>
say &quot;I found an ellipsis!&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can only
use the elliptical statement to stand in for a complete
statement. Syntactically, &quot;&quot;...;&quot;&quot; is a
complete statement, but, as with other kinds of
semicolon-terminated statement, the semicolon may be omitted
if &quot;&quot;...&quot;&quot; appears immediately before a
closing brace. These examples show how the ellipsis
works:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.12; <br>
{ ... } <br>
sub foo { ... } <br>
...; <br>
eval { ... }; <br>
sub somemeth { <br>
my $self = shift; <br>
...; <br>
} <br>
$x = do { <br>
my $n; <br>
...; <br>
say &quot;Hurrah!&quot;; <br>
$n; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The elliptical
statement cannot stand in for an expression that is part of
a larger statement. These examples of attempts to use an
ellipsis are syntax errors:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.12; <br>
print ...; <br>
open(my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;/dev/passwd&quot;) or
...; <br>
if ($condition &amp;&amp; ... ) { say &quot;Howdy&quot; };
<br>
... if $a &gt; $b; <br>
say &quot;Cromulent&quot; if ...; <br>
$flub = 5 + ...;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are some
cases where Perl can&rsquo;t immediately tell the difference
between an expression and a statement. For instance, the
syntax for a block and an anonymous hash reference
constructor look the same unless there&rsquo;s something in
the braces to give Perl a hint. The ellipsis is a syntax
error if Perl doesn&rsquo;t guess that the &quot;{ ...
}&quot; is a block. Inside your block, you can use a
&quot;;&quot; before the ellipsis to denote that the &quot;{
... }&quot; is a block and not a hash reference
constructor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: Some
folks colloquially refer to this bit of punctuation as a
&quot;yada-yada&quot; or &quot;triple-dot&quot;, but its
true name is actually an ellipsis.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PODs:
Embedded Documentation</b> <br>
Perl has a mechanism for intermixing documentation with
source code. While it&rsquo;s expecting the beginning of a
new statement, if the compiler encounters a line that begins
with an equal sign and a word, like this</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">=head1 Here
There Be Pods!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then that text
and all remaining text up through and including a line
beginning with &quot;=cut&quot; will be ignored. The format
of the intervening text is described in perlpod.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This allows you
to intermix your source code and your documentation text
freely, as in</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">=item
snazzle($) <br>
The snazzle() function will behave in the most spectacular
<br>
form that you can possibly imagine, not even excepting <br>
cybernetic pyrotechnics. <br>
=cut back to the compiler, nuff of this pod stuff! <br>
sub snazzle($) { <br>
my $thingie = shift; <br>
......... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that pod
translators should look at only paragraphs beginning with a
pod directive (it makes parsing easier), whereas the
compiler actually knows to look for pod escapes even in the
middle of a paragraph. This means that the following secret
stuff will be ignored by both the compiler and the
translators.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$a=3; <br>
=secret stuff <br>
warn &quot;Neither POD nor CODE!?&quot; <br>
=cut back <br>
print &quot;got $a\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You probably
shouldn&rsquo;t rely upon the &quot;warn()&quot; being
podded out forever. Not all pod translators are well-behaved
in this regard, and perhaps the compiler will become
pickier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One may also
use pod directives to quickly comment out a section of
code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Plain Old
Comments (Not!)</b> <br>
Perl can process line directives, much like the C
preprocessor. Using this, one can control Perl&rsquo;s idea
of filenames and line numbers in error or warning messages
(especially for strings that are processed with
&quot;eval()&quot;). The syntax for this mechanism is almost
the same as for most C preprocessors: it matches the regular
expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># example: '#
line 42 &quot;new_filename.plx&quot;' <br>
/^\# \s* <br>
line \s+ (\d+) \s* <br>
(?:\s(&quot;?)([^&quot;]+)\g2)? \s* <br>
$/x</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">with $1 being
the line number for the next line, and $3 being the optional
filename (specified with or without quotes). Note that no
whitespace may precede the &quot;#&quot;, unlike modern C
preprocessors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
fairly obvious gotcha included with the line directive:
Debuggers and profilers will only show the last source line
to appear at a particular line number in a given file. Care
should be taken not to cause line number collisions in code
you&rsquo;d like to debug later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
examples that you should be able to type into your command
shell:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">% perl <br>
# line 200 &quot;bzzzt&quot; <br>
# the '#' on the previous line must be the first char on
line <br>

foo at bzzzt line 201. <br>
% perl <br>
# line 200 &quot;bzzzt&quot; <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Experimental
Details on given and when</b> <br>
As previously mentioned, the &quot;switch&quot; feature is
considered highly experimental; it is subject to change with
little notice. In particular, &quot;when&quot; has tricky
behaviours that are expected to change to become less tricky
in the future. Do not rely upon its current
(mis)implementation. Before Perl 5.18, &quot;given&quot;
also had tricky behaviours that you should still beware of
if your code must run on older versions of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is a
longer example of &quot;given&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use feature
&quot;:5.10&quot;; <br>
given ($foo) { <br>
when (undef) { <br>
say '$foo is undefined'; <br>
} <br>
when (&quot;foo&quot;) { <br>
say '$foo is the string &quot;foo&quot;'; <br>
} <br>
when ([1,3,5,7,9]) { <br>
say '$foo is an odd digit'; <br>
continue; # Fall through <br>
} <br>
when ($_ &lt; 100) { <br>
say '$foo is numerically less than 100'; <br>
} <br>
when (\&amp;complicated_check) { <br>
say 'a complicated check for $foo is true'; <br>
} <br>
default { <br>
die q(I don't know what to do with $foo); <br>
} <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Perl
5.18, &quot;given(EXPR)&quot; assigned the value of
<i><small>EXPR</small></i> to merely a lexically scoped
<b><i>copy</i></b> (!) of $_, not a dynamically scoped alias
the way &quot;foreach&quot; does. That made it similar
to</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">do { my $_ =
EXPR; ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">except that the
block was automatically broken out of by a successful
&quot;when&quot; or an explicit &quot;break&quot;. Because
it was only a copy, and because it was only lexically
scoped, not dynamically scoped, you could not do the things
with it that you are used to in a &quot;foreach&quot; loop.
In particular, it did not work for arbitrary function calls
if those functions might try to access $_. Best stick to
&quot;foreach&quot; for that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most of the
power comes from the implicit smartmatching that can
sometimes apply. Most of the time, &quot;when(EXPR)&quot; is
treated as an implicit smartmatch of $_, that is, &quot;$_
~~ EXPR&quot;. (See &quot;Smartmatch Operator&quot; in
perlop for more information on smartmatching.) But when
<i><small>EXPR</small></i> is one of the 10 exceptional

Perl inspects the operands of logical operators to decide

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These rules are
complicated, but the goal is for them to do what you want
(even if you don&rsquo;t quite understand why they are doing
it). For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">when (/^\d+$/
&amp;&amp; $_ &lt; 75) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will be treated
as a boolean match because the rules say both a regex match
and an explicit test on $_ will be treated as boolean.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">when ([qw(foo
bar)] &amp;&amp; /baz/) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will use
smartmatching because only <i>one</i> of the operands is a
boolean: the other uses smartmatching, and that wins.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Further:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">when ([qw(foo
bar)] || /^baz/) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will use smart
matching (only the first operand is considered), whereas</p>

[qw(foo bar)]) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will test only
the regex, which causes both operands to be treated as
boolean. Watch out for this one, then, because an arrayref
is always a true value, which makes it effectively
redundant. Not a good idea.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tautologous
boolean operators are still going to be optimized away.
Don&rsquo;t be tempted to write</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will
optimize down to &quot;foo&quot;, so &quot;bar&quot; will
never be considered (even though the rules say to use a

this, an array ref will work, because this will instigate
smartmatching:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another useful
shortcut is that, if you use a literal array or hash as the

way to count how many times a particular string occurs in an

my $count = 0; <br>

for (@array) { <br>
++$count when &quot;foo&quot;; <br>

print &quot;\@array contains $count copies of
'foo'\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the end of
all &quot;when&quot; blocks, there is an implicit
&quot;next&quot;. You can override that with an explicit
&quot;last&quot; if you&rsquo;re interested in only the
first match alone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This
doesn&rsquo;t work if you explicitly specify a loop
variable, as in &quot;for $item (@array)&quot;. You have to
use the default variable $_.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Differences
from Raku</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl 5
smartmatch and &quot;given&quot;/&quot;when&quot; constructs
are not compatible with their Raku analogues. The most
visible difference and least important difference is that,
in Perl 5, parentheses are required around the argument to
&quot;given()&quot; and &quot;when()&quot; (except when this
last one is used as a statement modifier). Parentheses in
Raku are always optional in a control construct such as
&quot;if()&quot;, &quot;while()&quot;, or
&quot;when()&quot;; they can&rsquo;t be made optional in
Perl 5 without a great deal of potential confusion, because
Perl 5 would parse the expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">given $foo {
<br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">as though the
argument to &quot;given&quot; were an element of the hash
%foo, interpreting the braces as hash-element syntax.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, their
are many, many other differences. For example, this works in
Perl 5:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.12; <br>
my @primary = (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;,
&quot;green&quot;); <br>
if (@primary ~~ &quot;red&quot;) { <br>
say &quot;primary smartmatches red&quot;; <br>
} <br>
if (&quot;red&quot; ~~ @primary) { <br>
say &quot;red smartmatches primary&quot;; <br>
} <br>
say &quot;that's all, folks!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But it
doesn&rsquo;t work at all in Raku. Instead, you should use
the (parallelizable) &quot;any&quot; operator:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if
any(@primary) eq &quot;red&quot; { <br>
say &quot;primary smartmatches red&quot;; <br>
} <br>
if &quot;red&quot; eq any(@primary) { <br>
say &quot;red smartmatches primary&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The table of
smartmatches in &quot;Smartmatch Operator&quot; in perlop is
not identical to that proposed by the Raku specification,
mainly due to differences between Raku&rsquo;s and Perl
5&rsquo;s data models, but also because the Raku spec has
changed since Perl 5 rushed into early adoption.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Raku,
&quot;when()&quot; will always do an implicit smartmatch
with its argument, while in Perl 5 it is convenient (albeit
potentially confusing) to suppress this implicit smartmatch
in various rather loosely-defined situations, as roughly
outlined above. (The difference is largely because Perl 5
does not have, even internally, a boolean type.)</p>
