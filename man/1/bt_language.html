<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the
problems with BibTeX is that there is no formal
specification of the language. This means that users
exploring the arcane corners of the language are largely on
their own, and programmers implementing their own parsers
are completely on their own&minus;&minus;&minus;except for
observing the behaviour of the original implementation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other parser
implementors (Nelson Beebe of &quot;bibclean&quot; fame, in
particular) have taken the trouble to explain the language
accepted by their parser, and in that spirit the following
is presented.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
unfamiliar with the arcana of regular and context-free
languages, you will not have any easy time understanding
this. This is <i>not</i> an introduction to the BibTeX
language; any LaTeX book would be more suitable for learning
the data language itself.</p>

<h2>LEXICAL GRAMMAR
<a name="LEXICAL GRAMMAR"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The lexical
scanner has three distinct modes: top-level, in-entry, and
string. Roughly speaking, top-level is the initial mode; we
enter in-entry mode on seeing an &quot;@&quot; at top-level;
and on seeing the &quot;}&quot; or &quot;)&quot; that ends
the entry, we return to top-level. We enter string mode on
seeing a &quot;&quot;&quot; or non-entry-delimiting
&quot;{&quot; from in-entry mode. Note that the lexical
language is both non-regular (because braces must balance)
and context-sensitive (because &quot;{&quot; can mean
different things depending on its syntactic context). That
said, we will use regular expressions to describe the
lexical elements, because they are the starting point used
by the lexical scanner itself. The rest of the lexical
grammar will be informally explained in the text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From top-level,
the following tokens are recognized according to the regular
expressions on the right:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">AT \@ <br>
NEWLINE \n <br>
COMMENT \%~[\n]*\n <br>
WHITESPACE [\ \r\t]+ <br>
JUNK ~[\@\n\ \r\t]+</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Note that this
is <small>PCCTS</small> regular expression syntax, which
should be fairly familiar to users of other regex engines.
One oddity is that a character class is negated as
&quot;~[...]&quot; rather than &quot;[^...]&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On seeing
&quot;at&quot; at top-level, we enter in-entry mode.
Whitespace, junk, newlines, and comments are all skipped,
with the latter two incrementing a line counter. (Junk is
explicitly recognized to allow for
&quot;bibtex&quot;&rsquo;s &quot;implicit comment&quot;
scheme.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">From in-entry
mode, we recognize newline, comment, and whitespace
identically to top-level mode. In addition, the following
tokens are recognized:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NUMBER
[0&minus;9]+ <br>
NAME
[a&minus;z0&minus;9\!\$\&amp;\*\+\&minus;\.\/\:\;\&lt;\&gt;\?\[\]\^\_\`\|]+
<br>
LBRACE \{ <br>
RBRACE \} <br>
LPAREN \( <br>
RPAREN \) <br>
EQUALS = <br>
HASH \# <br>
COMMA , <br>
QUOTE \&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At this point,
the lexical scanner starts to sound suspiciously like a
context-free grammar, rather than a collection of
independent regular expressions. However, it is necessary to
keep this complexity in the scanner because certain
characters (&quot;{&quot; and &quot;(&quot; in particular)
have very different lexical meanings depending on the tokens
that have preceded them in the input stream.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In particular,
&quot;{&quot; and &quot;(&quot; are treated as &quot;entry
openers&quot; if they follow one &quot;at&quot; and one
&quot;name&quot; token, unless the value of the
&quot;name&quot; token is &quot;comment&quot;. (Note the
switch from top-level to in-entry between the two tokens.)
In the @comment case, the delimiter is considered as
starting a string, and we enter string mode. Otherwise, the
delimiter is saved, and when we see a corresponding
&quot;}&quot; or &quot;)&quot; it is considered an
&quot;entry closer&quot;. (Braces are balanced for free here
because the string lexer takes care of counting
brace-depth.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anywhere else,
&quot;{&quot; is considered as starting a string, and we
enter string mode. &quot;&quot;&quot; always starts a
string, regardless of context. The other tokens
(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, &quot;equals&quot;,
&quot;hash&quot;, and &quot;comma&quot;) are recognized
unconditionally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;name&quot; is a catch-all token used for entry types,
citation keys, field names, and macro names; because BibTeX
has slightly different (largely undocumented) rules for
these various elements, a bit of trickery is needed to make
things work. As a starting point, consider BibTeX&rsquo;s
definition of what&rsquo;s allowed for an entry key: a
sequence of any characters <i>except</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot; # % ' (
) , = { }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">plus space.
There are a couple of problems with this scheme. First,
without specifying the character set from which those
&quot;magic 10&quot; characters are drawn, it&rsquo;s a bit
hard to know just what is allowed. Second, allowing
&quot;@&quot; characters could lead to confusing BibTeX
syntax (it doesn&rsquo;t confuse BibTeX, but it might
confuse a human reader). Finally, allowing certain
characters that are special to TeX means that BibTeX can
generate bogus TeX code: try putting a backslash
(&quot;\&quot;) or tilde (&quot;~&quot;) in a citation key.
(This last exception is rather specific to the
&quot;generating (La)TeX code from a BibTeX database&quot;
application, but since that&rsquo;s the major application
for BibTeX databases, then it will presumably be the major
application for <b>btparse</b>, at least initially. Thus, it
makes sense to pay attention to this problem.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In
<b>btparse</b>, then, a name is defined as any sequence of
letters, digits, underscores, and the following
characters:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">! $ &amp; * +
&minus; . / : ; &lt; &gt; ? [ ] ^ _ ` |</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This list was
derived by removing BibTeX&rsquo;s &quot;magic 10&quot; from
the set of printable 7&minus;bit <small>ASCII</small>
characters (32&minus;126), and then further removing
&quot;@&quot;, &quot;\&quot;, and &quot;~&quot;. This means
that <b>btparse</b> disallows some of the weirder entry keys
that BibTeX would accept, such as &quot;\foo@bar&quot;, but
still allows a string with initial digits. In fact, from the
above definition it appears that <b>btparse</b> would accept
a string of all digits as a &quot;name;&quot; this is not
the case, though, as the lexical scanner recognizes such a
digit string as a number first. There are two problems here:
BibTeX entry keys may in fact be entirely numeric, and field
names may not begin with a digit. (Those are two of the
not-so-obvious differences in BibTeX&rsquo;s handling of
keys and field names.) The tricks used to deal with these
problems are implemented in the parser rather than the
lexical scanner, so are described in &quot; <small>SYNTACTIC
GRAMMAR&quot;</small> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The string
lexer recognizes &quot;lbrace&quot;, &quot;rbrace&quot;,
&quot;lparen&quot;, and &quot;rparen&quot; tokens in order
to count brace&minus; or parenthesis-depth. This is
necessary so it knows when to accept a string delimited by
braces or parentheses. (Note that a parenthesis-delimited
string is only allowed after
@comment&minus;&minus;&minus;this is not a normal BibTeX
construct.) In addition, it converts each non-space
whitespace character (newline, carriage-return, and tab) to
a single space. (Sequences of whitespace are not collapsed;
that&rsquo;s the domain of string post-processing, which is
well removed from the scanner or parser.) Finally, it
accepts &quot;&quot;&quot; to delimit quote-delimited
strings. Apart from those restrictions, the string lexer
accepts anything up to the end-of-string delimiter.</p>

<h2>SYNTACTIC GRAMMAR
<a name="SYNTACTIC GRAMMAR"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(The language
used to describe the grammar here is the extended
Backus-Naur Form ( <small>EBNF</small> ) used by
<small>PCCTS.</small> Terminals are represented by uppercase
strings, non-terminals by lowercase strings; terminal names
are the same as those given in the lexical grammar above.
&quot;( foo )*&quot; means zero or more repetitions of the
&quot;foo&quot; production, and &quot;{ foo }&quot; means an
optional &quot;foo&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A file is just
a sequence of zero or more entries:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">bibfile : (
entry )*</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An entry is an
at-sign, a name (the &quot;entry type&quot;), and the entry
body:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">entry : AT NAME
body</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A body is
either a string (this alternative is only tried if the entry
type is &quot;comment&quot;) or the entry contents:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">body : STRING #
for comment entries <br>
| ENTRY_OPEN contents ENTRY_CLOSE</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(&quot;ENTRY_OPEN&quot;
and &quot;ENTRY_CLOSE&quot; are either &quot;{&quot; and
&quot;}&quot; or &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;, depending
what is seen in the input for a particular entry.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
possible productions for the &quot;contents&quot;
non-terminal. Only one applies to any given entry, depending
on the entry metatype (which in turn depends on the entry
type). Currently, <b>btparse</b> supports four entry
metatypes: comment, preamble, macro definition, and regular.
The first two correspond to @comment and @preamble entries;
&quot;macro definition&quot; is for @string entries; and
&quot;regular&quot; is for all other entry types. (The
library will be extended to handle @modify and @alias entry
types, and corresponding &quot;modify&quot; and
&quot;alias&quot; metatypes, when BibTeX 1.0 is released and
the exact syntax is known.) The &quot;metatype&quot; concept
is necessary so that all entry types that aren&rsquo;t
specifically recognized fall into the &quot;regular&quot;
metatype. It&rsquo;s also convenient not to have to
&quot;strcmp&quot; the entry type all the time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">contents : (
NAME | NUMBER ) COMMA fields # for regular entries <br>
| fields # for macro definition entries <br>
| value # for preamble entries</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
entry key is not just a &quot;NAME&quot;, but &quot;( NAME |
NUMBER)&quot;. This is necessary because BibTeX allows
all-numeric entry keys, but <b>btparse</b>&rsquo;s lexical
scanner recognizes such digit strings as &quot;NUMBER&quot;
tokens.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;fields&quot;
is a comma-separated list of fields, with an optional single
trailing comma:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">fields : field
{ COMMA fields } <br>
|</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;field&quot; is a single &quot;field = value&quot;
assignment:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">field : NAME
EQUALS value</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;NAME&quot; here is a restricted version of the
&quot;name&quot; token described in &quot; <small>LEXICAL
GRAMMAR&quot;</small> above. Any &quot;name&quot; token will
be accepted by the parser, but it is immediately checked to
ensure that it doesn&rsquo;t begin with a digit; if so, an
artificial syntax error is triggered. (This is for
compatibility with BibTeX, which doesn&rsquo;t allow field
names to start with a digit.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;value&quot; is a series of simple values joined by '#'
characters:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">value :
simple_value ( HASH simple_value )*</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A simple value
is a string, number, or name (for macro invocations):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">simple_value :
STRING <br>
| NUMBER <br>
| NAME</p>
