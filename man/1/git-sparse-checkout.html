<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">git-sparse-checkout
&minus; Reduce your working tree to a subset of tracked
files</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
sparse&minus;checkout</i> (init | list | set | add | reapply
| disable) [&lt;options&gt;]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
used to create sparse checkouts, which change the working
tree from having all tracked files present to only having a
subset of those files. It can also switch which subset of
files are present, or undo and go back to having all tracked
files present in the working copy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The subset of
files is chosen by providing a list of directories in cone
mode (the default), or by providing a list of patterns in
non&minus;cone mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When in a
sparse&minus;checkout, other Git commands behave a bit
differently. For example, switching branches will not update
paths outside the sparse&minus;checkout
directories/patterns, and <b>git commit &minus;a</b> will
not record paths outside the sparse&minus;checkout
directories/patterns as deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">THIS COMMAND IS
EXPERIMENTAL. ITS BEHAVIOR, AND THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHER
COMMANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF SPARSE&minus;CHECKOUTS, WILL
LIKELY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>list</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Describe the directories or
patterns in the sparse&minus;checkout file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>set</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable the necessary
sparse&minus;checkout config settings
(<b>core.sparseCheckout</b>, <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b>,
and <b>index.sparse</b>) if they are not already set to the
desired values, populate the sparse&minus;checkout file from
the list of arguments following the <i>set</i> subcommand,
and update the working directory to match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To ensure that
adjusting the sparse&minus;checkout settings within a
worktree does not alter the sparse&minus;checkout settings
in other worktrees, the <i>set</i> subcommand will upgrade
your repository config to use worktree&minus;specific config
if not already present. The sparsity defined by the
arguments to the <i>set</i> subcommand are stored in the
worktree&minus;specific sparse&minus;checkout file. See
<b>git-worktree</b>(1) and the documentation of
<b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1) for
more details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>&minus;&minus;stdin</b> option is provided, the
directories or patterns are read from standard in as a
newline&minus;delimited list instead of from the
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
input list is considered a list of directories, matching the
output of <b>git ls&minus;tree &minus;d
&minus;&minus;name&minus;only</b>. This includes
interpreting pathnames that begin with a double quote
(&quot;) as C&minus;style quoted strings. Note that all
files under the specified directories (at any depth) will be
included in the sparse checkout, as well as files that are
siblings of either the given directory or any of its
ancestors (see <i>CONE PATTERN SET</i> below for more
details). In the past, this was not the default, and
<b>&minus;&minus;cone</b> needed to be specified or
<b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> needed to be enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;cone</b> is passed, the input list
is considered a list of patterns. This mode has a number of
drawbacks, including not working with some options like
<b>&minus;&minus;sparse&minus;index</b>. As explained in the
&quot;Non&minus;cone Problems&quot; section below, we do not
recommend using it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use the
<b>&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]sparse&minus;index</b> option to
use a sparse index (the default is to not use it). A sparse
index reduces the size of the index to be more closely
aligned with your sparse&minus;checkout definition. This can
have significant performance advantages for commands such as
<b>git status</b> or <b>git add</b>. This feature is still
experimental. Some commands might be slower with a sparse
index until they are properly integrated with the
feature.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>WARNING:</b>
Using a sparse index requires modifying the index in a way
that is not completely understood by external tools. If you
have trouble with this compatibility, then run <b>git
sparse&minus;checkout init
&minus;&minus;no&minus;sparse&minus;index</b> to rewrite
your index to not be sparse. Older versions of Git will not
understand the sparse directory entries index extension and
may fail to interact with your repository until it is
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>add</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Update the
sparse&minus;checkout file to include additional directories
(in cone mode) or patterns (in non&minus;cone mode). By
default, these directories or patterns are read from the
command&minus;line arguments, but they can be read from
stdin using the <b>&minus;&minus;stdin</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>reapply</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reapply the sparsity pattern
rules to paths in the working tree. Commands like merge or
rebase can materialize paths to do their work (e.g. in order
to show you a conflict), and other sparse&minus;checkout
commands might fail to sparsify an individual file (e.g.
because it has unstaged changes or conflicts). In such
cases, it can make sense to run <b>git sparse&minus;checkout
reapply</b> later after cleaning up affected paths (e.g.
resolving conflicts, undoing or committing changes,
etc.).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>reapply</b> command can also take
<b>&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]cone</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]sparse&minus;index</b> flags,
with the same meaning as the flags from the <b>set</b>
command, in order to change which sparsity mode you are
using without needing to also respecify all sparsity
paths.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>disable</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disable the
<b>core.sparseCheckout</b> config setting, and restore the
working directory to include all files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>init</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Deprecated command that behaves
like <b>set</b> with no specified paths. May be removed in
the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Historically,
<b>set</b> did not handle all the necessary config settings,
which meant that both <b>init</b> and <b>set</b> had to be
called. Invoking both meant the <b>init</b> step would first
remove nearly all tracked files (and in cone mode, ignored
files too), then the <b>set</b> step would add many of the
tracked files (but not ignored files) back. In addition to
the lost files, the performance and UI of this combination
was poor.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also,
historically, <b>init</b> would not actually initialize the
sparse&minus;checkout file if it already existed. This meant
it was possible to return to a sparse&minus;checkout without
remembering which paths to pass to a subsequent <i>set</i>
or <i>add</i> command. However, <b>&minus;&minus;cone</b>
and <b>&minus;&minus;sparse&minus;index</b> options would
not be remembered across the disable command, so the easy
restore of calling a plain <b>init</b> decreased in
utility.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
sparse&minus;checkout set MY/DIR1 SUB/DIR2</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Change to a sparse checkout
with all files (at any depth) under MY/DIR1/ and SUB/DIR2/
present in the working copy (plus all files immediately
under MY/ and SUB/ and the toplevel directory). If already
in a sparse checkout, change which files are present in the
working copy to this new selection. Note that this command
will also delete all ignored files in any directory that no
longer has either tracked or
non&minus;ignored&minus;untracked files present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
sparse&minus;checkout disable</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Repopulate the working
directory with all files, disabling sparse checkouts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
sparse&minus;checkout add SOME/DIR/ECTORY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add all files under
SOME/DIR/ECTORY/ (at any depth) to the sparse checkout, as
well as all files immediately under SOME/DIR/ and
immediately under SOME/. Must already be in a sparse
checkout before using this command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
sparse&minus;checkout reapply</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">It is possible for commands to
update the working tree in a way that does not respect the
selected sparsity directories. This can come from tools
external to Git writing files, or even affect Git commands
because of either special cases (such as hitting conflicts
when merging/rebasing), or because some commands
didn&rsquo;t fully support sparse checkouts (e.g. the old
<b>recursive</b> merge backend had only limited support).
This command reapplies the existing sparse directory
specifications to make the working directory match.</p>

<h2>INTERNALS &mdash; SPARSE CHECKOUT
<a name="INTERNALS &mdash; SPARSE CHECKOUT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Sparse
checkout&quot; allows populating the working directory
sparsely. It uses the skip&minus;worktree bit (see
<b>git-update-index</b>(1)) to tell Git whether a file in
the working directory is worth looking at. If the
skip&minus;worktree bit is set, and the file is not present
in the working tree, then its absence is ignored. Git will
avoid populating the contents of those files, which makes a
sparse checkout helpful when working in a repository with
many files, but only a few are important to the current
user.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse&minus;checkout</b> file is used to
define the skip&minus;worktree reference bitmap. When Git
updates the working directory, it updates the
skip&minus;worktree bits in the index based on this file.
The files matching the patterns in the file will appear in
the working directory, and the rest will not.</p>

<h2>INTERNALS &mdash; NON&minus;CONE PROBLEMS
<a name="INTERNALS &mdash; NON&minus;CONE PROBLEMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse&minus;checkout</b> file populated by
the <b>set</b> and <b>add</b> subcommands is defined to be a
bunch of patterns (one per line) using the same syntax as
<b>.gitignore</b> files. In cone mode, these patterns are
restricted to matching directories (and users only ever need
supply or see directory names), while in non&minus;cone mode
any gitignore&minus;style pattern is permitted. Using the
full gitignore&minus;style patterns in non&minus;cone mode
has a number of shortcomings:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Fundamentally, it makes various worktree&minus;updating
processes (pull, merge, rebase, switch, reset, checkout,
etc.) require O(N*M) pattern matches, where N is the number
of patterns and M is the number of paths in the index. This
scales poorly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Avoiding
the scaling issue has to be done via limiting the number of
patterns via specifying leading directory name or glob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Passing
globs on the command line is error&minus;prone as users may
forget to quote the glob, causing the shell to expand it
into all matching files and pass them all individually along
to sparse&minus;checkout set/add. While this could also be a
problem with e.g. &quot;git grep &mdash; *.c&quot;, mistakes
with grep/log/status appear in the immediate output. With
sparse&minus;checkout, the mistake gets recorded at the time
the sparse&minus;checkout command is run and might not be
problematic until the user later switches branches or
rebases or merges, thus putting a delay between the
user&rsquo;s error and when they have a chance to
catch/notice it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Related
to the previous item, sparse&minus;checkout has an
<i>add</i> subcommand but no <i>remove</i> subcommand. Even
if a <i>remove</i> subcommand were added, undoing an
accidental unquoted glob runs the risk of &quot;removing too
much&quot;, as it may remove entries that had been included
before the accidental add.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
Non&minus;cone mode uses gitignore&minus;style patterns to
select what to <b>include</b> (with the exception of negated
patterns), while .gitignore files use gitignore&minus;style
patterns to select what to <b>exclude</b> (with the
exception of negated patterns). The documentation on
gitignore&minus;style patterns usually does not talk in
terms of matching or non&minus;matching, but on what the
user wants to &quot;exclude&quot;. This can cause confusion
for users trying to learn how to specify
sparse&minus;checkout patterns to get their desired
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Every
other git subcommand that wants to provide &quot;special
path pattern matching&quot; of some sort uses pathspecs, but
non&minus;cone mode for sparse&minus;checkout uses gitignore
patterns, which feels inconsistent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; It has
edge cases where the &quot;right&quot; behavior is unclear.
Two examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">First, two
users are in a subdirectory, and the first runs <br>
git sparse&minus;checkout set '/toplevel&minus;dir/*.c' <br>
while the second runs <br>
git sparse&minus;checkout set relative&minus;dir <br>
Should those arguments be transliterated into <br>
current/subdirectory/toplevel&minus;dir/*.c <br>
and <br>
current/subdirectory/relative&minus;dir <br>
before inserting into the sparse&minus;checkout file? The
user who typed <br>
the first command is probably aware that arguments to
set/add are <br>
supposed to be patterns in non&minus;cone mode, and probably
would not be <br>
happy with such a transliteration. However, many
gitignore&minus;style <br>
patterns are just paths, which might be what the user who
typed the <br>
second command was thinking, and they'd be upset if their
argument <br>
wasn't transliterated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Second, what
should bash&minus;completion complete on for set/add
commands <br>
for non&minus;cone users? If it suggests paths, is it
exacerbating the <br>
problem above? Also, if it suggests paths, what if the user
has a <br>
file or directory that begins with either a '!' or '#' or
has a '*', <br>
'\', '?', '[', or ']' in its name? And if it suggests paths,
will <br>
it complete &quot;/pro&quot; to &quot;/proc&quot; (in the
root filesytem) rather than to <br>
&quot;/progress.txt&quot; in the current directory? (Note
that users are <br>
likely to want to start paths with a leading '/' in
non&minus;cone mode, <br>
for the same reason that .gitignore files often have one.)
<br>
Completing on files or directories might give nasty
surprises in <br>
all these cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
excessive flexibility made other extensions essentially
impractical. <b>&minus;&minus;sparse&minus;index</b> is
likely impossible in non&minus;cone mode; even if it is
somehow feasible, it would have been far more work to
implement and may have been too slow in practice. Some ideas
for adding coupling between partial clones and sparse
checkouts are only practical with a more restricted set of
paths as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For all these
reasons, non&minus;cone mode is deprecated. Please switch to
using cone mode.</p>

<h2>INTERNALS &mdash; CONE MODE HANDLING
<a name="INTERNALS &mdash; CONE MODE HANDLING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The &quot;cone
mode&quot;, which is the default, lets you specify only what
directories to include. For any directory specified, all
paths below that directory will be included, and any paths
immediately under leading directories (including the
toplevel directory) will also be included. Thus, if you
specified the directory Documentation/technical/ then your
sparse checkout would contain:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; all
files in the toplevel&minus;directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; all
files immediately under Documentation/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; all
files at any depth under Documentation/technical/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, in cone
mode, even if no directories are specified, then the files
in the toplevel directory will be included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When changing
the sparse&minus;checkout patterns in cone mode, Git will
inspect each tracked directory that is not within the
sparse&minus;checkout cone to see if it contains any
untracked files. If all of those files are ignored due to
the <b>.gitignore</b> patterns, then the directory will be
deleted. If any of the untracked files within that directory
is not ignored, then no deletions will occur within that
directory and a warning message will appear. If these files
are important, then reset your sparse&minus;checkout
definition so they are included, use <b>git add</b> and
<b>git commit</b> to store them, then remove any remaining
files manually to ensure Git can behave optimally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also the
&quot;Internals &mdash; Cone Pattern Set&quot; section to
learn how the directories are transformed under the hood
into a subset of the Full Pattern Set of
sparse&minus;checkout.</p>

<h2>INTERNALS &mdash; FULL PATTERN SET
<a name="INTERNALS &mdash; FULL PATTERN SET"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The full
pattern set allows for arbitrary pattern matches and
complicated inclusion/exclusion rules. These can result in
O(N*M) pattern matches when updating the index, where N is
the number of patterns and M is the number of paths in the
index. To combat this performance issue, a more restricted
pattern set is allowed when <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b>
is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
sparse&minus;checkout file uses the same syntax as
<b>.gitignore</b> files; see <b>gitignore</b>(5) for
details. Here, though, the patterns are usually being used
to select which files to include rather than which files to
exclude. (However, it can get a bit confusing since
gitignore&minus;style patterns have negations defined by
patterns which begin with a <i>!</i>, so you can also select
files to <i>not</i> include.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
select everything, and then to remove the file
<b>unwanted</b> (so that every file will appear in your
working tree except the file named <b>unwanted</b>):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">git
sparse&minus;checkout set &minus;&minus;no&minus;cone '/*'
'!unwanted'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These patterns
are just placed into the
<b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse&minus;checkout</b> as&minus;is, so
the contents of that file at this point would be</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">/* <br>
!unwanted</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also the
&quot;Sparse Checkout&quot; section of
<b>git-read-tree</b>(1) to learn more about the
gitignore&minus;style patterns used in sparse checkouts.</p>

<h2>INTERNALS &mdash; CONE PATTERN SET
<a name="INTERNALS &mdash; CONE PATTERN SET"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In cone mode,
only directories are accepted, but they are translated into
the same gitignore&minus;style patterns used in the full
pattern set. We refer to the particular patterns used in
those mode as being of one of two types:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1.
<b>Recursive:</b> All paths inside a directory are
included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2.
<b>Parent:</b> All files immediately inside a directory are
included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since cone mode
always includes files at the toplevel, when running <b>git
sparse&minus;checkout set</b> with no directories specified,
the toplevel directory is added as a parent pattern. At this
point, the sparse&minus;checkout file contains the following
patterns:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">/* <br>
!/*/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This says
&quot;include everything immediately under the toplevel
directory, but nothing at any level below that.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When in cone
mode, the <b>git sparse&minus;checkout set</b> subcommand
takes a list of directories. The command <b>git
sparse&minus;checkout set A/B/C</b> sets the directory
<b>A/B/C</b> as a recursive pattern, the directories
<b>A</b> and <b>A/B</b> are added as parent patterns. The
resulting sparse&minus;checkout file is now</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">/* <br>
!/*/ <br>
/A/ <br>
!/A/*/ <br>
/A/B/ <br>
!/A/B/*/ <br>
/A/B/C/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here, order
matters, so the negative patterns are overridden by the
positive patterns that appear lower in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless
<b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> is explicitly set to
<b>false</b>, Git will parse the sparse&minus;checkout file
expecting patterns of these types. Git will warn if the
patterns do not match. If the patterns do match the expected
format, then Git will use faster hash&minus;based algorithms
to compute inclusion in the sparse&minus;checkout. If they
do not match, git will behave as though
<b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> was false, regardless of its
setting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the cone
mode case, despite the fact that full patterns are written
to the $GIT_DIR/info/sparse&minus;checkout file, the <b>git
sparse&minus;checkout list</b> subcommand will list the
directories that define the recursive patterns. For the
example sparse&minus;checkout file above, the output is as
follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
sparse&minus;checkout list <br>
A/B/C</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>core.ignoreCase=true</b>, then the pattern&minus;matching
algorithm will use a case&minus;insensitive check. This
corrects for case mismatched filenames in the <i>git
sparse&minus;checkout set</i> command to reflect the
expected cone in the working directory.</p>

<h2>INTERNALS &mdash; SUBMODULES
<a name="INTERNALS &mdash; SUBMODULES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your
repository contains one or more submodules, then submodules
are populated based on interactions with the <b>git
submodule</b> command. Specifically, <b>git submodule init
&minus;&minus; &lt;path&gt;</b> will ensure the submodule at
<b>&lt;path&gt;</b> is present, while <b>git submodule
deinit [&minus;f] &minus;&minus; &lt;path&gt;</b> will
remove the files for the submodule at <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
(including any untracked files, uncommitted changes, and
unpushed history). Similar to how sparse&minus;checkout
removes files from the working tree but still leaves entries
in the index, deinitialized submodules are removed from the
working directory but still have an entry in the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
submodules may have unpushed changes or untracked files,
removing them could result in data loss. Thus, changing
sparse inclusion/exclusion rules will not cause an already
checked out submodule to be removed from the working copy.
Said another way, just as <b>checkout</b> will not cause
submodules to be automatically removed or initialized even
when switching between branches that remove or add
submodules, using <b>sparse&minus;checkout</b> to reduce or
expand the scope of &quot;interesting&quot; files will not
cause submodules to be automatically deinitialized or
initialized either.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Further, the
above facts mean that there are multiple reasons that
&quot;tracked&quot; files might not be present in the
working copy: sparsity pattern application from
sparse&minus;checkout, and submodule initialization state.
Thus, commands like <b>git grep</b> that work on tracked
files in the working copy may return results that are
limited by either or both of these restrictions.</p>
