<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perltru64
&minus; Perl version 5 on Tru64 (formerly known as Digital
UNIX formerly known as DEC OSF/1) systems</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes various features of <small>HP</small> &rsquo;s
(formerly Compaq&rsquo;s, formerly Digital&rsquo;s) Unix
operating system (Tru64) that will affect how Perl version 5
(hereafter just Perl) is configured, compiled and/or
runs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compiling
Perl 5 on Tru64</b> <br>
The recommended compiler to use in Tru64 is the native C
compiler. The native compiler produces much faster code (the
speed difference is noticeable: several dozen percentages)
and also more correct code: if you are considering using the
<small>GNU C</small> compiler you should use at the very
least the release of 2.95.3 since all older gcc releases are
known to produce broken code when compiling Perl. One
manifestation of this brokenness is the lib/sdbm test
dumping core; another is many of the op/regexp and op/pat,
or ext/Storable tests dumping core (the exact pattern of
failures depending on the <small>GCC</small> release and
optimization flags).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both the native
cc and gcc seem to consume lots of memory when building
Perl. toke.c is a known trouble spot when optimizing: 256
megabytes of data section seems to be enough. Another known
trouble spot is the mktables script which builds the Unicode
support tables. The default setting of the process data
section in Tru64 should be one gigabyte, but some
sites/setups might have lowered that. The configuration
process of Perl checks for too low process limits, and
lowers the optimization for the toke.c if necessary, and
also gives advice on how to raise the process limits (for
example: &quot;ulimit &minus;d 262144&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, Configure
might abort with</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Build a
threading Perl? [n] <br>
Configure[2437]: Syntax error at line 1 : 'config.sh' is not
expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This indicates
that Configure is being run with a broken Korn shell (even
though you think you are using a Bourne shell by using
&quot;sh Configure&quot; or &quot;./Configure&quot;). The
Korn shell bug has been reported to Compaq as of February
1999 but in the meanwhile, the reason ksh is being used is
that you have the environment variable <small>BIN_SH</small>
set to &rsquo;xpg4&rsquo;. This causes /bin/sh to delegate
its duties to /bin/posix/sh (a ksh). Unset the environment
variable and rerun Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using Large
Files with Perl on Tru64</b> <br>
In Tru64 Perl is automatically able to use large files, that
is, files larger than 2 gigabytes, there is no need to use
the Configure &minus;Duselargefiles option as described in
<small>INSTALL</small> (though using the option is
harmless).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Threaded
Perl on Tru64</b> <br>
If you want to use threads, you should primarily use the
Perl 5.8.0 threads model by running Configure with
&minus;Duseithreads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl threading
is going to work only in Tru64 4.0 and newer releases, older
operating releases like 3.2 aren&rsquo;t probably going to
work properly with threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Tru64 V5 (at
least V5.1A, V5.1B) you cannot build threaded Perl with gcc
because the system header &lt;pthread.h&gt; explicitly
checks for supported C compilers, gcc (at least 3.2.2) not
being one of them. But the system C compiler should work
just fine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Long Doubles
on Tru64</b> <br>
You cannot Configure Perl to use long doubles unless you
have at least Tru64 V5.0, the long double support simply
wasn&rsquo;t functional enough before that. Perl&rsquo;s
Configure will override attempts to use the long doubles
(you can notice this by Configure finding out that the
<b>modfl()</b> function does not work as it should).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At the time of
this writing (June 2002), there is a known bug in the Tru64
libc printing of long doubles when not using &quot;e&quot;
notation. The values are correct and usable, but you only
get a limited number of digits displayed unless you force
the issue by using &quot;printf &quot;%.33e&quot;,$num&quot;
or the like. For Tru64 versions V5.0A through V5.1A, a patch
is expected sometime after perl 5.8.0 is released. If your
libc has not yet been patched, you&rsquo;ll get a warning
from Configure when selecting long doubles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>DB_File
tests failing on Tru64</b> <br>
The DB_File tests (db&minus;btree.t, db&minus;hash.t,
db&minus;recno.t) may fail you have installed a newer
version of Berkeley <small>DB</small> into the system and
the &minus;I and &minus;L compiler and linker flags
introduce version conflicts with the <small>DB 1.85</small>
headers and libraries that came with the Tru64. For example,
mixing a <small>DB</small> v2 library with the
<small>DB</small> v1 headers is a bad idea. Watch out for
Configure options &minus;Dlocincpth and &minus;Dloclibpth,
and check your /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib since
they are included by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
option is to explicitly instruct Configure to detect the
newer Berkeley <small>DB</small> installation, by supplying
the right directories with
&quot;&minus;Dlocincpth=/some/include&quot; and
&quot;&minus;Dloclibpth=/some/lib&quot; <b>and</b> before
running &quot;make test&quot; setting your
<small>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</small> to <i>/some/lib</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third
option is to work around the problem by disabling the
DB_File completely when build Perl by specifying
&minus;Ui_db to Configure, and then using the BerkeleyDB
module from <small>CPAN</small> instead of DB_File. The
BerkeleyDB works with Berkeley <small>DB</small> versions
2.* or greater.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Berkeley
<small>DB 4.1.25</small> has been tested with Tru64 V5.1A
and found to work. The latest Berkeley <small>DB</small> can
be found from &lt;http://www.sleepycat.com&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>64&minus;bit
Perl on Tru64</b> <br>
In Tru64 Perl&rsquo;s integers are automatically
64&minus;bit wide, there is no need to use the Configure
&minus;Duse64bitint option as described in
<small>INSTALL.</small> Similarly, there is no need for
&minus;Duse64bitall since pointers are automatically
64&minus;bit wide.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warnings
about floating-point overflow when compiling Perl on
Tru64</b> <br>
When compiling Perl in Tru64 you may (depending on the
compiler release) see two warnings like this</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cc: Warning:
numeric.c, line 104: In this statement, floating&minus;point
<br>
overflow occurs in evaluating the expression
&quot;1.8e308&quot;. (floatoverfl) <br>
return HUGE_VAL; <br>

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;^</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and when
compiling the <small>POSIX</small> extension</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">cc: Warning:
const&minus;c.inc, line 2007: In this statement,
floating&minus;point <br>
overflow occurs in evaluating the expression
&quot;1.8e308&quot;. (floatoverfl) <br>
return HUGE_VAL; <br>

&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;^</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exact line
numbers may vary between Perl releases. The warnings are
benign and can be ignored: in later C compiler releases the
warnings should be gone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the file
<i>pp_sys.c</i> is being compiled you may (depending on the
operating system release) see an additional compiler flag
being used: &quot;&minus;DNO_EFF_ONLY_OK&quot;. This is
normal and refers to a feature that is relevant only if you
use the &quot;filetest&quot; pragma. In older releases of
the operating system the feature was broken and the
<small>NO_EFF_ONLY_OK</small> instructs Perl not to use the
feature.</p>

<h2>Testing Perl on Tru64

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During
&quot;make test&quot; the &quot;comp&quot;/&quot;cpp&quot;
will be skipped because on Tru64 it cannot be tested before
Perl has been installed. The test refers to the use of the
&quot;&minus;P&quot; option of Perl.</p>

<h2>ext/ODBM_File/odbm Test Failing With Static Builds
<a name="ext/ODBM_File/odbm Test Failing With Static Builds"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
ext/ODBM_File/odbm is known to fail with static builds
(Configure &minus;Uusedl) due to a known bug in
Tru64&rsquo;s static libdbm library. The good news is that
you very probably don&rsquo;t need to ever use the ODBM_File
extension since more advanced NDBM_File works fine, not to
mention the even more advanced DB_File.</p>

<h2>Perl Fails Because Of Unresolved Symbol sockatmark
<a name="Perl Fails Because Of Unresolved Symbol sockatmark"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you get an
error like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Can't load
'.../OSF1/lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha&minus;dec_osf/auto/IO/IO.so'

sockatmark at
.../lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha&minus;dec_osf/XSLoader.pm line
75.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">you need to
either recompile your Perl in Tru64 4.0D or upgrade your
Tru64 4.0D to at least 4.0F: the <b>sockatmark()</b> system
call was added in Tru64 4.0F, and the <small>IO</small>
extension refers that symbol.</p>

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may be
mixing the Tru64 cc/ar/ld with the <small>GNU</small>
gcc/ar/ld. That may work, but sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t
(your gcc or <small>GNU</small> utils may have been compiled
for an incompatible <small>OS</small> release).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Try
&rsquo;which ld&rsquo; and &rsquo;which ld&rsquo; (or try
&rsquo;ar &minus;&minus;version&rsquo; and &rsquo;ld
&minus;&minus;version&rsquo;, which work only for the
<small>GNU</small> tools, and will announce themselves to be
such), and adjust your <small>PATH</small> so that you are
consistently using either the native tools or the
<small>GNU</small> tools. After fixing your
<small>PATH,</small> you should do &rsquo;make
distclean&rsquo; and start all the way from running the
Configure since you may have quite a confused situation.</p>
