<h2>NAME

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl5224delta
&minus; what is new for perl v5.22.4</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes differences between the 5.22.3 release and the
5.22.4 release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.2, first read
perl5223delta, which describes differences between 5.22.2
and 5.22.3.</p>

<h2>Security

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Improved
handling of &rsquo;.&rsquo; in @INC in base.pm</b> <br>
The handling of (the removal of) '.' in @INC in base has
been improved. This resolves some problematic behaviour in
the approach taken in Perl 5.22.3, which is probably best
described in the following two threads on the Perl 5 Porters
mailing list:
&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html&gt;,
&lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/10/msg240297.html&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;Escaped&quot;
colons and relative paths in <small>PATH</small></b> <br>
On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the
<small>PATH</small> environment variable as tainted when
starting a new process. Previously, it was allowing a
backslash to escape a colon (unlike the <small>OS</small> ),
consequently allowing relative paths to be considered safe
if the <small>PATH</small> was set to something like
&quot;/\:.&quot;. The check has been fixed to treat
&quot;.&quot; as tainted in that example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.22.4
represents approximately 6 months of development since Perl
5.22.3 and contains approximately 2,200 lines of changes
across 52 files from 16 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Excluding
auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
were approximately 970 lines of changes to 18 .pm, .t, .c
and .h files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl continues
to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are
known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl
5.22.4:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Aaron Crane,
Abigail, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chris &rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo;
Williams, David Mitchell, Eric Herman, Father Chrysostomos,
James E Keenan, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai, Renee Baecker,
Ricardo Signes, Sawyer X, Stevan Little, Steve Hay, Tony
Cook.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The list above
is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it
does not include the names of the (very much appreciated)
contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many of the
changes included in this version originated in the
<small>CPAN</small> modules included in Perl&rsquo;s core.
We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire <small>CPAN</small>
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a more
complete list of all of Perl&rsquo;s historical
contributors, please see the <i><small>AUTHORS</small></i>
file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h2>Reporting Bugs
<a name="Reporting Bugs"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you find
what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the
perl bug database at https://rt.perl.org/ . There may also
be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home
Page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to
a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with
the output of &quot;perl &minus;V&quot;, will be sent off to
perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting
team.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the bug you
are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list,
then please send it to
perl5&minus;security&minus;report@perl.org. This points to a
closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able to help assess the
impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the
problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl
core, not for modules independently distributed on
<small>CPAN.</small></p>
