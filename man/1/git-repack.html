<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
used to combine all objects that do not currently reside in
a &quot;pack&quot;, into a pack. It can also be used to
re&minus;organize existing packs into a single, more
efficient pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pack is a
collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta
compression applied, stored in a single file, with an
associated index file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Packs are used
to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk
storage, etc.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;a</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of incrementally
packing the unpacked objects, pack everything referenced
into a single pack. Especially useful when packing a
repository that is used for private development. Use with
<b>&minus;d</b>. This will clean up the objects that <b>git
prune</b> leaves behind, but <b>git fsck &minus;&minus;full
&minus;&minus;dangling</b> shows as dangling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that users
fetching over dumb protocols will have to fetch the whole
new pack in order to get any contained object, no matter how
many other objects in that pack they already have
locally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Promisor
packfiles are repacked separately: if there are packfiles
that have an associated &quot;.promisor&quot; file, these
packfiles will be repacked into another separate pack, and
an empty &quot;.promisor&quot; file corresponding to the new
separate pack will be written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;A</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as <b>&minus;a</b>, unless
<b>&minus;d</b> is used. Then any unreachable objects in a
previous pack become loose, unpacked objects, instead of
being left in the old pack. Unreachable objects are never
intentionally added to a pack, even when repacking. This
option prevents unreachable objects from being immediately
deleted by way of being left in the old pack and then
removed. Instead, the loose unreachable objects will be
pruned according to normal expiry rules with the next <i>git
gc</i> invocation. See <b>git-gc</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">After packing, if the newly
created packs make some existing packs redundant, remove the
redundant packs. Also run <i>git prune&minus;packed</i> to
remove redundant loose object files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;cruft</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as <b>&minus;a</b>, unless
<b>&minus;d</b> is used. Then any unreachable objects are
packed into a separate cruft pack. Unreachable objects can
be pruned using the normal expiry rules with the next <b>git
gc</b> invocation (see <b>git-gc</b>(1)). Incompatible with
<b>&minus;k</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;cruft&minus;expiration=&lt;approxidate&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Expire unreachable objects
older than <b>&lt;approxidate&gt;</b> immediately instead of
waiting for the next <b>git gc</b> invocation. Only useful
with <b>&minus;&minus;cruft &minus;d</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;expire&minus;to=&lt;dir&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write a cruft pack containing
pruned objects (if any) to the directory <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>.
This option is useful for keeping a copy of any pruned
objects in a separate directory as a backup. Only useful
with <b>&minus;&minus;cruft &minus;d</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;l</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the
<b>&minus;&minus;local</b> option to <i>git
pack&minus;objects</i>. See <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;f</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;reuse&minus;delta</b> option to
<b>git&minus;pack&minus;objects</b>, see
<b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;F</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;reuse&minus;object</b> option to
<b>git&minus;pack&minus;objects</b>, see
<b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;q,
&minus;&minus;quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show no progress over the
standard error stream and pass the <b>&minus;q</b> option to
<i>git pack&minus;objects</i>. See
<b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;n</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not update the server
information with <i>git update&minus;server&minus;info</i>.
This option skips updating local catalog files needed to
publish this repository (or a direct copy of it) over HTTP
or FTP. See <b>git-update-server-info</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;window=&lt;n&gt;,
&minus;&minus;depth=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These two options affect how
the objects contained in the pack are stored using delta
compression. The objects are first internally sorted by
type, size and optionally names and compared against the
other objects within <b>&minus;&minus;window</b> to see if
using delta compression saves space.
<b>&minus;&minus;depth</b> limits the maximum delta depth;
making it too deep affects the performance on the unpacker
side, because delta data needs to be applied that many times
to get to the necessary object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value for &minus;&minus;window is 10 and &minus;&minus;depth
is 50. The maximum depth is 4095.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;threads=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option is passed through
to <b>git pack&minus;objects</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;window&minus;memory=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option provides an
additional limit on top of <b>&minus;&minus;window</b>; the
window size will dynamically scale down so as to not take up
more than <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> bytes in memory. This is useful
in repositories with a mix of large and small objects to not
run out of memory with a large window, but still be able to
take advantage of the large window for the smaller objects.
The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
or &quot;g&quot;. <b>&minus;&minus;window&minus;memory=0</b>
makes memory usage unlimited. The default is taken from the
<b>pack.windowMemory</b> configuration variable. Note that
the actual memory usage will be the limit multiplied by the
number of threads used by <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;max&minus;pack&minus;size=&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Maximum size of each output
pack file. The size can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;,
&quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. The minimum size allowed is
limited to 1 MiB. If specified, multiple packfiles may be
created, which also prevents the creation of a bitmap index.
The default is unlimited, unless the config variable
<b>pack.packSizeLimit</b> is set. Note that this option may
result in a larger and slower repository; see the discussion
in <b>pack.packSizeLimit</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;b,
&minus;&minus;write&minus;bitmap&minus;index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write a reachability bitmap
index as part of the repack. This only makes sense when used
with <b>&minus;a</b>, <b>&minus;A</b> or <b>&minus;m</b>, as
the bitmaps must be able to refer to all reachable objects.
This option overrides the setting of
<b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>. This option has no effect if
multiple packfiles are created, unless writing a MIDX (in
which case a multi&minus;pack bitmap is created).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;pack&minus;kept&minus;objects</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Include objects in <b>.keep</b>
files when repacking. Note that we still do not delete
<b>.keep</b> packs after <b>pack&minus;objects</b> finishes.
This means that we may duplicate objects, but this makes the
option safe to use when there are concurrent pushes or
fetches. This option is generally only useful if you are
writing bitmaps with <b>&minus;b</b> or
<b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>, as it ensures that the bitmapped
packfile has the necessary objects.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;keep&minus;pack=&lt;pack&minus;name&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exclude the given pack from
repacking. This is the equivalent of having <b>.keep</b>
file on the pack. <b>&lt;pack&minus;name&gt;</b> is the pack
file name without leading directory (e.g.
<b>pack&minus;123.pack</b>). The option could be specified
multiple times to keep multiple packs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;unpack&minus;unreachable=&lt;when&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When loosening unreachable
objects, do not bother loosening any objects older than
<b>&lt;when&gt;</b>. This can be used to optimize out the
write of any objects that would be immediately pruned by a
follow&minus;up <b>git prune</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;k,
&minus;&minus;keep&minus;unreachable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with
<b>&minus;ad</b>, any unreachable objects from existing
packs will be appended to the end of the packfile instead of
being removed. In addition, any unreachable loose objects
will be packed (and their loose counterparts removed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;i,
&minus;&minus;delta&minus;islands</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pass the
<b>&minus;&minus;delta&minus;islands</b> option to
<b>git&minus;pack&minus;objects</b>, see
<b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;g=&lt;factor&gt;,
&minus;&minus;geometric=&lt;factor&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Arrange resulting pack
structure so that each successive pack contains at least
<b>&lt;factor&gt;</b> times the number of objects as the
next&minus;largest pack.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>git
repack</b> ensures this by determining a &quot;cut&quot; of
packfiles that need to be repacked into one in order to
ensure a geometric progression. It picks the smallest set of
packfiles such that as many of the larger packfiles (by
count of objects contained in that pack) may be left
intact.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike other
repack modes, the set of objects to pack is determined
uniquely by the set of packs being
&quot;rolled&minus;up&quot;; in other words, the packs
determined to need to be combined in order to restore a
geometric progression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>&minus;&minus;unpacked</b> is specified, loose objects
are implicitly included in this &quot;roll&minus;up&quot;,
without respect to their reachability. This is subject to
change in the future. This option (implying a drastically
different repack mode) is not guaranteed to work with all
other combinations of option to <b>git repack</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When writing a
multi&minus;pack bitmap, <b>git repack</b> selects the
largest resulting pack as the preferred pack for object
selection by the MIDX (see
<b>git-multi-pack-index</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;m,
&minus;&minus;write&minus;midx</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write a multi&minus;pack index
(see <b>git-multi-pack-index</b>(1)) containing the
non&minus;redundant packs.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various
configuration variables affect packing, see
<b>git-config</b>(1) (search for &quot;pack&quot; and
&quot;delta&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
command passes
<b>&minus;&minus;delta&minus;base&minus;offset</b> option to
<i>git pack&minus;objects</i>; this typically results in
slightly smaller packs, but the generated packs are
incompatible with versions of Git older than version 1.4.4.
If you need to share your repository with such ancient Git
versions, either directly or via the dumb http protocol,
then you need to set the configuration variable
<b>repack.UseDeltaBaseOffset</b> to &quot;false&quot; and
repack. Access from old Git versions over the native
protocol is unaffected by this option as the conversion is
performed on the fly as needed in that case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Delta
compression is not used on objects larger than the
<b>core.bigFileThreshold</b> configuration variable and on
files with the attribute <b>delta</b> set to false.</p>
