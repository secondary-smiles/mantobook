<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DjVu &minus;
DjVu and DjVuLibre.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although the
Internet has given us a worldwide infrastructure on which to
build the universal library, much of the world knowledge,
history, and literature is still trapped on paper in the
basements of the world&rsquo;s traditional libraries. Many
libraries and content owners are in the process of
digitizing their collections. While many such efforts
involve the painstaking process of converting paper
documents to computer-friendly form, such as
<small>SGML</small> based formats, the high cost of such
conversions limits their extent. Scanning documents, and
distributing the resulting images electronically is not only
considerably cheaper, but also more faithful to the original
document because it preserves its visual aspect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Despite the
quickly improving speed of network connections and
computers, the number of scanned document images accessible
on the Web today is relatively small. There are several
reasons for this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first
reason is the relatively high cost of scanning anything else
but unbound sheets in black and white. This problem is
slowly going away with the appearance of fast and low-cost
color scanners with sheet feeders.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
reason is that long-established image compression standards
and file formats have proved inadequate for distributing
scanned documents at high resolution, particularly color
documents. Not only are the file sizes and download times
impractical, the decoding and rendering times are also
prohibitive. A typical magazine page scanned in color at 100
dpi in <small>JPEG</small> would typically occupy 100
<small>KB</small> to 200 <small>KB</small> , but the text
would be hardly readable: insufficient for screen viewing
and totally unacceptable for printing. The same page at 300
dpi would have sufficient quality for viewing and printing,
but the file size would be 300 <small>KB</small> to 1000
<small>KB</small> at best, which is impractical for remote
access. Another major problem is that a fully decoded 300
dpi color images of a letter-size page occupies 24
<small>MB</small> of memory and easily causes disk
swapping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The third
reason is that digital documents are more than just a
collection of individual page images. Pages in a scanned
documents have a natural serial order. Special provision
must be made to ensure that flipping pages be instantaneous
and effortless so as to maintain a good user experience.
Even more important, most existing document formats force
users to download the entire document first before
displaying a chosen page. However, users often want to jump
to individual pages of the document without waiting for the
entire document to download. Efficient browsing requires
efficient random page access, fast sequential page flipping,
and quick rendering. This can be achieved with a combination
of advanced compression, pre-fetching, pre-decoding,
caching, and progressive rendering. DjVu decomposes each
page into multiple components (text, backgrounds, images,
libraries of common shapes...) that may be shared by several
pages and downloaded on demand. All these requirements call
for a very sophisticated but parsimonious control mechanism
to handle on-demand downloading, pre-fetching, decoding,
caching, and progressive rendering of the page images. What
is being considered here is not just a document image
compression technique, but a whole platform for document
delivery.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DjVu is an
image compression technique, a document format, and a
software platform for delivering documents images over the
Internet that fulfills the above requirements.</p>

<h2>DJVU IMAGE COMPRESSION
<a name="DJVU IMAGE COMPRESSION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DjVu image
compression is based on three technologies:</p>

<h2>DjVuPhoto
<a name="DjVuPhoto"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DjVuPhoto, also
known as <small>IW44,</small> is a wavelet-based
continuous-tone image compression technique with progressive
decoding/rendering. It is best used for encoding
photographic images in colors or in shades of gray. Images
are typically half the size as <small>JPEG</small> for the
same distortion.</p>

<h2>DjVuBitonal
<a name="DjVuBitonal"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DjVuBitonal,
also known as <small>JB2,</small> is a bitonal image
compression that takes advantage of repetitions of nearly
identical shapes on the page (such as characters) to
efficiently compress text images. It is best used to
compress black and white images representing text and simple
drawings. A typical 300 dpi page in DjVuBitonal occupies 5
to 25 <small>KB</small> (3 to 8 times better than
<small>TIFF-G4</small> or <small>PDF</small> ).</p>

<h2>DjVuDocument
<a name="DjVuDocument"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DjVuDocument is
a compression technique specifically designed for color
digital documents images containing both pictures and text,
such as a page of a magazine. DjVuDocument represents images
into separately compressed layers. The foreground layer is
usually compressed with DjVu Bitonal and contains the text
and drawings. The background layer is usually compressed
with DjVuPhoto and contains the background texture and the
pictures at lower resolution.</p>

<h2>DJVU DOCUMENT DELIVERY PLATFORM
<a name="DJVU DOCUMENT DELIVERY PLATFORM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DjVu
technology is designed from the ground up to support the
efficient delivery of digital documents over the Internet.
It provides various ways to deal with multi-page documents,
and various ways to enrich the content with hyper-links,
meta-data, searchable text, etc.</p>

<h2>MIME types
<a name="MIME types"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DjVu format
has an official MIME type of <b>image/vnd.djvu</b>, which is
the preferred content-type to be given by http servers for
DjVu files. Unofficial mime types used historically are
<b>image/x.djvu</b> and <b>image/x-djvu</b>, which may still
be encountered. Ideally, clients should be configured to
handle all three.</p>

<h2>Bundled multi-page documents
<a name="Bundled multi-page documents"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Bundled
multi-page DjVu document uses a single file to represent the
entire document. This single file contains all the pages as
well as ancillary information (e.g. the page directory, data
shared by several pages, thumbnails, etc.). Using a single
file format is very convenient for storing documents or for
sending email attachments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you type
the <small>URL</small> of a multi-page document, the DjVu
browser plugin starts downloading the whole file, but
displays the first page as soon as it is available. You can
immediately navigate to other pages using the DjVu toolbar.
Suppose however that the document is stored on a remote web
server. You can easily access the first page and see that
this is not the document you wanted. Although you will never
display the other pages the browser is transferring data for
these pages and is wasting the bandwidth of your server (and
the bandwidth of the Internet too). You could also see the
summary of the document on the first page and jump to page
100. But page 100 cannot be displayed until data for pages 1
to 99 has been received. You may have to wait for the
transmission of unnecessary page data. This second problem
(the unnecessary wait) can be solved using the
&lsquo;&lsquo;byte serving&rsquo;&rsquo; options of the
<small>HTTP/1.1</small> protocol. This option has to be
supported by the web server, the proxies, the caches and the
browser. Byte serving however does not solve the first
problem (the waste of bandwidth).</p>

<h2>Indirect multi-page documents
<a name="Indirect multi-page documents"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Indirect
multi-page DjVu documents solve both problems. An indirect
multi-page DjVu document is composed of several files. The
main file is named the index file. You can browse a document
using the <small>URL</small> of the index file, just like
you do with a bundled multi-page document. The index file
however is very small. It simply contains the document
directory and the <small>URLs</small> of secondary files
containing the page data. When you browse an indirect
multi-page document, the browser only accesses data for the
pages you are viewing. This can be done at a reasonable
speed because the browser maintains a cache of pages and
sometimes pre-fetches a few pages ahead of the current page.
This model uses the web serving bandwidth much more
effectively. It also eliminates unnecessary delays when
jumping ahead to pages located anywhere in a long
document.</p>

<h2>Annotations
<a name="Annotations"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Every DjVu
image optionally includes so-called annotation chunks. The
annotation chunk is often used to define hyper-links to
other document pages or to arbitrary web pages. Annotation
chunks can also be used for other purposes such as setting
the initial viewing mode of a page, defining highlighted
zones, or storing arbitrary meta-data about the page or the
document.</p>

<h2>Hidden text
<a name="Hidden text"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Every DjVu
image optionally includes a hidden text layer that
associated graphical features with the corresponding text.
The hidden text layer is usually generated by running an
Optical Character Recognition software. This textual
information provides for indexing DjVu documents and
copying/pasting text from DjVu page images.</p>

<h2>Thumbnails
<a name="Thumbnails"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DjVu documents
sometimes contain pre-computed page thumbnails.</p>

<h2>Outline
<a name="Outline"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DjVu documents
sometimes contain a navigation chunk containing an outline,
that is, a hierarchical table of contents with pointers to
the corresponding document pages.</p>

<h2>DJVUZONE AND DJVULIBRE
<a name="DJVUZONE AND DJVULIBRE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DjVu
technology was initially created by a few researchers in
AT&amp;T Labs between 1995 and 1999. Lizardtech, Inc. then
obtained a commercial license from AT&amp;T and continued
the development. The current owner of the DjVu commercial
rights is Cuminas (
<b>https://www.cuminas.jp/en/about_djvu</b> ), offers
solutions for producing and distributing documents using the
DjVu technology, as well as a DjVu viewer packaged as a
Chrome extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DjVu.org
web site ( <b>http://www.djvu.org</b> ) is managed by the
few AT&amp;T Labs researchers who created the DjVu
technology in the first place. We promote the DjVu
technology by providing an independent source of information
about DjVu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Understanding
how little room there is for a proprietary document format,
Lizardtech released the DjVu Reference Library under the
<small>GNU</small> Public License in December 2000. This
library entirely defines the compression format and the
elementary codecs. Six month later, Lizardtech released an
updated DjVu Reference Library as well as the source code of
the Unix viewer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These two
releases form the basis of our initial DjVuLibre software.
We modified the build system to comply with the expectations
of the open source community. Various bugs and portability
issues have been fixed. We also tried to make it simpler to
use and install, while preserving the essential structure of
the Lizardtech releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DjVuLibre
software contains the following components:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">DjVuLibre comes
with a variety of specialized encoders, <b>c44</b>(1) for
photographic images, <b>cjb2</b>(1) for bitonal images, and
<b>cpaldjvu</b>(1) for images with few distinct colors.
Although these encoders perform well in their specialized
domain, they cannot handle complex tasks involving
segmentation and multipage encoding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Lizardtech
commercial products (see
<b>http://www.lizardtech.com/solutions/document</b>) can
perform these complex encoding tasks</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another
solution is provided by the compression server at
(<b>http://any2djvu.djvu.org</b>). This machine uses
pre-lizardtech prototype encoders from AT&amp;T Labs and
performs almost as well as the commercial Lizardtech

comes with no guarantee, that nothing is done to ensure that
your documents will remain confidential, and that there is
only one computer working for the whole planet.</p>
