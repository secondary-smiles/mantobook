<h2>DESCRIPTION

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
attempts to address questions that I have been asked several
times, and are easy to answer -- but not by perusing the
documentation. For various reasons, the answers tend to be
thinly distributed across several man pages, making it
difficult to figure out what&rsquo;s going on. Hence, this
man page will attempt to tie together various strands of
thought, providing quick, focused, &quot;How do I do
X?&quot; answers as opposed to lengthy descriptions of the
capabilities and conventions of the btOOL libraries.</p>

<h2>PERL LIBRARY
<a name="PERL LIBRARY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
covers questions that users of &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;, the
Perl component of <b>btOOL</b>, have asked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Why
aren&rsquo;t the BibTeX &quot;month&quot; macros
defined?</b> <br>
Because they&rsquo;re bibliography-specific, and
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; by default doesn&rsquo;t impose any
assumptions about a particular type of database or
data-processing domain on your entries. The problem arises
when you parse entries from a file, say <i>foo.bib</i> that
quite sensibly use the month macros (&quot;jan&quot;,
&quot;feb&quot;, etc.) provided by the BibTeX standard style
files:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$bibfile =
Text::BibTeX::File&minus;&gt;new('foo.bib') # open file <br>
or die &quot;foo.bib: $!\n&quot;; <br>
$entry = Text::BibTeX::Entry&minus;&gt;new($bibfile); #
parse first entry</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using this
code, you might get an &quot;undefined macro&quot; warning
for every entry parsed from <i>foo.bib</i>. Apart from the
superficial annoyance of all those warning messages, the
undefined macros are expanded as empty strings, meaning you
lose any information about them&minus;&minus;&minus;not
good.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You could
always kludge it and forcibly define the month macros
yourself. Prior to release 0.30, this had to be done by
parsing a set of fake entries, but now
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; provides a direct interface to the
underlying macro table. You <i>could</i> just do this before
parsing any entries:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
Text::BibTeX qw(:macrosubs); <br>
# ... <br>
my %month = (jan =&gt; 'January', feb =&gt; 'February', ...
); <br>
add_macro_text ($macro, $value) <br>
while (($macro, $value) = each %month);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But
there&rsquo;s a better way that&rsquo;s more in keeping with
how things are done under BibTeX (where default macros are
defined in the style file): use
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;&rsquo;s object-oriented analogue to
style files, called structure modules.
&quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; provides a structure module,
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot;, that (partially) emulates the
standard style files of BibTeX 0.99, including the
definition of month macros. Structure modules are specified
on a per-file basis by using the &quot;set_structure&quot;
method on a &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; object.
It&rsquo;s quite simple to tell &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot;
that entries from $bibfile are expected to conform to the
&quot;Bib&quot; structure (which is implemented by the
&quot;Text::BibTeX::Bib&quot; module, but you don&rsquo;t
really need to know that):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$bibfile =
Text::BibTeX::File&minus;&gt;new('foo.bib') <br>
or die &quot;foo.bib: $!\n&quot;; <br>
$bibfile&minus;&gt;set_structure ('Bib');</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You probably
shouldn&rsquo;t hardcode the name of a particular structure
in your programs, though, as there will eventually be a
multitude of structure modules to choose from (just as there
are a multitude of BibTeX style files to choose from). My
preferred approach is to make the structure a command-line
option which defaults to &quot;Bib&quot; (since that&rsquo;s
the only structure actually implemented as of this
writing).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>How do I
append to a BibTeX file?</b> <br>
Just open it in append mode, and write entries to it as
usual. Remember, a &quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot; object is
mainly a wrapper around an &quot;IO::File&quot; object, and
the &quot;Text::BibTeX::File::open&quot; method (and thus
&quot;new&quot; as well) is just a front-end to
&quot;IO::File::open&quot;. &quot;IO::File::open&quot;, in
turn, is a front-end either to Perl&rsquo;s builtin
&quot;open&quot; (if called with one argument) or
&quot;sysopen&quot; (two or three arguments). To save you
the trouble of going off and reading all those man pages,
here&rsquo;s the trick: if you pass just a filename to
&quot;Text::BibTeX::File&quot;&rsquo;s &quot;new&quot;
method, then it&rsquo;s treated just like a filename passed
to Perl&rsquo;s builtin &quot;open&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $append_file
=
Text::BibTeX::File&minus;&gt;new(&quot;&gt;&gt;$filename&quot;)
<br>
or die &quot;couldn't open $filename for appending:
$!\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">opens $filename
for appending. If, later on, you have an entry from another
file (say $entry), then you can append it to $append_file by
just writing it as usual:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$entry&minus;&gt;write
($append_file);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;append_entries&quot; in the <i>examples/</i>
subdirectory of the &quot;Text::BibTeX&quot; distribution
for a complete example.</p>
