<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-p &lt;n&gt;, --page

<p style="margin-left:23%;">when starting the viewer,
display page &lt;n&gt; of the document (notes: not all

option only has effect when the document is initially

<p style="margin-left:23%;">when starting the viewer,
display the page of the document containing the named

and even in those cases this option only has effect when the
document is initially loaded).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-r, --reset_focus</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">after sending commands to the
PDF viewer, attempt to reset the input focus to the window
which had focus before the commands were sent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">use (respectively) Adobe Reader
9 (in a new window), Adobe Reader 9 (in a new tab of a
running AR9, if any), Adobe Reader 8, Adobe Reader 7, Adobe
Reader 5, xpdf or evince as the PDF viewer program. Adobe
Reader 9 (in a new window) is the default.</p>

<h2>RATIONALE
<a name="RATIONALE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At certain
points of TeX document preparation, many people repeat a
&quot;edit-compile-view&quot; cycle. Since PDF viewers such
as Adobe&rsquo;s Acrobat Reader
(&quot;<b>acroread</b>&quot;) do not automatically refresh
the display when the PDF file changes, this cycle can be
more cumbersome than desired. The <b>pdfopen</b> program
provides the ability to automate the reloading of the PDF
document when it is changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note: there
seems to be little need for <b>pdfclose</b> under GNU/Linux,
since (unlike the situation for MS windows) <b>acroread</b>
does not lock the PDF file, which would prevent
<b>pdftex</b> (or a DVI to PDF converter) from creating a
new version of the PDF output file. However, <b>pdfclose</b>
is provided in case someone finds it useful.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pdfopen</b>
searches for an instance of the specified (or default) PDF
viewer displaying the specified PDF file. If there is
already an instance of the given viewer displaying the given
file, the viewer is instructed to reload the file. If no
such instance is found, <b>pdfopen</b> attempts to run the
specified viewer on the specified document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
viewer is &quot;<b>acroread</b>&quot;, which could start any
one of a number of versions of Acrobat Reader, depending on
what is installed on your system. However, the commands to
reload the current document vary from one version of
<b>acroread</b> to another; consequently, if you are using a
version of <b>acroread</b> other than AR9, you should
explicitly specify the viewer program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This version of
<b>pdfopen</b> accepts the following viewer options: <i><br>
ar9</i>, <i>ar9-tab</i>, <i>ar8</i>, <i>ar7</i>, <i>ar5</i>,
<i>xpdf</i>, and <i>evince</i>. <br>
The difference between <i>ar9</i> and <i>ar9-tab</i> is
significant when there is no instance of AR9 already
displaying the requested document. In this situation, while
<i>ar9</i> will request <b>acroread</b> to create a new
instance of <b>acroread</b> (and thus open a new window) by
using the <b>-openInNewInstance</b> argument, <i>ar9-tab</i>
starts <b>acroread</b> without this argument; if there is
already an instance of <b>acroread</b> running, a new tab
will be opened in an existing window.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pdfclose</b>
searches for one of the above PDF viewers displaying the
given file and instructs the viewer to &quot;close&quot; the
window. In most cases, the PDF viewer continues to run,
possibly now displaying just a blank window. (This behaviour
varies somewhat from one PDF viewer to another.)</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY AND AVAILABILITY
<a name="PORTABILITY AND AVAILABILITY"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These programs
have been tested on Slackware64 Version 14.1 and a few other
versions / distributions of GNU/Linux. The code is
reasonably generic and should work out of the box using most
recent X11 implementations. (Reports to the contrary are
welcome, particularly if they come with robust fixes.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These programs
are designed for X11-based systems. If you somehow find
compiled versions of these programs on a system using
another window system, they are very unlikely to be of any
use to you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Source and
binaries of the programs can be downloaded from
CTAN://support/xpdfopen/ (e.g.,
http://mirror.ctan.org/support/xpdfopen).</p>

<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you use
<i>ar9-tab</i> to reload the PDF document and the instance
of <b>acroread</b> with the given document is currently
displaying some other document, the command causes your
document to be displayed, but not reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pdfopen</b>
works by looking for a window with a name (window title)
matching that expected for the given viewer and document. If
for some reason your viewer&rsquo;s window name is not as
expected, <b>pdfopen</b> may not work for you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With at least
AR9 and some window managers, using <b>pdfopen</b> to reload
the document gives focus to the <b>acroread</b> window, even
though the mouse cursor is not necessarily in that window.
This can be annoying. The <b>-reset_focus</b> option can be
used to deal with this problem.</p>

<a name="AUTHOR"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This manual
page was written by Jim Diamond
&lt;Jim.Diamond@acadiau.ca&gt;. I am the current maintainer
of the X11 versions of <b>pdfopen</b> and <b>pdfclose</b>.
Report any bugs you find to me. Feature enhancement requests
are welcome, coded enhancements even more so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Past authors:
Fabrice Popineau wrote the MS-windows versions of
<b>pdfopen</b> and <b>pdfclose</b> upon which these programs
were originally based. Taco Hoekwater created the GNU/Linux
versions, up to Version 0.61 (including some documentation
which inspired parts of this man page). Peter Breitenlohner
has contributed both code and suggestions to versions later
than 0.61.</p>
