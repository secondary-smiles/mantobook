<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After splitting
a name into its components parts (represented as a
&quot;bt_name&quot; structure), you often want to put it
back together again as a single string in a consistent way.
<b>btparse</b> provides a very flexible way to do this,
generally in two stages: first, you create a &quot;name
format&quot; which describes how to put the tokens and parts
of any name back together, and then you apply the format to
a particular name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The &quot;name
format&quot; is encapsulated in a &quot;bt_name_format&quot;
structure, which is created with
&quot;bt_create_name_format()&quot;. This function includes
some clever trickery that means you can usually get away
with calling it alone, and not need to do any customization
of the format. If you do need to customize the format,
though, &quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot; and
&quot;bt_set_format_options()&quot; provide that
capability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The format
controls the following:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>which name parts are printed, and in what order (e.g.
&quot;first von last jr&quot;, or &quot;von last jr
first&quot;)</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>the text that precedes and follows each part (e.g. if
the first name follows the last name, you probably want a
comma before the &lsquo;first&rsquo; part: &quot;Smith,
John&quot; rather than &quot;Smith John&quot;)</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>the text that precedes and follows each token (e.g. if
the first name is abbreviated, you may want a period after
each token: &quot;J. R. Smith&quot; rather than &quot;J R
Smith&quot;)</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>the method used to join the tokens of each part
together</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>the method used to join each part to the following
part</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of these
except the list of parts to format are kept in arrays
indexed by name part: for example, the structure has a
field</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">char *
post_token[BT_MAX_NAMEPARTS]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and
&quot;post_token[BTN_FIRST]&quot; (&quot;BTN_FIRST&quot; is
from the &quot;bt_namepart&quot; &quot;enum&quot;) is the
string to be added after each token in the first
name&minus;&minus;&minus;for example, &quot;.&quot; if the
first name is to be abbreviated in the conventional way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Yet another
&quot;enum&quot;, &quot;bt_joinmethod&quot;, describes the
available methods for joining tokens together. Note that
there are <i>two</i> sets of join methods in a name format:
between tokens within a single part, and between the tokens
of two different parts. The first allows you, for example,
to change &quot;J R Smith&quot; (first name abbreviated with
no post-token text but tokens joined by a space) to &quot;JR
Smith&quot; (the same, but first-name tokens jammed
together). The second is mainly used to ensure that
&quot;von&quot; and &quot;last&quot; name-parts may be
joined with a tie: &quot;de~Roche&quot; rather than &quot;de
Roche&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The token join
methods are: <small><br>
BTJ_MAYTIE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Insert a &quot;discretionary
tie&quot; between tokens. That is, either a space or a
&quot;tie&quot; is inserted, depending on context. (A
&quot;tie,&quot; otherwise known as unbreakable space, is
currently hard-coded as
&quot;~&quot;&minus;&minus;&minus;from TeX.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The format is
then applied to a particular name by
&quot;bt_format_name()&quot;, which returns a new
string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BTJ_SPACE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Always insert a space between
tokens.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BTJ_FORCETIE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Always insert a &quot;tie&quot;
(&quot;~&quot;) between tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BTJ_NOTHING</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Insert nothing between
tokens&minus;&minus;&minus;just jam them together.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tokens are
joined together, and thus the choice of whether to insert a
&quot;discretionary tie&quot; is made, at two places: within
a part and between two parts. Naturally, this only applies
when &quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot; was supplied as the token-join
method; &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; and &quot;BTJ_FORCETIE&quot;
always insert either a space or tie, and
&quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot; always adds nothing between tokens.
Within a part, ties are added after a the first token if it
is less than three characters long, and before the last
token. Between parts, a tie is added only if the preceding
part consisted of single token that was less than three
characters long. In all other cases, spaces are inserted.
(This implementation slavishly follows BibTeX.)</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bt_create_name_format()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">bt_name_format *
bt_create_name_format (char * parts, <br>
boolean abbrev_first)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Creates a name
format for a given set of parts, with variations for the
most common forms of customization&minus;&minus;&minus;the
order of parts and whether to abbreviate the first name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;parts&quot; parameter specifies which parts to include
in a formatted name, as well as the order in which to format
them. &quot;parts&quot; must be a string of four or fewer
characters, each of which denotes one of the four name
parts: for instance, &quot;vljf&quot; means to format all
four parts in &quot;von last jr first&quot; order. No
characters outside of the set &quot;fvlj&quot; are allowed,
and no characters may be repeated. &quot;abbrev_first&quot;
controls whether the &lsquo;first&rsquo; part will be
abbreviated (i.e., only the first letter from each token
will be printed).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
simply setting the list of parts to format and the
&quot;abbreviate&quot; flag for the first name,
&quot;bt_create_name_format()&quot; initializes the entire
format structure so as to minimize the need for further
customizations:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>The &quot;token join
method&quot;&minus;&minus;&minus;what to insert between
tokens of the same part&minus;&minus;&minus;is set to
&quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot; (discretionary tie) for all parts</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>The &quot;part join
method&quot;&minus;&minus;&minus;what to insert after the
final token of a particular part, assuming there are more
parts to come&minus;&minus;&minus;is set to
&quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; for the &lsquo;first&rsquo;,
&lsquo;last&rsquo;, and &lsquo;jr&rsquo; parts. If the
&lsquo;von&rsquo; part is present and immediately precedes
the &lsquo;last&rsquo; part (which will almost always be the
case), &quot;BTJ_MAYTIE&quot; is used to join
&lsquo;von&rsquo; to &lsquo;last&rsquo;; otherwise,
&lsquo;von&rsquo; also gets &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot; for the
inter-part join method.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>The abbreviation flag is set to &quot;FALSE&quot; for
the &lsquo;von&rsquo;, &lsquo;last&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;jr&rsquo; parts; for &lsquo;first&rsquo;, the
abbreviation flag is set to whatever you pass in as
&quot;abbrev_first&quot;.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="17%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>Initially, all &quot;surrounding text&quot; (pre-part,
post-part, pre-token, and post-token) for all parts is set
to the empty string. Then a few tweaks are done, depending
on the &quot;abbrev_first&quot; flag and the order of
tokens. First, if &quot;abbrev_first&quot; is
&quot;TRUE&quot;, the post-token text for first name is set
to &quot;.&quot;&minus;&minus;&minus;this changes &quot;J R
Smith&quot; to &quot;J. R. Smith&quot;, which is usually the
desired form. (If you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> want the periods,
you&rsquo;ll have to set the post-token text yourself with
&quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot;.)</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Then, if
&lsquo;jr&rsquo; is present and immediately after
&lsquo;last&rsquo; (almost always the case), the pre-part
text for &lsquo;jr&rsquo; is set to &quot;, &quot;, and the
inter-part join method for &lsquo;last&rsquo; is set to
&quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot;. This changes &quot;John Smith
Jr&quot; (where the space following &quot;Smith&quot; comes
from formatting the last name with a &quot;BTJ_SPACE&quot;
inter-part join method) to &quot;John Smith, Jr&quot; (where
the &quot;, &quot; is now associated with
&quot;Jr&quot;&minus;&minus;&minus;that way, if there is no
&lsquo;jr&rsquo; part, the &quot;, &quot; will not be
printed.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, if
&lsquo;first&rsquo; is present and immediately follows
either &lsquo;jr&rsquo; or &lsquo;last&rsquo; (which will
usually be the case in &quot;last-name first&quot; formats),
the same sort of trickery is applied: the pre-part text for
&lsquo;first&rsquo; is set to &quot;, &quot;, and the part
join method for the preceding part (either &lsquo;jr&rsquo;
or &lsquo;last&rsquo;) is set to
&quot;BTJ_NOTHING&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">While all these
rules are rather complicated, they mean that you are usually
freed from having to do any customization of the name
format. Certainly this is the case if you only need
&quot;fvlj&quot; and &quot;vljf&quot; part orders, only want
to abbreviate the first name, want periods after abbreviated
tokens, non-breaking spaces in the &quot;right&quot; places,
and commas in the conventional places.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want
something out of the ordinary&minus;&minus;&minus;for
instance, abbreviated tokens jammed together with no
puncuation, or abbreviated last
names&minus;&minus;&minus;you&rsquo;ll need to customize the
name format a bit with &quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot; and
&quot;bt_set_format_options()&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bt_free_name_format()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">void bt_free_name_format
(bt_name_format * format)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Frees a name
format created by &quot;bt_create_name_format()&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bt_set_format_text()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">void bt_set_format_text
(bt_name_format * format, <br>
bt_namepart part, <br>
char * pre_part, <br>
char * post_part, <br>
char * pre_token, <br>
char * post_token)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Allows you to
customize some or all of the surrounding text for a single
name part. Supply &quot;NULL&quot; for any chunk of text
that you don&rsquo;t want to change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For instance,
say you want a name format that will abbreviate first names,
but without any punctuation after the abbreviated tokens.
You could create and customize the format as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">format =
bt_create_name_format (&quot;fvlj&quot;, TRUE); <br>
bt_set_format_text (format, <br>
BTN_FIRST, /* name&minus;part to customize */ <br>
NULL, NULL, /* pre&minus; and post&minus; part text */ <br>
NULL, &quot;&quot;); /* empty string for post&minus;token
*/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Without the
&quot;bt_set_format_text()&quot; call, &quot;format&quot;
would result in names formatted like &quot;J. R.
Smith&quot;. After setting the post-token text for first
names to &quot;&quot;, this name would become &quot;J R
Smith&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bt_set_format_options()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">void bt_set_format_options
(bt_name_format * format, <br>
bt_namepart part, <br>
boolean abbrev, <br>
bt_joinmethod join_tokens, <br>
bt_joinmethod join_part)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Allows further
customization of a name format: you can set the abbreviation
flag and the two token-join methods. Alas, there is no
mechanism for leaving a value unchanged; you must set
everything with &quot;bt_set_format_options()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
let&rsquo;s say that just dropping periods from abbreviated
tokens in the first name isn&rsquo;t enough; you
<i>really</i> want to save space by jamming the abbreviated
tokens together: &quot;JR Smith&quot; rather than &quot;J R
Smith&quot; Assuming the two calls in the above example have
been done, the following will finish the job:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">bt_set_format_options
(format, BTN_FIRST, <br>
TRUE, /* keep same value for abbrev flag */ <br>
BTJ_NOTHING, /* jam tokens together */ <br>
BTJ_SPACE); /* space after final token of part */</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that we
unfortunately had to know (and supply) the current values
for the abbreviation flag and post-part join method, even
though we were only setting the intra-part join method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bt_format_name()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">char * bt_format_name (bt_name
* name, bt_name_format * format)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Once a name
format has been created and customized to your heart&rsquo;s
content, you can use it to format any number of names that
have been split with &quot;bt_split_name&quot; (see
bt_split_names). Simply pass the name structure and name
format structure, and a newly-allocated string containing
the formatted name will be returned to you. It is your
responsibility to &quot;free()&quot; this string.</p>
