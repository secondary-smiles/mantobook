<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>ndctl
load&minus;keys</i> [&lt;options&gt;]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>load&minus;keys</i> command loads the master key
(<i>kek</i>) and the encrypted passphrases for all NVDIMMs
into the user keyring maintained by the kernel. The command
is expected to be called during initialization and before
the libnvdimm kernel module is loaded, typically from an
initrd. This is typically set up using a modprobe config
that calls the command before module load.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
All key files are expected to be in the format:
nvdimm_&lt;id&gt;_hostname <br>
The '_' character is used to delimit the different
components in the file name. Within the hostname, the '_'
character is allowed since it is the last component of the
file name.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
This command is typically never called directly by a
user.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>&minus;p,
&minus;&minus;key&minus;path=</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Path to where key related
files reside. This parameter is optional and the default
location is /etc/ndctl/keys.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>&minus;t,
&minus;&minus;tpm&minus;handle=</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>Provide a TPM handle
(should be a string such as 0x81000001). If the key path
(/etc/ndctl/keys) contains a file called tpm.handle which
contains the handle string, then this option may be left
out, and the tpm handle will be obtained from the file. If
both are present, then this option will override (but not
overwrite) anything that is in the file.</big></p>

<h2>THEORY OF OPERATION
<a name="THEORY OF OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The Intel
Device Specific Methods (DSM) specification v1.7 and v1.8
[1] introduced the following security management operations:
enable passhprase, update passphrase, unlock DIMM, disable
security, freeze security, secure (crypto) erase, overwrite,
master passphrase enable, master passphrase update, and
master passphrase secure erase.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
security management for NVDIMMs is comprised of two parts.
The front end uses the Linux key management framework
(trusted and encrypted keys [2]) to store the encrypted
passphrases in the kernel&minus;managed keyring. The
interface for this is the <i>keyutils</i> utility which uses
the key management APIs in the Linux kernel. The back end
takes the decrypted payload (which is the DIMM passphrase)
and passes it to the DIMM.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Unlike
other DSMs which are composed by libndctl and sent to the
kernel via an ioctl, the security DSMs are managed through
the <i>security</i> sysfs attribute under the <i>dimm</i>
device. A <i>key&minus;ID</i> is written to the
<i>security</i> attribute and the kernel pulls the
associated key material from the user keyring that is
maintained by the kernel.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
security process begins with the generation of a <i>master
key</i> that is used to seal (encrypt) the passphrase for
the DIMM. There can either be one common <i>master key</i>
that is used to encrypt every DIMM&rsquo;s passphrase, or a
separate key can be generated for each DIMM. The <i>master
key</i> is also referred to as the
<i>key&minus;encryption&minus;key</i> (kek). The <i>kek</i>
can either be generated by the TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
on the system, or alternatively, the <i>System Master
Key</i> can also be used as the <i>kek</i></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>For
testing purposes a user key with randomized payload can also
be used as a <i>kek</i>. See [2] for details. To perform any
security operations, it is expected that the <i>kek</i> has
been added to the kernel&rsquo;s user keyring as shown in
example below:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big># keyctl

675104189 &minus;&minus;alswrv 0 65534 \_ keyring: _uid.0
<br>
680187394 &minus;&minus;alswrv 0 0 \_ trusted:
nvdimm&minus;master</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Before
performing any of the security operations, all the regions
associated with the DIMM in question need to be disabled.
For the <i>overwrite</i> operation, in addition to the
<i>regions</i>, the <i>dimm</i> also needs to be
disabled.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
following sub&minus;sections describe specifics of each
security feature.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>UNLOCK</b>
<br>
Unlock is performed by the kernel, however a preparation
step must happen before the unlock DSM can be issued by the
kernel. It is expected that from the initramfs, a setup
command (ndctl <i>load&minus;keys</i>) is executed before
the libnvdimm module is loaded by modprobe. This command
will inject the <i>kek</i> and the encrypted passphrases
into the kernel&rsquo;s user keyring. During the
<i>probe</i> of the libnvdimm driver, it will:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>1. Check
the security state of the device and see if the DIMM is
locked</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>2. Request
the associated encrypted passphrase from the kernel&rsquo;s
user key ring</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>3. Use the
<i>kek</i> to decrypt the passphrase</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>4. Create
the unlock DSM, copy the decrypted payload into the
DSM</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>5. Issue
the DSM to unlock the DIMM</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>If the
DIMM is already unlocked, the kernel will attempt to
revalidate the passphrase. If we fail to revalidate the
passphrase, the kernel will freeze the security and disallow
any further security configuration changes. A kernel module
parameter is available to override this behavior.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>SETUP
USER PASSPHRASE</b> <br>
To setup the passphrase for a DIMM, it is expected that the
<i>kek</i> to be used is present in the kernel&rsquo;s user
keyring. The <i>kek</i> encrypts the DIMM passphrase using
the <i>enc32</i> key format. The plaintext passphrase is
never provided by or made visible to the user. It is instead
randomly generated by the kernel and userspace does not have
access to it. Upon encryption, a binary blob of the
passphrase is written to the passphrase blob storage
directory (/etc/ndctl/keys). The user is responsible for
backing up the passphrase blobs to a secure
location.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>UPDATE
USER PASSPHRASE</b> <br>
The update user passphrase operation uses the same DSM
command as enable user passphrase. Most of the work is done
on the key management side. The user has the option of
providing a new <i>kek</i> for the new passphrase, but
continuing to use the existing <i>kek</i> is also
acceptable. The following operations are performed for
<i>update&minus;passphrase</i>:</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>1. Remove
the encrypted passphrase from the kernel&rsquo;s user
keyring.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>2. Rename
the passphrase blob to old.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>3. Load
this old passphrase blob into the keyring with an
&quot;old&quot; name.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>4. Create
the new passphrase and encrypt with the
<i>kek</i>.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>5. Send
DSM with the old and new decrypted passphrases.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>6. Remove
old passphrase and the passphrase blob from the
keyring.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>REMOVE
USER PASSPHRASE</b> <br>
The <i>key&minus;ID</i> for the passphrase to be removed is
written to sysfs. The kernel then sends the DSM to disable
security, and the passphrase is then removed from the
keyring, and the associated passphrase blob is
deleted.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>CRYPTO
(SECURE) ERASE</b> <br>
This operation is similar to remove&minus;passphrase. The
kernel issues a WBINVD instruction before and after the
operation to ensure no data corruption from a stale CPU
cache. Use ndctl&rsquo;s sanitize&minus;dimm command with
the &minus;&minus;crypto&minus;erase option to perform this
operation.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>OVERWRITE</b>
<br>
This is invoked using &minus;&minus;overwrite option for
ndctl <i>sanitize&minus;dimm</i>. The overwrite operation
wipes the entire NVDIMM. The operation can take a
significant amount of time. NOTE: When the command returns
successfully, it just means overwrite has been successfully
started, and not that the overwrite is complete.
Subsequently, 'ndctl wait&minus;overwrite&rsquo;can be used
to wait for the NVDIMMs that are performing overwrite. Upon
successful completion of an overwrite, the WBINVD
instruction is issued by the kernel. If both
&minus;&minus;crypto&minus;erase and &minus;&minus;overwrite
options are supplied, then crypto&minus;erase is performed
before overwrite.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>SECURITY
FREEZE</b> <br>
This operation does not require a passphrase. This will
cause any security command other than a status query to be
locked out until the next boot.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>MASTER
PASSPHRASE SETUP, UPDATE, and CRYPTO ERASE</b> <br>
These operations are similar to the user passphrase enable
and update. The only difference is that a different
passphrase is used. The master passphrase has no relation to
the master key (<i>kek</i>) which is used for encryption of
either passphrase.</big></p>
