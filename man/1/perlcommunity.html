<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perlcommunity
&minus; a brief overview of the Perl community</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
aims to provide an overview of the vast perl community,
which is far too large and diverse to provide a detailed
listing. If any specific niche has been forgotten, it is not
meant as an insult but an omission for the sake of
brevity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
community is as diverse as Perl, and there is a large amount
of evidence that the Perl users apply
<small>TMTOWTDI</small> to all endeavors, not just
programming. From websites, to <small>IRC,</small> to
mailing lists, there is more than one way to get involved in
the community.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Where to
Find the Community</b> <br>
There is a central directory for the Perl community:
&lt;https://perl.org&gt; maintained by the Perl Foundation
(&lt;https://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;), which tracks and
provides services for a variety of other community
sites.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Raku</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
sister language, Raku (formerly known as Perl 6), maintains
its own directory of community resources at
&lt;https://raku.org/community/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mailing
Lists and Newsgroups</b> <br>
Perl runs on e&minus;mail; there is no doubt about it. The
Camel book was originally written mostly over e&minus;mail
and today Perl&rsquo;s development is co-ordinated through
mailing lists. The largest repository of Perl mailing lists
is located at &lt;https://lists.perl.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most
Perl-related projects set up mailing lists for both users
and contributors. If you don&rsquo;t see a certain project
listed at &lt;https://lists.perl.org&gt;, check the
particular website for that project. Most mailing lists are
archived at &lt;https://www.nntp.perl.org/&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>IRC</small></b>
<br>
The Perl community has a rather large <small>IRC</small>
presence. For starters, it has its own <small>IRC</small>
network, &lt;irc://irc.perl.org&gt;. General (not
help-oriented) chat can be found at
&lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;. Many other more specific
chats are also hosted on the network. Information about
irc.perl.org is located on the network&rsquo;s website:
&lt;https://www.irc.perl.org&gt;. For a more help-oriented
#perl, check out &lt;irc://irc.libera.chat/#perl&gt;
(webchat &lt;https://web.libera.chat/#perl&gt;). Most
Perl-related channels will be kind enough to point you in
the right direction if you ask nicely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Any large
<small>IRC</small> network (Dalnet, EFnet) is also likely to
have a #perl channel, with varying activity levels.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Websites</b>
<br>
Perl websites come in a variety of forms, but they fit into
two large categories: forums and news websites. There are
many Perl-related websites, so only a few of the
community&rsquo;s largest are mentioned here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>News
sites</i> <br>
&lt;https://perl.com/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Originally run by
O&rsquo;Reilly Media (the publisher of the Camel Book, this
site provides quality articles mostly about technical
details of Perl.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;http://blogs.perl.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Many members of the community
have a Perl-related blog on this site. If you&rsquo;d like
to join them, you can sign up for free.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;https://perl.theplanetarium.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Planet Perl is one of several
aggregators of Perl-related blog feeds.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;https://perlweekly.com/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perl Weekly is a weekly mailing
list that keeps you up to date on conferences, releases and
notable blog posts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Forums</i>
<br>
&lt;https://www.perlmonks.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">PerlMonks is one of the largest
Perl forums, and describes itself as &quot;A place for
individuals to polish, improve, and showcase their Perl
skills.&quot; and &quot;A community which allows everyone to
grow and learn from each other.&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;https://stackoverflow.com/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stack Overflow is a free
question-and-answer site for programmers. It&rsquo;s not
focussed solely on Perl, but it does have an active group of
users who do their best to help people with their Perl
programming questions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;http://prepan.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">PrePAN is used as a place to
discuss modules that you&rsquo;re considering uploading to
the <small>CPAN.</small> You can get feedback on their
design before you upload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>User
Groups</b> <br>
Many cities around the world have local Perl Mongers
chapters. A Perl Mongers chapter is a local user group which
typically holds regular in-person meetings, both social and
technical; helps organize local conferences, workshops, and
hackathons; and provides a mailing list or other continual
contact method for its members to keep in touch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To find your
local Perl Mongers (or <small>PM</small> as they&rsquo;re
commonly abbreviated) group check the international Perl
Mongers directory at &lt;https://www.pm.org/&gt;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Workshops</b>
<br>
Perl workshops are, as the name might suggest, workshops
where Perl is taught in a variety of ways. At the workshops,
subjects range from a beginner&rsquo;s introduction (such as
the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop&rsquo;s &quot;Zero To
Perl&quot;) to much more advanced subjects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
several great resources for locating workshops: the websites
mentioned above, the calendar mentioned below, and the
<small>YAPC</small> Europe website,
&lt;http://www.yapceurope.org/&gt;, which is probably the
best resource for European Perl events.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Hackathons</b>
<br>
Hackathons are a very different kind of gathering where Perl
hackers gather to do just that, hack nonstop for an extended
(several day) period on a specific project or projects.
Information about hackathons can be located in the same
place as information about workshops as well as in
&lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
never been to a hackathon, here are a few basic things you
need to know before attending: have a working laptop and
know how to use it; check out the involved projects
beforehand; have the necessary version control client; and
bring backup equipment (an extra <small>LAN</small> cable,
additional power strips, etc.) because someone will
forget.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Conventions</b>
<br>
Perl had two major annual conventions: The Perl Conference
(now part of <small>OSCON</small> ), put on by
O&rsquo;Reilly, and Yet Another Perl Conference or
<small>YAPC</small> (pronounced yap-see), which is localized
into several regional YAPCs (North America, Europe, Asia) in
a stunning grassroots display by the Perl community.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In 2016,
<small>YAPC</small> was rebranded as The Perl Conference
again. It is now referred to as The Perl and Raku
Conference.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>OSCON</small>
had been discontinued.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more
information about either conference, check out their
respective web pages:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An additional
conference franchise with a large Perl portion was the Open
Source Developers Conference or <small>OSDC.</small> First
held in Australia, it also spread to Israel and France. More
information can be found at: &lt;http://www.osdc.org.il&gt;
for Israel, and &lt;http://www.osdc.fr/&gt; for France.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Calendar of
Perl Events</b> <br>
The Perl Review, &lt;http://www.theperlreview.com&gt;
maintains a website and Google calendar for tracking
workshops, hackathons, Perl Mongers meetings, and other
events. A view of this calendar is available at
&lt;https://www.perl.org/events.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not every event
or Perl Mongers group is on that calendar, so don&rsquo;t
lose heart if you don&rsquo;t see yours posted. To have your
event or group listed, contact brian d foy
(brian@theperlreview.com).</p>
