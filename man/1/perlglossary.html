<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A glossary of
terms (technical and otherwise) used in the Perl
documentation, derived from the Glossary of <i>Programming
Perl</i>, Fourth Edition. Words or phrases in bold are
defined elsewhere in this glossary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other useful
sources include the Unicode Glossary
&lt;http://unicode.org/glossary/&gt;, the Free On-Line
Dictionary of Computing &lt;http://foldoc.org/&gt;, the
Jargon File &lt;http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/&gt;, and
Wikipedia &lt;http://www.wikipedia.org/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A</b> <br>
accessor methods</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>method</b> used to
indirectly inspect or update an <b>object</b>Xs state (its
<b>instance variables</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">actual arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <b>scalar values</b> that
you supply to a <b>function</b> or <b>subroutine</b> when
you call it. For instance, when you call
&quot;power(&quot;puff&quot;)&quot;, the string
&quot;puff&quot; is the actual argument. See also
<b>argument</b> and <b>formal arguments</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">address operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some languages work directly
with the memory addresses of values, but this can be like
playing with fire. Perl provides a set of asbestos gloves
for handling all memory management. The closest to an
address operator in Perl is the backslash operator, but it
gives you a <b>hard reference</b>, which is much safer than
a memory address.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">algorithm</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A well-defined sequence of
steps, explained clearly enough that even a computer could
do them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">alias</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A nickname for something, which
behaves in all ways as though youXd used the original name
instead of the nickname. Temporary aliases are implicitly
created in the loop variable for &quot;foreach&quot; loops,
in the $_ variable for &quot;map&quot; or &quot;grep&quot;
operators, in $a and $b during &quot;sort&quot;Xs comparison
function, and in each element of @_ for the <b>actual
arguments</b> of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are
explicitly created in <b>packages</b> by <b>importing</b>
symbols or by assignment to <b>typeglobs</b>. Lexically
scoped aliases for package variables are explicitly created
by the &quot;our&quot; declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">alphabetic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The sort of characters we put
into words. In Unicode, this is all letters including all
ideographs and certain diacritics, letter numbers like Roman
numerals, and various combining marks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">alternatives</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A list of possible choices from
which you may select only one, as in, XWould you like door
A, B, or C?X Alternatives in regular expressions are
separated with a single vertical bar: &quot;|&quot;.
Alternatives in normal Perl expressions are separated with a
double vertical bar: &quot;||&quot;. Logical alternatives in
<b>Boolean</b> expressions are separated with either
&quot;||&quot; or &quot;or&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">anonymous</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Used to describe a
<b>referent</b> that is not directly accessible through a
named <b>variable</b>. Such a referent must be indirectly
accessible through at least one <b>hard reference</b>. When
the last hard reference goes away, the anonymous referent is
destroyed without pity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">application</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A bigger, fancier sort of
<b>program</b> with a fancier name so people donXt realize
they are using a program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">architecture</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The kind of computer youXre
working on, where one Xkind of computerX means all those
computers sharing a compatible machine language. Since Perl
programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable
images, a Perl program is much less sensitive to the
architecture itXs running on than programs in other
languages, such as C, that are <b>compiled</b> into machine
code. See also <b>platform</b> and <b>operating
system</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">argument</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A piece of data supplied to a
<b>program</b>, <b>subroutine</b>, <b>function</b>, or
<b>method</b> to tell it what itXs supposed to do. Also
called a XparameterX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>ARGV</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the array
containing the <b>argument vector</b> from the command line.
If you use the empty &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; operator,
&quot;ARGV&quot; is the name of both the <b>filehandle</b>
used to traverse the arguments and the <b>scalar</b>
containing the name of the current input file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">arithmetical operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>symbol</b> such as
&quot;+&quot; or &quot;/&quot; that tells Perl to do the
arithmetic you were supposed to learn in grade school.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An ordered sequence of
<b>values</b>, stored such that you can easily access any of
the values using an <i>integer subscript</i> that specifies
the valueXs <b>offset</b> in the sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">array context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An archaic expression for what
is more correctly referred to as <b>list context</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Artistic License</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The open source license that
Larry Wall created for Perl, maximizing PerlXs usefulness,
availability, and modifiability. The current version is 2.
(&lt;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic&minus;license.php&gt;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>ASCII</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The American Standard Code for
Information Interchange (a 7&minus;bit character set
adequate only for poorly representing English text). Often
used loosely to describe the lowest 128 values of the
various <small>ISO&minus;8859&minus;X</small> character
sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8&minus;bit codes
best described as half <small>ASCII.</small> See also
<b>Unicode</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">assertion</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A component of a <b>regular
expression</b> that must be true for the pattern to match
but does not necessarily match any characters itself. Often
used specifically to mean a <b>zero-width</b> assertion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">assignment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>operator</b> whose
assigned mission in life is to change the value of a
<b>variable</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">assignment operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Either a regular
<b>assignment</b> or a compound <b>operator</b> composed of
an ordinary assignment and some other operator, that changes
the value of a variable in place; that is, relative to its
old value. For example, &quot;$a += 2&quot; adds 2 to
$a.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">associative array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See <b>hash</b>. Please. The
term associative array is the old Perl 4 term for a
<b>hash</b>. Some languages call it a dictionary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">associativity</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Determines whether you do the
left <b>operator</b> first or the right <b>operator</b>
first when you have <small>XA</small> <b>operator</b> B
<b>operator</b> <small>CX,</small> and the two operators are
of the same precedence. Operators like &quot;+&quot; are
left associative, while operators like &quot;**&quot; are
right associative. See Camel chapter 3, XUnary and Binary
OperatorsX for a list of operators and their
associativity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">asynchronous</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Said of events or activities
whose relative temporal ordering is indeterminate because
too many things are going on at once. Hence, an asynchronous
event is one you didnXt know when to expect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">atom</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>regular expression</b>
component potentially matching a <b>substring</b> containing
one or more characters and treated as an indivisible
syntactic unit by any following <b>quantifier</b>. (Contrast
with an <b>assertion</b> that matches something of <b>zero
width</b> and may not be quantified.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">atomic operation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When Democritus gave the word
XatomX to the indivisible bits of matter, he meant literally
something that could not be cut: <i>X&minus;</i> (not) +
<i>&minus;XXXXX</i> (cuttable). An atomic operation is an
action that canXt be interrupted, not one forbidden in a
nuclear-free zone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">attribute</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A new feature that allows the
declaration of <b>variables</b> and <b>subroutines</b> with
modifiers, as in &quot;sub foo : locked method&quot;. Also
another name for an <b>instance variable</b> of an
<b>object</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autogeneration</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A feature of <b>operator
overloading</b> of <b>objects</b>, whereby the behavior of
certain <b>operators</b> can be reasonably deduced using
more fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded
operators will often have the same relationships as the
regular operators. See Camel chapter 13, XOverloadingX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autoincrement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To add one to something
automatically, hence the name of the &quot;++&quot;
operator. To instead subtract one from something
automatically is known as an XautodecrementX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autoload</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To load on demand. (Also called
XlazyX loading.) Specifically, to call an
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; subroutine on behalf of an undefined
subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autosplit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To split a string
automatically, as the <i>Xa</i> <b>switch</b> does when
running under <i>Xp</i> or <i>Xn</i> in order to emulate
<b>awk</b>. (See also the &quot;AutoSplit&quot; module,
which has nothing to do with the &quot;Xa&quot; switch but a
lot to do with autoloading.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">autovivification</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A Graeco-Roman word meaning Xto
bring oneself to lifeX. In Perl, storage locations
(<b>lvalues</b>) spontaneously generate themselves as
needed, including the creation of any <b>hard reference</b>
values to point to the next level of storage. The assignment
&quot;$a[5][5][5][5][5] = &quot;quintet&quot;&quot;
potentially creates five scalar storage locations, plus four
references (in the first four scalar locations) pointing to
four new anonymous arrays (to hold the last four scalar
locations). But the point of autovivification is that you
donXt have to worry about it.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>B</b> <br>
backreference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A substring <b>captured</b> by
a subpattern within unadorned parentheses in a <b>regex</b>.
Backslashed decimal numbers (&quot;\1&quot;, &quot;\2&quot;,
etc.) later in the same pattern refer back to the
corresponding subpattern in the current match. Outside the
pattern, the numbered variables ($1, $2, etc.) continue to
refer to these same values, as long as the pattern was the
last successful match of the current <b>dynamic
scope</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">backtracking</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The practice of saying, XIf I
had to do it all over, IXd do it differently,X and then
actually going back and doing it all over differently.
Mathematically speaking, itXs returning from an unsuccessful
recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when
it attempts to match patterns with a <b>regular
expression</b>, and its earlier attempts donXt pan out. See
the section XThe Little Engine That /Couldn(nXt)X in Camel
chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">backward compatibility</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Means you can still run your
old program because we didnXt break any of the features or
bugs it was relying on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bareword</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A word sufficiently ambiguous
to be deemed illegal under &quot;use strict 'subs'&quot;. In
the absence of that stricture, a bareword is treated as if
quotes were around it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">base class</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A generic <b>object</b> type;
that is, a <b>class</b> from which other, more specific
classes are derived genetically by <b>inheritance</b>. Also
called a XsuperclassX by people who respect their
ancestors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">big-endian</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From Swift: someone who eats
eggs big end first. Also used of computers that store the
most significant <b>byte</b> of a word at a lower byte
address than the least significant byte. Often considered
superior to little-endian machines. See also
<b>little-endian</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">binary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Having to do with numbers
represented in base 2. That means thereXs basically two
numbers: 0 and 1. Also used to describe a file of XnontextX,
presumably because such a file makes full use of all the
binary bits in its bytes. With the advent of <b>Unicode</b>,
this distinction, already suspect, loses even more of its
meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">binary operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>operator</b> that takes
two <b>operands</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bind</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To assign a specific <b>network
address</b> to a <b>socket</b>.</p>

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p>bit</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The
smallest possible unit of information storage. An eighth of
a <b>byte</b> or of a dollar. (The term XPieces of EightX
comes from being able to split the old Spanish dollar into 8
bits, each of which still counted for money. ThatXs why a
25&minus; cent piece today is still Xtwo bitsX.)</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bit shift</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The movement of bits left or
right in a computer word, which has the effect of
multiplying or dividing by a power of 2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bit string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A sequence of <b>bits</b> that
is actually being thought of as a sequence of bits, for
once.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bless</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In corporate life, to grant
official approval to a thing, as in, XThe <small>VP</small>
of Engineering has blessed our WebCruncher project.X
Similarly, in Perl, to grant official approval to a
<b>referent</b> so that it can function as an <b>object</b>,
such as a WebCruncher object. See the &quot;bless&quot;
function in Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">What a <b>process</b> does when
it has to wait for something: XMy process blocked waiting
for the disk.X As an unrelated noun, it refers to a large
chunk of data, of a size that the <b>operating system</b>
likes to deal with (normally a power of 2 such as 512 or
8192). Typically refers to a chunk of data thatXs coming
from or going to a disk file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BLOCK</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A syntactic construct
consisting of a sequence of Perl <b>statements</b> that is
delimited by braces. The &quot;if&quot; and
&quot;while&quot; statements are defined in terms of
<i>&quot;BLOCK&quot;</i>s, for instance. Sometimes we also
say XblockX to mean a lexical scope; that is, a sequence of
statements that acts like a <i>&quot;BLOCK&quot;</i>, such
as within an &quot;eval&quot; or a file, even though the
statements arenXt delimited by braces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">block buffering</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A method of making input and
output efficient by passing one <b>block</b> at a time. By
default, Perl does block buffering to disk files. See
<b>buffer</b> and <b>command buffering</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Boolean</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A value that is either
<b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Boolean context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special kind of <b>scalar
context</b> used in conditionals to decide whether the
<b>scalar value</b> returned by an expression is <b>true</b>
or <b>false</b>. Does not evaluate as either a string or a
number. See <b>context</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">breakpoint</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A spot in your program where
youXve told the debugger to stop <b>execution</b> so you can
poke around and see whether anything is wrong yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">broadcast</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To send a <b>datagram</b> to
multiple destinations simultaneously.</p>

<p><small>BSD</small></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>A psychoactive drug, popular in the X80s, probably
developed at <small>UC</small> Berkeley or thereabouts.
Similar in many ways to the prescription-only medication
called XSystem <small>VX,</small> but infinitely more
useful. (Or, at least, more fun.) The full chemical name is
XBerkeley Standard DistributionX.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bucket</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A location in a <b>hash
table</b> containing (potentially) multiple entries whose
keys XhashX to the same hash value according to its hash
function. (As internal policy, you donXt have to worry about
it unless youXre into internals, or policy.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">buffer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A temporary holding location
for data. Data that are <b>Block buffering</b> means that
the data is passed on to its destination whenever the buffer
is full. <b>Line buffering</b> means that itXs passed on
whenever a complete line is received. <b>Command
buffering</b> means that itXs passed every time you do a
&quot;print&quot; command (or equivalent). If your output is
unbuffered, the system processes it one byte at a time
without the use of a holding area. This can be rather
inefficient.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">built-in</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>function</b> that is
predefined in the language. Even when hidden by
<b>overriding</b>, you can always get at a built&minus; in
function by <b>qualifying</b> its name with the
&quot;CORE::&quot; pseudopackage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bundle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A group of related modules on
<b><small>CPAN</small></b> . (Also sometimes refers to a
group of command-line switches grouped into one <b>switch
cluster</b>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">byte</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A piece of data worth eight
<b>bits</b> in most places.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bytecode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A pidgin-like lingo spoken
among Xdroids when they donXt wish to reveal their
orientation (see <b>endian</b>). Named after some similar
languages spoken (for similar reasons) between compilers and
interpreters in the late 20XX century. These languages are
characterized by representing everything as a
nonarchitecture-dependent sequence of bytes.</p>

<p>A language beloved by many for its inside-out
<b>type</b> definitions, inscrutable <b>precedence</b>
rules, and heavy <b>overloading</b> of the function-call
mechanism. (Well, actually, people first switched to C
because they found lowercase identifiers easier to read than
upper.) Perl is written in C, so itXs not surprising that
Perl borrowed a few ideas from it.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cache</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A data repository. Instead of
computing expensive answers several times, compute it once
and save the result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">callback</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>handler</b> that you
register with some other part of your program in the hope
that the other part of your program will <b>trigger</b> your
handler when some event of interest transpires.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">call by reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An
<b>argument</b>&minus;passing mechanism in which the
<b>formal arguments</b> refer directly to the <b>actual
arguments</b>, and the <b>subroutine</b> can change the
actual arguments by changing the formal arguments. That is,
the formal argument is an <b>alias</b> for the actual
argument. See also <b>call by value</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">call by value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An
<b>argument</b>&minus;passing mechanism in which the
<b>formal arguments</b> refer to a copy of the <b>actual
arguments</b>, and the <b>subroutine</b> cannot change the
actual arguments by changing the formal arguments. See also
<b>call by reference</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">canonical</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reduced to a standard form to
facilitate comparison.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">capture variables</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The variablesXsuch as $1 and
$2, and &quot;%+&quot; and %X Xthat hold the text remembered
in a pattern match. See Camel chapter 5, XPattern
MatchingX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">capturing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The use of parentheses around a
<b>subpattern</b> in a <b>regular expression</b> to store
the matched <b>substring</b> as a <b>backreference</b>.
(Captured strings are also returned as a list in <b>list
context</b>.) See Camel chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cargo cult</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Copying and pasting code
without understanding it, while superstitiously believing in
its value. This term originated from preindustrial cultures
dealing with the detritus of explorers and colonizers of
technologically advanced cultures. See <i>The Gods Must Be
Crazy</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">case</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A property of certain
characters. Originally, typesetter stored capital letters in
the upper of two cases and small letters in the lower one.
Unicode recognizes three cases: <b>lowercase</b>
(<b>character property</b> &quot;\p{lower}&quot;),
<b>titlecase</b> (&quot;\p{title}&quot;), and
<b>uppercase</b> (&quot;\p{upper}&quot;). A fourth
casemapping called <b>foldcase</b> is not itself a distinct
case, but it is used internally to implement
<b>casefolding</b>. Not all letters have case, and some
nonletters have case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">casefolding</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Comparing or matching a string
case-insensitively. In Perl, it is implemented with the
&quot;/i&quot; pattern modifier, the &quot;fc&quot;
function, and the &quot;\F&quot; double-quote translation
escape.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">casemapping</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The process of converting a
string to one of the four Unicode <b>casemaps</b>; in Perl,
it is implemented with the &quot;fc&quot;, &quot;lc&quot;,
&quot;ucfirst&quot;, and &quot;uc&quot; functions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">character</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The smallest individual element
of a string. Computers store characters as integers, but
Perl lets you operate on them as text. The integer used to
represent a particular character is called that characterXs
<b>codepoint</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">character class</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A predefined <b>character
class</b> matchable by the &quot;\p&quot; or &quot;\P&quot;

defines a few of its own, too.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">circumfix operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>operator</b> that
surrounds its <b>operand</b>, like the angle operator, or
parentheses, or a hug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">closure</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>anonymous</b> subroutine
that, when a reference to it is generated at runtime, keeps
track of the identities of externally visible <b>lexical
variables</b>, even after those lexical variables have
supposedly gone out of <b>scope</b>. TheyXre called

mathematicians a sense of closure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cluster</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A parenthesized
<b>subpattern</b> used to group parts of a <b>regular
expression</b> into a single <b>atom</b>.</p>

&quot;(??{...})&quot; subpatterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">collating sequence</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The order into which
<b>characters</b> sort. This is used by <b>string</b>
comparison routines to decide, for example, where in this
glossary to put Xcollating sequenceX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">co-maintainer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A person with permissions to
index a <b>namespace</b> in <b><small>PAUSE</small></b> .
Anyone can upload any namespace, but only primary and
co-maintainers get their contributions indexed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">combining character</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any character with the General
Category of Combining Mark (&quot;\p{GC=M}&quot;), which may
be spacing or nonspacing. Some are even invisible. A
sequence of combining characters following a grapheme base
character together make up a single user-visible character

combining characters, and vice versa.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">command</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In <b>shell</b> programming,
the syntactic combination of a program name and its
arguments. More loosely, anything you type to a shell (a
command interpreter) that starts it doing something. Even
more loosely, a Perl <b>statement</b>, which might start
with a <b>label</b> and typically ends with a semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">command buffering</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A mechanism in Perl that lets
you store up the output of each Perl <b>command</b> and then
flush it out as a single request to the <b>operating
system</b>. ItXs enabled by setting the $| ($AUTOFLUSH)
variable to a true value. ItXs used when you donXt want data
sitting around, not going where itXs supposed to, which may
happen because the default on a <b>file</b> or <b>pipe</b>
is to use <b>block buffering</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">command-line arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <b>values</b> you supply
along with a program name when you tell a <b>shell</b> to
execute a <b>command</b>. These values are passed to a Perl
program through @ARGV.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">command name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the program
currently executing, as typed on the command line. In C, the
<b>command</b> name is passed to the program as the first
command-line argument. In Perl, it comes in separately as
$0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">comment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A remark that doesnXt affect
the meaning of the program. In Perl, a comment is introduced
by a &quot;#&quot; character and continues to the end of the

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <b>file</b> (or
<b>string</b>, in the case of &quot;eval&quot;) that is
currently being <b>compiled</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">compile</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The process of turning source
code into a machine-usable form. See <b>compile
phase</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">compile phase</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any time before Perl starts
running your main program. See also <b>run phase</b>.
Compile phase is mostly spent in <b>compile time</b>, but
may also be spent in <b>runtime</b> when &quot;BEGIN&quot;
blocks, &quot;use&quot; or &quot;no&quot; declarations, or
constant subexpressions are being evaluated. The startup and
import code of any &quot;use&quot; declaration is also run
during compile phase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">compiler</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Strictly speaking, a program
that munches up another program and spits out yet another
file containing the program in a Xmore executableX form,
typically containing native machine instructions. The
<i>perl</i> program is not a compiler by this definition,
but it does contain a kind of compiler that takes a program
and turns it into a more executable form (<b>syntax
trees</b>) within the <i>perl</i> process itself, which the
<b>interpreter</b> then interprets. There are, however,
extension <b>modules</b> to get Perl to act more like a
XrealX compiler. See Camel chapter 16, XCompilingX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">compile time</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The time when Perl is trying to
make sense of your code, as opposed to when it thinks it
knows what your code means and is merely trying to do what
it thinks your code says to do, which is <b>runtime</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">composer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A XconstructorX for a
<b>referent</b> that isnXt really an <b>object</b>, like an
anonymous array or a hash (or a sonata, for that matter).
For example, a pair of braces acts as a composer for a hash,
and a pair of brackets acts as a composer for an array. See
the section XCreating ReferencesX in Camel chapter 8,
XReferencesX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">concatenation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The process of gluing one catXs
nose to another catXs tail. Also a similar operation on two

<b>Boolean context</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">connection</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Any <b>class method</b>,
<b>instance</b>, or <b>subroutine</b> that composes,
initializes, blesses, and returns an <b>object</b>.
Sometimes we use the term loosely to mean a
<b>composer</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The surroundings or
environment. The context given by the surrounding code
determines what kind of data a particular <b>expression</b>
is expected to return. The three primary contexts are
<b>list context</b>, <b>scalar</b>, and <b>void context</b>.
Scalar context is sometimes subdivided into <b>Boolean
context</b>, <b>numeric context</b>, <b>string context</b>,
and <b>void context</b>. ThereXs also a XdonXt careX context
(which is dealt with in Camel chapter 2, XBits and PiecesX,
if you care).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">continuation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The treatment of more than one
physical <b>line</b> as a single logical line.
<b>Makefile</b> lines are continued by putting a backslash
before the <b>newline</b>. Mail headers, as defined by
<small>RFC 822,</small> are continued by putting a space or
tab <i>after</i> the newline. In general, lines in Perl do
not need any form of continuation mark, because
<b>whitespace</b> (including newlines) is gleefully ignored.
Usually.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">core dump</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The corpse of a <b>process</b>,
in the form of a file left in the <b>working directory</b>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">C preprocessor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The typical C compilerXs first
pass, which processes lines beginning with &quot;#&quot; for
conditional compilation and macro definition, and does

current definitions. Also known as <i>cpp</i>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cracker</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Someone who breaks security on

channel</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The last <b>filehandle</b> that

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>D</b> <br>
dangling statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A bare, single

them. Perl doesnXt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">datagram</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A packet of data, such as a
<b><small>UDP</small></b> message, that (from the viewpoint
of the programs involved) can be sent independently over the
network. (In fact, all packets are sent independently at the
<b><small>IP</small></b> level, but <b>stream</b> protocols
such as <b><small>TCP</small></b> hide this from your
program.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">data structure</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">How your various pieces of data
relate to each other and what shape they make when you put
them all together, as in a rectangular table or a triangular
tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">data type</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of possible values,
together with all the operations that know how to deal with
those values. For example, a numeric data type has a certain
set of numbers that you can work with, as well as various
mathematical operations that you can do on the numbers, but
would make little sense on, say, a string such as
&quot;Kilroy&quot;. Strings have their own operations, such
as <b>concatenation</b>. Compound types made of a number of
smaller pieces generally have operations to compose and
decompose them, and perhaps to rearrange them.
<b>Objects</b> that model things in the real world often
have operations that correspond to real activities. For
instance, if you model an elevator, your elevator object
might have an &quot;open_door&quot; <b>method</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">declaration</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>assertion</b> that states
something exists and perhaps describes what itXs like,
without giving any commitment as to how or where youXll use
it. A declaration is like the part of your recipe that says,
Xtwo cups flour, one large egg, four or five tadpolesXX See
<b>statement</b> for its opposite. Note that some
declarations also function as statements. Subroutine
declarations also act as definitions if a body is
supplied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">declarator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something that tells your
program what sort of variable youXd like. Perl doesnXt
require you to declare variables, but you can use
&quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;state&quot; to
denote that you want something other than the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">decrement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To subtract a value from a
variable, as in Xdecrement $xX (meaning to remove 1 from its
value) or Xdecrement $x by 3X.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">default</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>value</b> chosen for you
if you donXt supply a value of your own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">defined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Having a meaning. Perl thinks
that some of the things people try to do are devoid of
meaning; in particular, making use of variables that have
never been given a <b>value</b> and performing certain
operations on data that isnXt there. For example, if you try
to read data past the end of a file, Perl will hand you back
an undefined value. See also <b>false</b> and the
&quot;defined&quot; entry in Camel chapter 27,
XFunctionsX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">delimiter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>character</b> or
<b>string</b> that sets bounds to an arbitrarily sized
textual object, not to be confused with a <b>separator</b>
or <b>terminator</b>. XTo delimitX really just means Xto
surroundX or Xto encloseX (like these parentheses are
doing).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dereference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A fancy computer science term
meaning Xto follow a <b>reference</b> to what it points toX.

<p style="margin-left:11%;">derived class</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>class</b> that defines
some of its <b>methods</b> in terms of a more generic class,
called a <b>base class</b>. Note that classes arenXt
classified exclusively into base classes or derived classes:
a class can function as both a derived class and a base
class simultaneously, which is kind of classy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See <b>file descriptor</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">destroy</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To deallocate the memory of a
<b>referent</b> (first triggering its &quot;DESTROY&quot;

<p style="margin-left:11%;">destructor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special <b>method</b> that is
called when an <b>object</b> is thinking about
<b>destroying</b> itself. A Perl programXs
&quot;DESTROY&quot; method doesnXt do the actual
destruction; Perl just <b>triggers</b> the method in case
the <b>class</b> wants to do any associated cleanup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">device</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A whiz-bang hardware gizmo
(like a disk or tape drive or a modem or a joystick or a
mouse) attached to your computer, which the <b>operating
system</b> tries to make look like a <b>file</b> (or a bunch
of files). Under Unix, these fake files tend to live in the

particular instance of opening a directory to read it, until
you close it. See the &quot;opendir&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">discipline</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some people need this and some
people avoid it. For Perl, itXs an old way to say <b>I/O
layer</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dispatch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To send something to its
correct destination. Often used metaphorically to indicate a
transfer of programmatic control to a destination selected
algorithmically, often by lookup in a table of function
<b>references</b> or, in the case of object <b>methods</b>,
by traversing the inheritance tree looking for the most
specific definition for the method.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">distribution</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A standard, bundled release of
a system of software. The default usage implies source code
is included. If that is not the case, it will be called a
Xbinary-onlyX distribution.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dual-lived</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Some modules live both in the
<b>Standard Library</b> and on <b><small>CPAN</small></b> .
These modules might be developed on two tracks as people
modify either version. The trend currently is to untangle
these situations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dweomer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An enchantment, illusion,
phantasm, or jugglery. Said when PerlXs magical
<b>dwimmer</b> effects donXt do what you expect, but rather
seem to be the product of arcane <i>dweomercraft</i>,
sorcery, or wonder working. [From Middle English.]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dwimmer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><small>DWIM</small> is an
acronym for XDo What I MeanX, the principle that something
should just do what you want it to do without an undue
amount of fuss. A bit of code that does XdwimmingX is a
XdwimmerX. Dwimming can require a great deal of
behind-the-scenes magic, which (if it doesnXt stay properly
behind the scenes) is called a <b>dweomer</b> instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dynamic scoping</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Dynamic scoping works over a
<b>dynamic scope</b>, making variables visible throughout
the rest of the <b>block</b> in which they are first used
and in any <b>subroutines</b> that are called by the rest of
the block. Dynamically scoped variables can have their
values temporarily changed (and implicitly restored later)
by a &quot;local&quot; operator. (Compare <b>lexical
scoping</b>.) Used more loosely to mean how a subroutine
that is in the middle of calling another subroutine
XcontainsX that subroutine at <b>runtime</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>E</b> <br>

<b>derived class</b> should behave exactly like its <b>base
class</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">encapsulation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The veil of abstraction
separating the <b>interface</b> from the
<b>implementation</b> (whether enforced or not), which
mandates that all access to an <b>object</b>Xs state be
through <b>methods</b> alone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">endian</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See <b>little-endian</b> and
<b>big-endian</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">en passant</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">execute bit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The special mark that tells the

of <b>literals</b>, <b>variables</b>, <b>operators</b>,
<b>functions</b>, and <b>subroutine</b> calls, not
necessarily in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">extension</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A Perl module that also pulls
in <b>compiled</b> C or C <small>++</small> code. More
generally, any experimental option that can be
<b>compiled</b> into Perl, such as multithreading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>F</b> <br>
false</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Perl, any value that would
look like &quot;&quot; or &quot;0&quot; if evaluated in a
string context. Since undefined values evaluate to
&quot;&quot;, all undefined values are false, but not all
false values are undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fatal error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An uncaught <b>exception</b>,
which causes termination of the <b>process</b> after
printing a message on your <b>standard error</b> stream.
Errors that happen inside an &quot;eval&quot; are not fatal.
Instead, the &quot;eval&quot; terminates after placing the
exception message in the $@ ($EVAL_ERROR) variable. You can
try to provoke a fatal error with the &quot;die&quot;
operator (known as throwing or raising an exception), but
this may be caught by a dynamically enclosing
&quot;eval&quot;. If not caught, the &quot;die&quot; becomes
a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">feeping creaturism</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A spoonerism of Xcreeping
featurismX, noting the biological urge to add just one more
feature to a program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">field</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A single piece of numeric or
string data that is part of a longer <b>string</b>,
<b>record</b>, or <b>line</b>. Variable-width fields are
usually split up by <b>separators</b> (so use
&quot;split&quot; to extract the fields), while fixed-width
fields are usually at fixed positions (so use
&quot;unpack&quot;). <b>Instance variables</b> are also
known as XfieldsX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>FIFO</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">First In, First Out. See also
<b><small>LIFO</small></b> . Also a nickname for a <b>named
pipe</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A named collection of data,
usually stored on disk in a <b>directory</b> in a
<b>filesystem</b>. Roughly like a document, if youXre into
office metaphors. In modern filesystems, you can actually
give a file more than one name. Some files have special
properties, like directories and devices.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">file descriptor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The little number the
<b>operating system</b> uses to keep track of which opened
<b>file</b> youXre talking about. Perl hides the file
descriptor inside a <b>standard I/O</b> stream and then
attaches the stream to a <b>filehandle</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fileglob</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A XwildcardX match on
<b>filenames</b>. See the &quot;glob&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An identifier (not necessarily
related to the real name of a file) that represents a
particular instance of opening a file, until you close it.
If youXre going to open and close several different files in
succession, itXs fine to open each of them with the same
filehandle, so you donXt have to write out separate code to
process each file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">filename</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One name for a file. This name
is listed in a <b>directory</b>. You can use it in an
&quot;open&quot; to tell the <b>operating system</b> exactly
which file you want to open, and associate the file with a
<b>filehandle</b>, which will carry the subsequent identity
of that file in your program, until you close it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">filesystem</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of <b>directories</b> and
<b>files</b> residing on a partition of the disk. Sometimes
known as a XpartitionX. You can change the fileXs name or
even move a file around from directory to directory within a
filesystem without actually moving the file itself, at least
under Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">file test operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A built-in unary operator that
you use to determine whether something is <b>true</b> about
a file, such as &quot;Xo $filename&quot; to test whether
youXre the owner of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">filter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A program designed to take a
<b>stream</b> of input and transform it into a stream of
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">first-come</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The first
<b><small>PAUSE</small></b> author to upload a
<b>namespace</b> automatically becomes the <b>primary
maintainer</b> for that namespace. The Xfirst comeX
permissions distinguish a <b>primary maintainer</b> who was
assigned that role from one who received it
automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">flag</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">We tend to avoid this term
because it means so many things. It may mean a command-line
<b>switch</b> that takes no argument itself (such as PerlXs
&quot;Xn&quot; and &quot;Xp&quot; flags) or, less
frequently, a single-bit indicator (such as the
&quot;O_CREAT&quot; and &quot;O_EXCL&quot; flags used in
&quot;sysopen&quot;). Sometimes informally used to refer to
certain regex modifiers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">floating point</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A method of storing numbers in
Xscientific notationX, such that the precision of the number
is independent of its magnitude (the decimal point
XfloatsX). Perl does its numeric work with floating-point
numbers (sometimes called XfloatsX) when it canXt get away
with using <b>integers</b>. Floating-point numbers are mere
approximations of real numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">flush</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The act of emptying a
<b>buffer</b>, often before itXs full.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>FMTEYEWTK</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Far More Than Everything You
Ever Wanted To Know. An exhaustive treatise on one narrow
topic, something of a super&minus; <b><small>FAQ</small></b>
. See Tom for far more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">foldcase</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The casemap used in Unicode
when comparing or matching without regard to case. Comparing
lower&minus;, title&minus;, or uppercase are all unreliable
due to UnicodeXs complex, one-to-many case mappings.
Foldcase is a <b>lowercase</b> variant (using a partially
decomposed <b>normalization</b> form for certain codepoints)
created specifically to resolve this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fork</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To create a child
<b>process</b> identical to the parent process at its moment
of conception, at least until it gets ideas of its own. A
thread with protected memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">formal arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The generic names by which a
<b>subroutine</b> knows its <b>arguments</b>. In many
languages, formal arguments are always given individual
names; in Perl, the formal arguments are just the elements
of an array. The formal arguments to a Perl program are
$ARGV[0], $ARGV[1], and so on. Similarly, the formal
arguments to a Perl subroutine are $_[0], $_[1], and so on.
You may give the arguments individual names by assigning the
values to a &quot;my&quot; list. See also <b>actual
arguments</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">format</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A specification of how many
spaces and digits and things to put somewhere so that
whatever youXre printing comes out nice and pretty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">freely available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Means you donXt have to pay
money to get it, but the copyright on it may still belong to
someone else (like Larry).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">freely redistributable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Means youXre not in legal
trouble if you give a bootleg copy of it to your friends and
we find out about it. In fact, weXd rather you gave a copy
to all your friends.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">freeware</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Historically, any software that
you give away, particularly if you make the source code
available as well. Now often called <b>open source
software</b>. Recently there has been a trend to use the
term in contradistinction to <b>open source software</b>, to
refer only to free software released under the Free Software
FoundationXs <small>GPL</small> (General Public License),
but this is difficult to justify etymologically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">function</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mathematically, a mapping of
each of a set of input values to a particular output value.
In computers, refers to a <b>subroutine</b> or
<b>operator</b> that returns a <b>value</b>. It may or may
not have input values (called <b>arguments</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">funny character</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Someone like Larry, or one of
his peculiar friends. Also refers to the strange prefixes
that Perl requires as noun markers on its variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>G</b> <br>
garbage collection</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A misnamed featureXit should be
called, Xexpecting your mother to pick up after youX.
Strictly speaking, Perl doesnXt do this, but it relies on a
reference-counting mechanism to keep things tidy. However,
we rarely speak strictly and will often refer to the
reference-counting scheme as a form of garbage collection.
(If itXs any comfort, when your interpreter exits, a XrealX
garbage collector runs to make sure everything is cleaned up
if youXve been messy with circular references and such.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">glob</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Strictly, the shellXs
&quot;*&quot; character, which will match a XglobX of
characters when youXre trying to generate a list of
filenames. Loosely, the act of using globs and similar
symbols to do pattern matching. See also <b>fileglob</b> and
<b>typeglob</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">global</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something you can see from
anywhere, usually used of <b>variables</b> and
<b>subroutines</b> that are visible everywhere in your
program. In Perl, only certain special variables are truly
globalXmost variables (and all subroutines) exist only in
the current <b>package</b>. Global variables can be declared
with &quot;our&quot;. See XGlobal DeclarationsX in Camel
chapter 4, XStatements and DeclarationsX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">global destruction</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <b>garbage collection</b>
of globals (and the running of any associated object
destructors) that takes place when a Perl <b>interpreter</b>
is being shut down. Global destruction should not be
confused with the Apocalypse, except perhaps when it
should.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">glue language</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A language such as Perl that is
good at hooking things together that werenXt intended to be
hooked together.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">granularity</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The size of the pieces youXre
dealing with, mentally speaking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">grapheme</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A graphene is an allotrope of
carbon arranged in a hexagonal crystal lattice one atom
thick. A <b>grapheme</b>, or more fully, a <i>grapheme
cluster string</i> is a single user-visible
<b>character</b>, which may in turn be several characters
(<b>codepoints</b>) long. For example, a carriage return
plus a line feed is a single grapheme but two characters,
while a <small>XXX</small> is a single grapheme but one,
two, or even three characters, depending on
<b>normalization</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">greedy</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>subpattern</b> whose
<b>quantifier</b> wants to match as many things as
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">grep</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Originally from the old Unix
editor command for XGlobally search for a Regular Expression
and Print itX, now used in the general sense of any kind of
search, especially text searches. Perl has a built-in
&quot;grep&quot; function that searches a list for elements
matching any given criterion, whereas the <b>grep</b>(1)
program searches for lines matching a <b>regular
expression</b> in one or more files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">group</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A set of users of which you are
a member. In some operating systems (like Unix), you can
give certain file access permissions to other members of
your group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>H</b> <br>
hacker</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Someone who is brilliantly
persistent in solving technical problems, whether these
involve golfing, fighting orcs, or programming. Hacker is a
neutral term, morally speaking. Good hackers are not to be
confused with evil <b>crackers</b> or clueless <b>script
kiddies</b>. If you confuse them, we will presume that you
are either evil or clueless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">handler</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>subroutine</b> or
<b>method</b> that Perl calls when your program needs to
respond to some internal event, such as a <b>signal</b>, or
an encounter with an operator subject to <b>operator
overloading</b>. See also <b>callback</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hard reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>scalar value</b>
containing the actual address of a <b>referent</b>, such
that the referentXs <b>reference</b> count accounts for it.
(Some hard references are held internally, such as the
implicit reference from one of a <b>typeglob</b>Xs variable
slots to its corresponding referent.) A hard reference is
different from a <b>symbolic reference</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An unordered association of
<b>key</b>/<b>value</b> pairs, stored such that you can
easily use a string <b>key</b> to look up its associated
data <b>value</b>. This glossary is like a hash, where the
word to be defined is the key and the definition is the
value. A hash is also sometimes septisyllabically called an
Xassociative arrayX, which is a pretty good reason for
simply calling it a XhashX instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hash table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A data structure used
internally by Perl for implementing associative arrays
(hashes) efficiently. See also <b>bucket</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">header file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A file containing certain
required definitions that you must include XaheadX of the
rest of your program to do certain obscure operations. A C
header file has a <i>.h</i> extension. Perl doesnXt really
have header files, though historically Perl has sometimes
used translated <i>.h</i> files with a <i>.ph</i> extension.
See &quot;require&quot; in Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX.
(Header files have been superseded by the <b>module</b>
mechanism.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">here document</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">So called because of a similar
construct in <b>shells</b> that pretends that the
<b>lines</b> following the <b>command</b> are a separate
<b>file</b> to be fed to the command, up to some terminating
string. In Perl, however, itXs just a fancy form of
quoting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hexadecimal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A number in base 16, XhexX for
short. The digits for 10 through 15 are customarily
represented by the letters &quot;a&quot; through
&quot;f&quot;. Hexadecimal constants in Perl start with
&quot;0x&quot;. See also the &quot;hex&quot; function in
Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">home directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The directory you are put into
when you log in. On a Unix system, the name is often placed
into $ENV{HOME} or $ENV{LOGDIR} by <i>login</i>, but you can
also find it with
&quot;(get&quot;&quot;pwuid($&lt;))[7]&quot;. (Some
platforms do not have a concept of a home directory.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">host</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The computer on which a program
or other data resides.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">hubris</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Excessive pride, the sort of
thing for which Zeus zaps you. Also the quality that makes
you write (and maintain) programs that other people wonXt
want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue
of a programmer. See also <b>laziness</b> and
<b>impatience</b>.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>I</b> <br>
identifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A legally formed name for most
anything in which a computer program might be interested.
Many languages (including Perl) allow identifiers to start
with an alphabetic character, and then contain alphabetics
and digits. Perl also allows connector punctuation like the
underscore character wherever it allows alphabetics. (Perl
also has more complicated names, like <b>qualified</b>
names.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">impatience</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The anger you feel when the
computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that
donXt just react to your needs, but actually anticipate
them. Or at least that pretend to. Hence, the second great
virtue of a programmer. See also <b>laziness</b> and
<b>hubris</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">implementation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">How a piece of code actually
goes about doing its job. Users of the code should not count
on implementation details staying the same unless they are
part of the published <b>interface</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">import</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To gain access to symbols that
are exported from another module. See &quot;use&quot; in
Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">increment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To increase the value of
something by 1 (or by some other number, if so
specified).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">indexing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In olden days, the act of
looking up a <b>key</b> in an actual index (such as a phone
book). But now it&rsquo;s merely the act of using any kind
of key or position to find the corresponding <b>value</b>,
even if no index is involved. Things have degenerated to the
point that PerlXs &quot;index&quot; function merely locates
the position (index) of one string in another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">indirect filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>expression</b> that
evaluates to something that can be used as a
<b>filehandle</b>: a <b>string</b> (filehandle name), a
<b>typeglob</b>, a typeglob <b>reference</b>, or a low-level
<b><small>IO</small></b> object.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">indirection</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If something in a program isnXt
the value youXre looking for but indicates where the value
is, thatXs indirection. This can be done with either
<b>symbolic references</b> or <b>hard</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">indirect object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In English grammar, a short
noun phrase between a verb and its direct object indicating
the beneficiary or recipient of the action. In Perl,
&quot;print STDOUT &quot;$foo\n&quot;;&quot; can be
understood as Xverb indirect-object objectX, where
&quot;STDOUT&quot; is the recipient of the &quot;print&quot;
action, and &quot;$foo&quot; is the object being printed.
Similarly, when invoking a <b>method</b>, you might place
the invocant in the dative slot between the method and its
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$gollum = new
Pathetic::Creature &quot;Smeagol&quot;; <br>
give $gollum &quot;Fisssssh!&quot;; <br>
give $gollum &quot;Precious!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">indirect object slot</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The syntactic position falling
between a method call and its arguments when using the
indirect object invocation syntax. (The slot is
distinguished by the absence of a comma between it and the
next argument.) &quot;STDERR&quot; is in the indirect object
slot here:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">print STDERR
&quot;Awake! Awake! Fear, Fire, Foes! Awake!\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">infix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>operator</b> that comes
in between its <b>operands</b>, such as multiplication in
&quot;24 * 7&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">inheritance</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">What you get from your
ancestors, genetically or otherwise. If you happen to be a
<b>class</b>, your ancestors are called <b>base classes</b>
and your descendants are called <b>derived classes</b>. See
<b>single inheritance</b> and <b>multiple
inheritance</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">instance</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Short for Xan instance of a
classX, meaning an <b>object</b> of that <b>class</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">instance data</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See <b>instance
variable</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">instance method</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>method</b> of an
<b>object</b>, as opposed to a <b>class method</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>method</b>
whose <b>invocant</b> is an <b>object</b>, not a
<b>package</b> name. Every object of a class shares all the
methods of that class, so an instance method applies to all
instances of the class, rather than applying to a particular
instance. Also see <b>class method</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">instance variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>attribute</b> of an
<b>object</b>; data stored with the particular object rather
than with the class as a whole.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">integer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A number with no fractional
(decimal) part. A counting number, like 1, 2, 3, and so on,
but including 0 and the negatives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">interface</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The services a piece of code
promises to provide forever, in contrast to its
<b>implementation</b>, which it should feel free to change
whenever it likes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">interpolation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The insertion of a scalar or
list value somewhere in the middle of another value, such
that it appears to have been there all along. In Perl,
variable interpolation happens in double-quoted strings and
patterns, and list interpolation occurs when constructing
the list of values to pass to a list operator or other such
construct that takes a <i>&quot;LIST&quot;</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">interpreter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Strictly speaking, a program
that reads a second program and does what the second program
says directly without turning the program into a different
form first, which is what <b>compilers</b> do. Perl is not
an interpreter by this definition, because it contains a
kind of compiler that takes a program and turns it into a
more executable form (<b>syntax trees</b>) within the
<i>perl</i> process itself, which the Perl <b>runtime</b>
system then interprets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">invocant</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The agent on whose behalf a
<b>method</b> is invoked. In a <b>class</b> method, the
invocant is a package name. In an <b>instance</b> method,
the invocant is an object reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">invocation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The act of calling up a deity,
daemon, program, method, subroutine, or function to get it
to do what you think itXs supposed to do. We usually XcallX
subroutines but XinvokeX methods, since it sounds
cooler.</p>

more specific version of the other, generic object:
<small>XA</small> camel is a mammal.X Since the generic
object really only exists in a Platonic sense, we usually
add a little abstraction to the notion of objects and think

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lexical scoping</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Looking at your <i>Oxford
English Dictionary</i> through a microscope. (Also known as
<b>static scoping</b>, because dictionaries donXt change
very fast.) Similarly, looking at variables stored in a
private dictionary (namespace) for each scope, which are
visible only from their point of declaration down to the end
of the lexical scope in which they are declared. XSyn.
<b>static scoping</b>. XAnt. <b>dynamic scoping</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lexical variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>variable</b> subject to
<b>lexical scoping</b>, declared by &quot;my&quot;. Often

set up line buffering on output that is going to the
terminal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">line number</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The number of lines read
previous to this one, plus 1. Perl keeps a separate line
number for each source or input file it opens. The current
source fileXs line number is represented by
&quot;__LINE__&quot;. The current input line number (for the
file that was most recently read via &quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot;)

Linking can generally be static or dynamic, which has
nothing to do with static or dynamic scoping.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">list context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The situation in which an
<b>expression</b> is expected by its surroundings (the code
calling it) to return a list of values rather than a single
value. Functions that want a <i>&quot;LIST&quot;</i> of
arguments tell those arguments that they should produce a
list value. See also <b>context</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">list operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>operator</b> that does
something with a list of values, such as &quot;join&quot; or

an actual <b>value</b> instead of merely representing
possible values as a <b>variable</b> does.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From Swift: someone who eats
eggs little end first. Also used of computers that store the
least significant <b>byte</b> of a word at a lower byte
address than the most significant byte. Often considered
superior to big-endian machines. See also
<b>big-endian</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">local</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Not meaning the same thing
everywhere. A global variable in Perl can be localized

to a loop (or roller coaster) so that loop control
statements can talk about which loop they want to
control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lowercase</p>

Letters, Letter Numbers, some Other Symbols, and one
Combining Mark.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lvaluable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Able to serve as an
<b>lvalue</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lvalue</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Term used by language lawyers
for a storage location you can assign a new <b>value</b> to,
such as a <b>variable</b> or an element of an <b>array</b>.
The XlX is short for XleftX, as in the left side of an
assignment, a typical place for lvalues. An <b>lvaluable</b>
function or expression is one to which a value may be
assigned, as in &quot;pos($x) = 10&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lvalue modifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An adjectival pseudofunction

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>M</b> <br>
magic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Technically speaking, any extra

as well as numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">magical variables</p>

side effects when you access them or assign to them. For
example, in Perl, changing elements of the %ENV array also

subprocesses will use. Reading the $! variable gives you the
current system error number or message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Makefile</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A file that controls the
compilation of a program. Perl programs donXt usually need a
<b>Makefile</b> because the Perl compiler has plenty of

<p style="margin-left:11%;">memory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This always means your main
memory, not your disk. Clouding the issue is the fact that
your machine may implement <b>virtual</b> memory; that is,
it will pretend that it has more memory than it really does,
and itXll use disk space to hold inactive bits. This can
make it seem like you have a little more memory than you
really do, but itXs not a substitute for real memory. The
best thing that can be said about virtual memory is that it
lets your performance degrade gradually rather than suddenly
when you run out of real memory. But your program can die
when you run out of virtual memory, tooXif you havenXt
thrashed your disk to death first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">metacharacter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>character</b> that is
<i>not</i> supposed to be treated normally. Which characters
are to be treated specially as metacharacters varies greatly

all the double-quote metacharacters plus some extra ones of
their own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">metasymbol</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something weXd call a

<p style="margin-left:11%;">method</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A kind of action that an

12, XObjectsX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">method resolution order</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The path Perl takes through

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mojibake</p>

value of 012 octal under Unix (but 015 on a Mac), and
represented by &quot;\n&quot; in Perl strings. For Windows

devices like terminals, the single newline gets
automatically translated by your C library into a line feed
and a carriage return, but normally, no translation is

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An <b>expression</b> that
yields a <b>value</b> that an <b>operator</b> operates on.
See also <b>precedence</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">operating system</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special program that runs on
the bare machine and hides the gory details of managing
<b>processes</b> and <b>devices</b>. Usually used in a
looser sense to indicate a particular culture of
programming. The loose sense can be used at varying levels
of specificity. At one extreme, you might say that all
versions of Unix and Unix-lookalikes are the same operating
system (upsetting many people, especially lawyers and other
advocates). At the other extreme, you could say this
particular version of this particular vendorXs operating
system is different from any other version of this or any
other vendorXs operating system. Perl is much more portable
across operating systems than many other languages. See also
<b>architecture</b> and <b>platform</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A gizmo that transforms some
number of input values to some number of output values,
often built into a language with a special syntax or symbol.
A given operator may have specific expectations about what
<b>types</b> of data you give as its arguments
(<b>operands</b>) and what type of data you want back from
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">operator overloading</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A kind of <b>overloading</b>
that you can do on built-in <b>operators</b> to make them
work on <b>objects</b> as if the objects were ordinary
scalar values, but with the actual semantics supplied by the
object class. This is set up with the overload
<b>pragma</b>Xsee Camel chapter 13, XOverloadingX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">options</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See either <b>switches</b> or

value. Same thing as <b>codepoint</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">overloading</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Giving additional meanings to a
symbol or construct. Actually, all languages do overloading
to one extent or another, since people are good at figuring
out things from <b>context</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">overriding</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Hiding or invalidating some
other definition of the same name. (Not to be confused with
<b>overloading</b>, which adds definitions that must be
disambiguated some other way.) To confuse the issue further,
we use the word with two overloaded definitions: to describe
how you can define your own <b>subroutine</b> to hide a
built-in <b>function</b> of the same name (see the section
XOverriding Built-in FunctionsX in Camel chapter 11,
XModulesX), and to describe how you can define a replacement
<b>method</b> in a <b>derived class</b> to hide a <b>base
class</b>Xs method of the same name (see Camel chapter 12,
XObjectsX).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">owner</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The one user (apart from the
superuser) who has absolute control over a <b>file</b>. A
file may also have a <b>group</b> of users who may exercise
joint ownership if the real owner permits it. See
<b>permission bits</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>P</b> <br>
package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>namespace</b> for global
<b>variables</b>, <b>subroutines</b>, and the like, such
that they can be kept separate from like-named
<b>symbols</b> in other namespaces. In a sense, only the
package is global, since the symbols in the packageXs symbol
table are only accessible from code <b>compiled</b> outside
the package by naming the package. But in another sense, all
package symbols are also globalsXtheyXre just well-organized
globals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A direct <b>connection</b> that
carries the output of one <b>process</b> to the input of
another without an intermediate temporary file. Once the

output stream to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">platform</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The entire hardware and
software context in which a program runs. A program written
in a platform-dependent language might break if you change
any of the following: machine, operating system, libraries,
compiler, or system configuration. The <i>perl</i>
interpreter has to be <b>compiled</b> differently for each
platform because it is implemented in C, but programs
written in the Perl language are largely platform
independent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pointer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>variable</b> in a language

pointers and do in fact contain pointers).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">polymorphism</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">recursion</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The art of defining something

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regular expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A single entity with various

itXs a grammar for a little language in which some strings
are legal and others arenXt. To normal people, itXs a
pattern you can use to find what youXre looking for when it
varies from case to case. PerlXs regular expressions are far
from regular in the theoretical sense, but in regular use
they work quite well. HereXs a regular expression: &quot;/Oh
s.*t./&quot;. This will match strings like X&quot;Oh say can
you see by the dawn's early light&quot;X and X&quot;Oh
sit!&quot;X. See Camel chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regular expression modifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A word with a specific,
built-in meaning to a <b>compiler</b>, such as
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;delete&quot;. In many languages (not
Perl), itXs illegal to use reserved words to name anything

<p style="margin-left:11%;">runtime</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The time when Perl is actually
doing what your code says to do, as opposed to the earlier

<p style="margin-left:11%;">runtime pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A pattern that contains one or
more variables to be interpolated before parsing the pattern
as a <b>regular expression</b>, and that therefore cannot be
analyzed at compile time, but must be reanalyzed each time
the pattern match operator is evaluated. Runtime patterns
are useful but expensive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">scope</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">From how far away you can see a
variable, looking through one. Perl has two visibility
mechanisms. It does <b>dynamic scoping</b> of
&quot;local&quot; <b>variables</b>, meaning that the rest of
the <b>block</b>, and any <b>subroutines</b> that are called
by the rest of the block, can see the variables that are
local to the block. Perl does <b>lexical scoping</b> of
&quot;my&quot; variables, meaning that the rest of the block
can see the variable, but other subroutines called by the
block <i>cannot</i> see the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">scratchpad</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The area in which a particular
invocation of a particular file or subroutine keeps some of
its temporary values, including any lexically scoped
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">script</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A text <b>file</b> that is a
program intended to be <b>executed</b> directly rather than
<b>compiled</b> to another form of file before
<b>execution</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also, in the
context of <b>Unicode</b>, a writing system for a particular
language or group of languages, such as Greek, Bengali, or
Tengwar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">script kiddie</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>cracker</b> who is not a
<b>hacker</b> but knows just enough to run canned scripts. A
<b>cargo-cult</b> programmer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">semaphore</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A fancy kind of interlock that
prevents multiple <b>threads</b> or <b>processes</b> from
using up the same resources simultaneously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">separator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>character</b> or
<b>string</b> that keeps two surrounding strings from being
confused with each other. The &quot;split&quot; function
works on separators. Not to be confused with
<b>delimiters</b> or <b>terminators</b>. The XorX in the
previous sentence separated the two alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">serialization</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Putting a fancy <b>data
structure</b> into linear order so that it can be stored as
a <b>string</b> in a disk file or database, or sent through
a <b>pipe</b>. Also called marshalling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">server</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In networking, a <b>process</b>
that either advertises a <b>service</b> or just hangs around
at a known location and waits for <b>clients</b> who need
service to get in touch with it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">service</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something you do for someone
else to make them happy, like giving them the time of day
(or of their life). On some machines, well-known services
are listed by the &quot;getservent&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">setgid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as <b>setuid</b>, only
having to do with giving away <b>group</b> privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">setuid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Said of a program that runs
with the privileges of its <b>owner</b> rather than (as is
usually the case) the privileges of whoever is running it.
Also describes the bit in the mode word (<b>permission
bits</b>) that controls the feature. This bit must be
explicitly set by the owner to enable this feature, and the
program must be carefully written not to give away more
privileges than it ought to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">shared memory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A piece of <b>memory</b>
accessible by two different <b>processes</b> who otherwise
would not see each otherXs memory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">shebang</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Irish for the whole
McGillicuddy. In Perl culture, a portmanteau of XsharpX and
XbangX, meaning the &quot;#!&quot; sequence that tells the
system where to find the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">shell</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>command</b>&minus;line
<b>interpreter</b>. The program that interactively gives you
a prompt, accepts one or more <b>lines</b> of input, and
executes the programs you mentioned, feeding each of them
their proper <b>arguments</b> and input data. Shells can
also execute scripts containing such commands. Under Unix,
typical shells include the Bourne shell (<i>/bin/sh</i>),
the C shell (<i>/bin/csh</i>), and the Korn shell
(<i>/bin/ksh</i>). Perl is not strictly a shell because itXs
not interactive (although Perl programs can be
interactive).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">side effects</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Something extra that happens
when you evaluate an <b>expression</b>. Nowadays it can
refer to almost anything. For example, evaluating a simple
assignment statement typically has the Xside effectX of
assigning a value to a variable. (And you thought assigning
the value was your primary intent in the first place!)
Likewise, assigning a value to the special variable $|
($AUTOFLUSH) has the side effect of forcing a flush after
every &quot;write&quot; or &quot;print&quot; on the
currently selected filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sigil</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A glyph used in magic. Or, for
Perl, the symbol in front of a variable name, such as
&quot;$&quot;, &quot;@&quot;, and &quot;%&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">signal</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A bolt out of the blue; that
is, an event triggered by the <b>operating system</b>,
probably when youXre least expecting it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">signal handler</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>subroutine</b> that,
instead of being content to be called in the normal fashion,
sits around waiting for a bolt out of the blue before it
will deign to <b>execute</b>. Under Perl, bolts out of the
blue are called signals, and you send them with the
&quot;kill&quot; built-in. See the %SIG hash in Camel
chapter 25, XSpecial NamesX and the section XSignalsX in
Camel chapter 15, XInterprocess CommunicationX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">single inheritance</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The features you got from your
mother, if she told you that you donXt have a father. (See
also <b>inheritance</b> and <b>multiple inheritance</b>.) In
computer languages, the idea that <b>classes</b> reproduce
asexually so that a given class can only have one direct
ancestor or <b>base class</b>. Perl supplies no such
restriction, though you may certainly program Perl that way
if you like.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">slice</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A selection of any number of
<b>elements</b> from a <b>list</b>, <b>array</b>, or
<b>hash</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">slurp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To read an entire <b>file</b>
into a <b>string</b> in one operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">socket</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An endpoint for network
communication among multiple <b>processes</b> that works
much like a telephone or a post office box. The most
important thing about a socket is its <b>network address</b>
(like a phone number). Different kinds of sockets have
different kinds of addressesXsome look like filenames, and
some donXt.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">soft reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See <b>symbolic
reference</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">source filter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special kind of <b>module</b>
that does <b>preprocessing</b> on your script just before it
gets to the <b>tokener</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A device you can put things on
the top of, and later take them back off in the opposite
order in which you put them on. See
<b><small>LIFO</small></b> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Included in the official Perl
distribution, as in a standard module, a standard tool, or a
standard Perl <b>manpage</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default output
<b>stream</b> for nasty remarks that donXt belong in
<b>standard output</b>. Represented within a Perl program by
the output&gt; <b>filehandle</b> &quot;STDERR&quot;. You can
use this stream explicitly, but the &quot;die&quot; and
&quot;warn&quot; built-ins write to your standard error
stream automatically (unless trapped or otherwise
intercepted).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard input</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default input <b>stream</b>
for your program, which if possible shouldnXt care where its
data is coming from. Represented within a Perl program by
the <b>filehandle</b> &quot;STDIN&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard I/O</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A standard C library for doing
<b>buffered</b> input and output to the <b>operating
system</b>. (The XstandardX of standard I/O is at most
marginally related to the XstandardX of standard input and
output.) In general, Perl relies on whatever implementation
of standard I/O a given operating system supplies, so the
buffering characteristics of a Perl program on one machine
may not exactly match those on another machine. Normally
this only influences efficiency, not semantics. If your
standard I/O package is doing block buffering and you want
it to <b>flush</b> the buffer more often, just set the $|
variable to a true value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Standard Library</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Everything that comes with the
official <i>perl</i> distribution. Some vendor versions of
<i>perl</i> change their distributions, leaving out some
parts or including extras. See also <b>dual-lived</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">standard output</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default output
<b>stream</b> for your program, which if possible shouldnXt
care where its data is going. Represented within a Perl
program by the <b>filehandle</b> &quot;STDOUT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>command</b> to the
computer about what to do next, like a step in a recipe:
XAdd marmalade to batter and mix until mixed.X A statement
is distinguished from a <b>declaration</b>, which doesnXt
tell the computer to do anything, but just to learn
something.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">statement modifier</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>conditional</b> or
<b>loop</b> that you put after the <b>statement</b> instead
of before, if you know what we mean.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">static</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Varying slowly compared to
something else. (Unfortunately, everything is relatively
stable compared to something else, except for certain
elementary particles, and weXre not so sure about them.) In
computers, where things are supposed to vary rapidly,
XstaticX has a derogatory connotation, indicating a slightly
dysfunctional <b>variable</b>, <b>subroutine</b>, or
<b>method</b>. In Perl culture, the word is politely
avoided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If youXre a C
or C <small>++</small> programmer, you might be looking for
PerlXs &quot;state&quot; keyword.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">static method</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">No such thing. See <b>class
method</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">No such thing. See <b>lexical
scoping</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">static variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">No such thing. Just use a
<b>lexical variable</b> in a scope larger than your
<b>subroutine</b>, or declare it with &quot;state&quot;
instead of with &quot;my&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stat structure</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A special internal spot in
which Perl keeps the information about the last <b>file</b>
on which you requested information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">status</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The <b>value</b> returned to
the parent <b>process</b> when one of its child processes
dies. This value is placed in the special variable $?. Its
upper eight <b>bits</b> are the exit status of the defunct
process, and its lower eight bits identify the signal (if
any) that the process died from. On Unix systems, this
status value is the same as the status word returned by
<i>wait</i>(2). See &quot;system&quot; in Camel chapter 27,
XFunctionsX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stream</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A flow of data into or out of a
process as a steady sequence of bytes or characters, without
the appearance of being broken up into packets. This is a
kind of <b>interface</b>Xthe underlying
<b>implementation</b> may well break your data up into
separate packets for delivery, but this is hidden from
you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A sequence of characters such
as XHe said !@#*&amp;%@#*?!X. A string does not have to be
entirely printable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">string context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The situation in which an
expression is expected by its surroundings (the code calling
it) to return a <b>string</b>. See also <b>context</b> and
<b>numeric context</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">stringification</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A named or otherwise accessible
piece of program that can be invoked from elsewhere in the
program in order to accomplish some subgoal of the program.
A subroutine is often parameterized to accomplish different
but related things depending on its input <b>arguments</b>.
If the subroutine returns a meaningful <b>value</b>, it is
also called a <b>function</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">subscript</p>

the position of a particular <b>array element</b> in an
array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">substitution</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">superuser</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The person whom the

<p style="margin-left:11%;">switch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An option you give on a command
line to influence the way your program works, usually
introduced with a minus sign. The word is also used as a
nickname for a <b>switch statement</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">switch cluster</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The combination of multiple
command&minus; line switches (<i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Xa Xb
Xc&quot;) into one switch (<i>e.g.</i>, &quot;Xabc&quot;).
Any switch with an additional <b>argument</b> must be the
last switch in a cluster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">switch statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A program technique that lets
you evaluate an <b>expression</b> and then, based on the
value of the expression, do a multiway branch to the
appropriate piece of code for that value. Also called a
Xcase structureX, named after the similar Pascal construct.
Most switch statements in Perl are spelled
&quot;given&quot;. See XThe &quot;given&quot; statementX in
Camel chapter 4, XStatements and DeclarationsX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbol</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Generally, any <b>token</b> or
<b>metasymbol</b>. Often used more specifically to mean the
sort of name you might find in a <b>symbol table</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbolic debugger</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A program that lets you step
through the <b>execution</b> of your program, stopping or
printing things out here and there to see whether anything
has gone wrong, and, if so, what. The XsymbolicX part just
means that you can talk to the debugger using the same
symbols with which your program is written.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbolic link</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An alternate filename that
points to the real <b>filename</b>, which in turn points to
the real <b>file</b>. Whenever the <b>operating system</b>
is trying to parse a <b>pathname</b> containing a symbolic
link, it merely substitutes the new name and continues
parsing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbolic reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A variable whose value is the
name of another variable or subroutine. By
<b>dereferencing</b> the first variable, you can get at the
second one. Symbolic references are illegal under &quot;use
strict &quot;refs&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">symbol table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Where a <b>compiler</b>
remembers symbols. A program like Perl must somehow remember
all the names of all the <b>variables</b>,
<b>filehandles</b>, and <b>subroutines</b> youXve used. It
does this by placing the names in a symbol table, which is
implemented in Perl using a <b>hash table</b>. There is a
separate symbol table for each <b>package</b> to give each
package its own <b>namespace</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">synchronous</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Programming in which the
orderly sequence of events can be determined; that is, when
things happen one after the other, not at the same time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An internal representation of
your program wherein lower-level <b>constructs</b> dangle
off the higher-level constructs enclosing them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syscall</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>function</b> call directly
to the <b>operating system</b>. Many of the important
subroutines and functions you use arenXt direct system
calls, but are built up in one or more layers above the
system call level. In general, Perl programmers donXt need
to worry about the distinction. However, if you do happen to
know which Perl functions are really syscalls, you can
predict which of these will set the $! ($ERRNO) variable on
failure. Unfortunately, beginning programmers often
confusingly employ the term Xsystem callX to mean what
happens when you call the Perl &quot;system&quot; function,
which actually involves many syscalls. To avoid any
confusion, we nearly always say XsyscallX for something you
could call indirectly via PerlXs &quot;syscall&quot;
function, and never for something you would call with PerlXs
&quot;system&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>T</b> <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">tainted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Said of data derived from the
grubby hands of a user, and thus unsafe for a secure program
to rely on. Perl does taint checks if you run a
<b>setuid</b> (or <b>setgid</b>) program, or if you use the
&quot;XT&quot; switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">taint mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Running under the

<p style="margin-left:11%;">terminator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>character</b> or
<b>string</b> that marks the end of another string. The $/
variable contains the string that terminates a
&quot;readline&quot; operation, which &quot;chomp&quot;
deletes from the end. Not to be confused with
<b>delimiters</b> or <b>separators</b>. The period at the
end of this sentence is a terminator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">thread</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like a forked process, but
without <b>fork</b>Xs inherent memory protection. A thread
is lighter weight than a full process, in that a process
could have multiple threads running around in it, all
fighting over the same processXs memory space unless steps

English doesnXt use Unicode titlecase, but casing rules for
English titles are more complicated than simply capitalizing
each wordXs first character.</p>

into <b>tokens</b>. Also known as XlexingX, in which case
you get XlexemesX instead of tokens.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">toolbox approach</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The notion that, with a
complete set of simple tools that work well together, you
can build almost anything you want. Which is fine if youXre
assembling a tricycle, but if youXre building a
defranishizing comboflux regurgalator, you really want your

representation into another by mapping each character of the
source string to its corresponding character in the result
string. Not to be confused with translation: for example,
Greek <i><small>XXXXXXXXXX</small></i> transliterates into
<i>polychromos</i> but translates into <i>many-colored</i>.
See the &quot;tr///&quot; operator in Camel chapter 5,
XPattern MatchingX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">trigger</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An event that causes a

evaluate to 0 or &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">truncating</p>

<b>class</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">type casting</p>

it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">typedef</p>

C <small>++</small> languages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">typed lexical</p>

&quot;my Pony $bill&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">typeglob</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">umask</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A mask of those <b>permission
bits</b> that should be forced off when creating files or

<p style="margin-left:11%;">unary operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An operator with only one
<b>operand</b>, like &quot;!&quot; or &quot;chdir&quot;.
Unary operators are usually prefix operators; that is, they
precede their operand. The &quot;++&quot; and &quot;XX&quot;

<i>does</i> change their meanings.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unicode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A character set comprising all
the major character sets of the world, more or less. See
&lt;http://www.unicode.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A very large and constantly
evolving language with several alternative and largely
incompatible syntaxes, in which anyone can define anything
any way they choose, and usually do. Speakers of this
language think itXs easy to learn because itXs so easily
twisted to oneXs own ends, but dialectical differences make
tribal intercommunication nearly impossible, and travelers
are often reduced to a pidgin-like subset of the language.
To be universally understood, a Unix shell programmer must
spend years of study in the art. Many have abandoned this
discipline and now communicate via an Esperanto-like
language called Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In ancient
times, Unix was also used to refer to some code that a
couple of people at Bell Labs wrote to make use of a
<small>PDP&minus;7</small> computer that wasnXt doing much
of anything else at the time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">uppercase</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In Unicode, not just characters

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>V</b> <br>
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An actual piece of data, in
contrast to all the variables, references, keys, indices,
operators, and whatnot that you need to access the
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A named storage location that
can hold any of various kinds of <b>value</b>, as your
program sees fit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">variable interpolation</p>

scalar or array variable into a string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">variadic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Said of a <b>function</b> that
happily receives an indeterminate number of <b>actual
arguments</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">vector</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mathematical jargon for a list
of <b>scalar values</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">virtual</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Providing the appearance of
something without the reality, as in: virtual memory is not
real memory. (See also <b>memory</b>.) The opposite of
XvirtualX is XtransparentX, which means providing the
reality of something without the appearance, as in: Perl
handles the variable-length <small>UTFX8</small> character
encoding transparently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">void context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A form of <b>scalar context</b>
in which an <b>expression</b> is not expected to return any
<b>value</b> at all and is evaluated for its <b>side
effects</b> alone.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">v&minus;string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A XversionX or XvectorX
<b>string</b> specified with a &quot;v&quot; followed by a
series of decimal integers in dot notation, for instance,
&quot;v1.20.300.4000&quot;. Each number turns into a
<b>character</b> with the specified ordinal value. (The
&quot;v&quot; is optional when there are at least three
integers.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>W</b> <br>
warning</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A message printed to the
&quot;STDERR&quot; stream to the effect that something might
be wrong but isnXt worth blowing up over. See
&quot;warn&quot; in Camel chapter 27, XFunctionsX and the
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma in Camel chapter 28, XPragmantic
ModulesX.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">watch expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An expression which, when its
value changes, causes a breakpoint in the Perl debugger.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">weak reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A reference that doesnXt get
counted normally. When all the normal references to data
disappear, the data disappears. These are useful for
circular references that would never disappear
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">whitespace</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <b>character</b> that moves
your cursor but doesnXt otherwise put anything on your
screen. Typically refers to any of: space, tab, line feed,
carriage return, or form feed. In Unicode, matches many
other characters that Unicode considers whitespace,
including the X&minus;XX .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">word</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In normal XcomputereseX, the
piece of data of the size most efficiently handled by your
computer, typically 32 bits or so, give or take a few powers
of 2. In Perl culture, it more often refers to an
alphanumeric <b>identifier</b> (including underscores), or
to a string of nonwhitespace <b>characters</b> bounded by
whitespace or string boundaries.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">working directory</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Your current <b>directory</b>,
from which relative pathnames are interpreted by the
<b>operating system</b>. The operating system knows your
current directory because you told it with a
&quot;chdir&quot;, or because you started out in the place
where your parent <b>process</b> was when you were born.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">wrapper</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A program or subroutine that
runs some other program or subroutine for you, modifying
some of its input or output to better suit your
purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>WYSIWYG</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">What You See Is What You Get.
Usually used when something that appears on the screen
matches how it will eventually look, like PerlXs
&quot;format&quot; declarations. Also used to mean the
opposite of magic because everything works exactly as it
appears, as in the three&minus; argument form of
&quot;open&quot;.</p>

notification of its demise by virtue of having called
&quot;wait&quot; or &quot;waitpid&quot;. If you
&quot;fork&quot;, you must clean up after your child
processes when they exit; otherwise, the process table will
fill up and your system administrator will Not Be Happy with
you.</p>
