<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perldiag
&minus; various Perl diagnostics</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These messages
are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(W) A warning
(optional). <br>
(D) A deprecation (enabled by default). <br>
(S) A severe warning (enabled by default). <br>
(F) A fatal error (trappable). <br>
(P) An internal error you should never see (trappable). <br>
(X) A very fatal error (nontrappable). <br>
(A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The majority of
messages from the first three classifications above (W, D
&amp; S) can be controlled using the &quot;warnings&quot;
pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a message
can be controlled by the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma, its
warning category is included with the classification letter
in the description below. E.g. &quot;(W closed)&quot; means
a warning in the &quot;closed&quot; category.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Optional
warnings are enabled by using the &quot;warnings&quot;
pragma or the <b>&minus;w</b> and <b>&minus;W</b> switches.
Warnings may be captured by setting $SIG{__WARN__} to a
reference to a routine that will be called on each warning
instead of printing it. See perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Severe warnings
are always enabled, unless they are explicitly disabled with
the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma or the <b>&minus;X</b>
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Trappable
errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See
&quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc. In almost all cases, warnings
may be selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors
using the &quot;warnings&quot; pragma. See warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The messages
are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
lower-case. Some of these messages are generic. Spots that
vary are denoted with a %s or other printf-style escape.
These escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order, as are
all characters other than letters. To look up your message,
just ignore anything that is not a letter. <b><br>
accept()</b> on closed socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to do an
accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the
return value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See
&quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Aliasing via reference is
experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::refaliasing)
This warning is emitted if you use a reference constructor
on the left-hand side of an assignment to alias one variable
to another. Simply suppress the warning if you want to use
the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the
risk of using an experimental feature which may change or be
removed in a future Perl version:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">no warnings
&quot;experimental::refaliasing&quot;; <br>
use feature &quot;refaliasing&quot;; <br>
\$x = \$y;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;%c&rsquo; allowed only
after types %s in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The modifiers
&rsquo;!&rsquo;, &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;
are allowed in <b>pack()</b> or <b>unpack()</b> only after
certain types. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">alpha&minus;&gt;<b>numify()</b>
is lossy</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W numeric) An alpha version
can not be numified without losing information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous call resolved as
CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) A subroutine you
have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you
have used the name without qualification for calling one or
the other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To force
interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its
package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or
pretend that it&rsquo;s imported with the &quot;use
subs&quot; pragma).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To silently
interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
&quot;CORE::&quot; prefix on the operator (e.g.
&quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;) or declare the subroutine to be
an object method (see &quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot; in
perlsub or attributes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous range in
transliteration operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You wrote something like
&quot;tr/a&minus;z&minus;0//&quot; which doesn&rsquo;t mean
anything at all. To include a &quot;&minus;&quot; character
in a transliteration, put it either first or last. (In the
past, &quot;tr/a&minus;z&minus;0//&quot; was synonymous with
&quot;tr/a&minus;y//&quot;, which was probably not what you
would have expected.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of %s resolved as
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S ambiguous) You said
something that may not be interpreted the way you thought.
Normally it&rsquo;s pretty easy to disambiguate it by
supplying a missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of &minus;%s
resolved as &minus;&amp;%s()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S ambiguous) You wrote
something like &quot;&minus;foo&quot;, which might be the
string &quot;&minus;foo&quot;, or a call to the function
&quot;foo&quot;, negated. If you meant the string, just
write &quot;&minus;foo&quot;. If you meant the function
call, write &quot;&minus;foo()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of %c resolved as
operator %c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S ambiguous) &quot;%&quot;,
&quot;&amp;&quot;, and &quot;*&quot; are both infix
operators (modulus, bitwise and, and multiplication)
<i>and</i> initial special characters (denoting hashes,
subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something like
&quot;*foo * foo&quot; that might be interpreted as either
of them. We assumed you meant the infix operator, but please
try to make it more clear -- in the example given, you might
write &quot;*foo * foo()&quot; if you really meant to
multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of %c{%s}
resolved to %c%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) You wrote
something like &quot;@{foo}&quot;, which might be asking for
the variable @foo, or it might be calling a function named
foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference. If you
wanted the variable, you can just write @foo. If you wanted
to call the function, write &quot;@{foo()}&quot; ... or you
could just not have a variable and a function with the same
name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]}
resolved to %c%s[...] <br>
Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) You wrote
something like &quot;${foo[2]}&quot; (where foo represents
the name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for
element number 2 of the array named @foo, in which case
please write $foo[2], or you might have meant to pass an
anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and then do a
scalar deref on the value it returns. If you meant that,
write &quot;${foo([2])}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In regular
expressions, the &quot;${foo[2]}&quot; syntax is sometimes
necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts and
character classes. &quot;/$length[2345]/&quot;, for
instance, will be interpreted as $length followed by the
character class &quot;[2345]&quot;. If an array subscript is
what you want, you can avoid the warning by changing
&quot;/${length[2345]}/&quot; to the unsightly
&quot;/${\$length[2345]}/&quot;, by renaming your array to
something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword, or
by simply turning off warnings with &quot;no warnings
'ambiguous';&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;|&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; may not both be specified on command
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl does its own command line
redirection, and found that <small>STDIN</small> was a pipe,
and that you also tried to redirect <small>STDIN</small>
using &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo;. Only one <small>STDIN</small>
stream to a customer, please.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;|&rsquo; and
&rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; may not both be specified on command
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl does its own command line
redirection, and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to
a file and into a pipe to another command. You need to
choose one or the other, though nothing&rsquo;s stopping you
from piping into a program or Perl script which
&rsquo;splits&rsquo; output into two streams, such as</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;)
or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;; <br>
while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { <br>
print; <br>
print OUT; <br>
} <br>
close OUT;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Applying %s to %s will act on
scalar(%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) The pattern match
(&quot;//&quot;), substitution (&quot;s///&quot;), and
transliteration (&quot;tr///&quot;) operators work on scalar
values. If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it
will convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length
of an array, or the population info of a hash) and then work
on that scalar value. This is probably not what you meant to
do. See &quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;map&quot; in
perlfunc for alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Arg too short for msgsnd</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) <b>msgsnd()</b> requires a
string at least as long as sizeof(long).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Argument &quot;%s&quot;
isn&rsquo;t numeric%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W numeric) The indicated
string was fed as an argument to an operator that expected a
numeric value instead. If you&rsquo;re fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that for
the &quot;Inf&quot; and &quot;NaN&quot; (infinity and
not-a-number) the definition of &quot;numeric&quot; is
somewhat unusual: the strings themselves (like
&quot;Inf&quot;) are considered numeric, and anything
following them is considered non-numeric.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Argument list not closed for
PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W layer) When pushing a layer
with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you forgot the )
that closes the argument list. (Layers take care of
transforming data between external and internal
representations.) Perl stopped parsing the layer list at
this point and did not attempt to push this layer. If your
program didn&rsquo;t explicitly request the failing
operation, it may be the result of the value of the
environment variable <small>PERLIO.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Argument &quot;%s&quot; treated
as 0 in increment (++)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W numeric) The indicated
string was fed as an argument to the &quot;++&quot; operator
which expects either a number or a string matching
&quot;/^[a&minus;zA&minus;Z]*[0&minus;9]*\z/&quot;. See
&quot;Auto-increment and Auto-decrement&quot; in perlop for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Array passed to stat will be
coerced to a scalar%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You called
<b>stat()</b> on an array, but the array will be coerced to
a scalar &minus; the number of elements in the array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">A signature parameter must
start with &rsquo;$&rsquo;, &rsquo;@&rsquo; or
&rsquo;%&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Each subroutine signature
parameter declaration must start with a valid sigil; for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub foo ($a, $,
$b = 1, @c) {}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">A slurpy parameter may not have
a default value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only scalar subroutine
signature parameters may have a default value; for
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub foo ($a =
1) {} # legal <br>
sub foo (@a = (1)) {} # invalid <br>
sub foo (%a = (a =&gt; b)) {} # invalid</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">assertion botched: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The malloc package that
comes with Perl had an internal failure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Assertion %s failed: file
&quot;%s&quot;, line %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) A general assertion failed.
The file in question must be examined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Assigned value is not a
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign
something that was not a reference to an lvalue reference
(e.g., &quot;\$x = $y&quot;). If you meant to make $x an
alias to $y, use &quot;\$x = \$y&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Assigned value is not %s
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign a
reference to a reference constructor, but the two references
were not of the same type. You cannot alias a scalar to an
array, or an array to a hash; the two types must match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">\$x = \@y; #
error <br>
\@x = \%y; # error <br>
$y = []; <br>
\$x = $y; # error; did you mean \$y?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Assigning non-zero to $[ is no
longer possible</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When the
&quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled (e.g., and under
&quot;use v5.16;&quot;, and as of Perl 5.30) the special
variable $[, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero
value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Assignment to both a list and a
scalar</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) If you assign to a
conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments must either
both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise Perl won&rsquo;t
know which context to supply to the right side.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Assuming <small>NOT</small> a
<small>POSIX</small> class since %s in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in <br>
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You had something
like these:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[[:alnum]] <br>
[[:digit:xyz]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">They look like
they might have been meant to be the <small>POSIX</small>
classes &quot;[:alnum:]&quot; or &quot;[:digit:]&quot;. If
so, they should be written:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[[:alnum:]]
<br>
[[:digit:]xyz]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Since these
aren&rsquo;t legal <small>POSIX</small> class
specifications, but are legal bracketed character classes,
Perl treats them as the latter. In the first example, it
matches the characters &quot;:&quot;, &quot;[&quot;,
&quot;a&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;,
and &quot;u&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If these
weren&rsquo;t meant to be <small>POSIX</small> classes, this
warning message is spurious, and can be suppressed by
reordering things, such as</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[[al:num]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[[:munla]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;&gt; at require-statement
should be quotes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You wrote &quot;require
&lt;file&gt;&quot; when you should have written
&quot;require 'file'&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to access disallowed
key &rsquo;%s&rsquo; in a restricted hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The failing code has
attempted to get or set a key which is not in the current
set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to bless into a freed
package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You wrote &quot;bless
$foo&quot; with one argument after somehow causing the
current package to be freed. Perl cannot figure out what to
do, so it throws up its hands in despair.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to bless into a
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The
<small>CLASSNAME</small> argument to the <b>bless()</b>
operator is expected to be the name of the package to bless
the resulting object into. You&rsquo;ve supplied instead a
reference to something: perhaps you wrote</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">bless $self,
$proto;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">when you
intended</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">bless $self,
ref($proto) || $proto;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you actually
want to bless into the stringified version of the reference
supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for example
by:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">bless $self,
&quot;$proto&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to clear deleted
array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S debugging) An array was
assigned to when it was being freed. Freed values are not
supposed to be visible to Perl code. This can also happen if
<small>XS</small> code calls &quot;av_clear&quot; from a
custom magic callback on the array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to delete disallowed
key &rsquo;%s&rsquo; from a restricted hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The failing code attempted
to delete from a restricted hash a key which is not in its
key set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to delete readonly key
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; from a restricted hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The failing code attempted
to delete a key whose value has been declared readonly from
a restricted hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free non-arena
<small>SV:</small> 0x%x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) All
<small>SV</small> objects are supposed to be allocated from
arenas that will be garbage collected on exit. An
<small>SV</small> was discovered to be outside any of those
arenas.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free nonexistent
shared string &rsquo;%s&rsquo;%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) Perl maintains a
reference-counted internal table of strings to optimize the
storage and access of hash keys and other strings. This
indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of
a string that can no longer be found in the table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free temp
prematurely: <small>SV</small> 0x%x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S debugging) Mortalized values
are supposed to be freed by the <b>free_tmps()</b> routine.
This indicates that something else is freeing the
<small>SV</small> before the <b>free_tmps()</b> routine gets
a chance, which means that the <b>free_tmps()</b> routine
will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to
free it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free unreferenced
glob pointers</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) The reference
counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to free unreferenced
scalar: <small>SV</small> 0x%x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) Perl went to
decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it would
go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0
earlier, and should have been freed, and in fact, probably
was freed. This could indicate that <b>SvREFCNT_dec()</b>
was called too many times, or that <b>SvREFCNT_inc()</b> was
called too few times, or that the <small>SV</small> was
mortalized when it shouldn&rsquo;t have been, or that memory
has been corrupted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to pack pointer to
temporary value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pack) You tried to pass a
temporary value (like the result of a function, or a
computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot; <b>pack()</b>
template. This means the result contains a pointer to a
location that could become invalid anytime, even before the
end of the current statement. Use literals or global values
as arguments to the &quot;p&quot; <b>pack()</b> template to
avoid this warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to reload %s
aborted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to load a file
with &quot;use&quot; or &quot;require&quot; that failed to
compile once already. Perl will not try to compile this file
again unless you delete its entry from %INC. See
&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;%INC&quot; in
perlvar.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to set length of freed
array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You tried to set the
length of an array which has been freed. You can do this by
storing a reference to the scalar representing the last
index of an array and later assigning through that
reference. For example</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$r = do {my @a;
\$#a}; <br>
$$r = 503</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attempt to use reference as
lvalue in substr</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W substr) You supplied a
reference as the first argument to <b>substr()</b> used as
an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps you forgot to
dereference it first. See &quot;substr&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Attribute prototype(%s)
discards earlier prototype attribute in same <br>
sub</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) A sub was declared as
sub foo : prototype(A) : prototype(B) {}, for example. Since
each sub can only have one prototype, the earlier
declaration(s) are discarded while the last one is
applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">av_reify called on tied
array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S debugging) This indicates
that something went wrong and Perl got <i>very</i> confused
about @_ or @DB::args being tied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad arg length for %s, is %u,
should be %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You passed a buffer of the
wrong size to one of <b>msgctl()</b>, <b>semctl()</b> or
<b>shmctl()</b>. In C parlance, the correct sizes are,
respectively, sizeof(struct&nbsp;msqid_ds&nbsp;*),
sizeof(struct&nbsp;semid_ds&nbsp;*), and
sizeof(struct&nbsp;shmid_ds&nbsp;*).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad evalled substitution
pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve used the
&quot;/e&quot; switch to evaluate the replacement for a
substitution, but perl found a syntax error in the code to
evaluate, most likely an unexpected right brace
&rsquo;}&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad filehandle: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A symbol was passed to
something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol has no
filehandle associated with it. Perhaps you didn&rsquo;t do
an <b>open()</b>, or did it in another package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad <b>free()</b> ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S malloc) An internal routine
called <b>free()</b> on something that had never been
<b>malloc()</b>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be
disabled by setting environment variable
&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; to 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This message
can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems with
&quot;hard&quot; dynamic linking, like &quot;AIX&quot; and
&quot;OS/2&quot;. It is a bug of &quot;Berkeley DB&quot;
which is left unnoticed if &quot;DB&quot; uses
<i>forgiving</i> system <b>malloc()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Badly placed ()&rsquo;s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check
the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad name after %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You started to name a
symbol by using a package prefix, and then didn&rsquo;t
finish the symbol. In particular, you can&rsquo;t
interpolate outside of quotes, so</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$var = 'myvar';
<br>
$sym = mypack::$var;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">is not the same

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$var = 'myvar';
<br>
$sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad plugin affecting keyword
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An extension using the
keyword plugin mechanism violated the plugin
<small>API.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad <b>realloc()</b>
ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S malloc) An internal routine
called <b>realloc()</b> on something that had never been
<b>malloc()</b>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be
disabled by setting the environment variable
&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot; to 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad symbol for array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal request asked
to add an array entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a
symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad symbol for dirhandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal request asked
to add a dirhandle entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a
symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad symbol for filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal request asked
to add a filehandle entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a
symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad symbol for hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal request asked
to add a hash entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a symbol
table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad symbol for scalar</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal request asked
to add a scalar entry to something that wasn&rsquo;t a
symbol table entry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword found in
conditional</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W bareword) The compiler found
a bareword where it expected a conditional, which often
indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the
last argument of the previous construct, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">open FOO ||
die;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It may also
indicate a misspelled constant that has been interpreted as
a bareword:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use constant
TYPO =&gt; 1; <br>
if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;strict&quot; pragma is useful in avoiding such
errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword in require contains
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
Bareword in require maps to disallowed filename
&quot;%s&quot; <br>
Bareword in require maps to empty filename</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The bareword form of
require has been invoked with a filename which could not
have been generated by a valid bareword permitted by the
parser. You shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get this error from
Perl code, but <small>XS</small> code may throw it if it
passes an invalid module name to
&quot;Perl_load_module&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword in require must not
start with a double-colon: &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) In &quot;require
Bare::Word&quot;, the bareword is not allowed to start with
a double-colon. Write &quot;require ::Foo::Bar&quot; as
&quot;require Foo::Bar&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not
allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) With &quot;strict
subs&quot; in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of
the &quot;=&gt;&quot; symbol. Perhaps you need to predeclare
a subroutine?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers
to nonexistent package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W bareword) You used a
qualified bareword of the form &quot;Foo::&quot;, but the
compiler saw no other uses of that namespace before that
point. Perhaps you need to predeclare a package?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword filehandle
&quot;%s&quot; not allowed under &rsquo;no feature <br>
&quot;bareword_filehandles&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You attempted to use a
bareword filehandle with the
&quot;bareword_filehandles&quot; feature disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Only the
built-in handles &quot;STDIN&quot;, &quot;STDOUT&quot;,
&quot;STDERR&quot;, &quot;ARGV&quot;, &quot;ARGVOUT&quot;
and &quot;DATA&quot; can be used with the
&quot;bareword_filehandles&quot; feature disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BEGIN</small>
failed--compilation aborted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An untrapped exception was
raised while executing a <small>BEGIN</small> subroutine.
Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is
exited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>BEGIN</small> not safe
after errors--compilation aborted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl found a &quot;BEGIN
{}&quot; subroutine (or a &quot;use&quot; directive, which
implies a &quot;BEGIN {}&quot;) after one or more
compilation errors had already occurred. Since the intended
environment for the &quot;BEGIN {}&quot; could not be
guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code
likely depends on its correct operation, Perl just gave
up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">\%d better written as $%d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) Outside of patterns,
backreferences live on as variables. The use of backslashes
is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a substitution,
but stylistically it&rsquo;s better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works
better if there are more than 9 backreferences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Binary number &gt;
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) The binary number
you specified is larger than 2**32&minus;1 (4294967295) and
therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bind()</b> on closed socket
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to do a
bind on a closed socket. Did you forget to check the return
value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See &quot;bind&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>binmode()</b> on closed
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried
<b>binmode()</b> on a filehandle that was never opened.
Check your control flow and number of arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bit vector size &gt; 32
non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) Using bit vector
sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bizarre copy of %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Perl detected an attempt to
copy an internal value that is not copiable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bizarre SvTYPE [%d]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) When starting a new thread
or returning values from a thread, Perl encountered an
invalid data type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Both or neither range ends
should be Unicode in regex; marked by <br>
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) (only under
&quot;use&nbsp;re&nbsp;'strict'&quot; or within
&quot;(?[...])&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In a bracketed
character class in a regular expression pattern, you had a
range which has exactly one end of it specified using
&quot;\N{}&quot;, and the other end is specified using a
non-portable mechanism. Perl treats the range as a Unicode
range, that is, all the characters in it are considered to
be the Unicode characters, and which may be different code
points on some platforms Perl runs on. For example,
&quot;[\N{U+06}&minus;\x08]&quot; is treated as if you had
instead said &quot;[\N{U+06}&minus;\N{U+08}]&quot;, that is
it matches the characters whose code points in Unicode are
6, 7, and 8. But that &quot;\x08&quot; might indicate that
you meant something different, so the warning gets
raised.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Buffer overflow in
prime_env_iter: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) A warning peculiar
to <small>VMS.</small> While Perl was preparing to iterate
over %ENV, it encountered a logical name or symbol
definition which was too long, so it was truncated to the
string shown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Built-in function
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::builtin) A
call is being made to a function in the
&quot;builtin::&quot; namespace, which is currently
experimental. The existence or nature of the function may be
subject to change in a future version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">builtin::import can only be
called at compile time</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;import&quot;
method of the &quot;builtin&quot; package was invoked when
no code is currently being compiled. Since this method is
used to introduce new lexical subroutines into the scope
currently being compiled, this is not going to have any
effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Callback called exit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A subroutine invoked from
an external package via <b>call_sv()</b> exited by calling
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s() called too early to check
prototype</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W prototype) You&rsquo;ve
called a function that has a prototype before the parser saw
a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
that the call conforms to the prototype. You need to either
add an early prototype declaration for the subroutine in
question, or move the subroutine definition ahead of the
call to get proper prototype checking. Alternatively, if you
are certain that you&rsquo;re calling the function
correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid
the warning. See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot chr %f</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You passed an invalid
number (like an infinity or not-a-number) to
&quot;chr&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot complete in-place edit
of %s: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your perl script appears to
have changed directory while performing an in-place edit of
a file specified by a relative path, and your system
doesn&rsquo;t include the directory relative
<small>POSIX</small> functions needed to handle that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot compress %f in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried compressing an
infinity or not-a-number as an unsigned integer with
<small>BER,</small> which makes no sense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot compress integer in
pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An argument to
pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was too large to compress. The
<small>BER</small> compressed integer format can only be
used with positive integers, and you attempted to compress a
very large number (&gt; 1e308). See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot compress negative
numbers in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An argument to
pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was negative. The <small>BER</small>
compressed integer format can only be used with positive
integers. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot convert a reference to
%s to typeglob</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You manipulated
Perl&rsquo;s symbol table directly, stored a reference in
it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl
syntax. The access triggers Perl to autovivify that
typeglob, but it there is no legal conversion from that type
of reference to a typeglob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot copy to %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Perl detected an attempt to
copy a value to an internal type that cannot be directly
assigned to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot find encoding
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S io) You tried to apply an
encoding that did not exist to a filehandle, either with
<b>open()</b> or <b>binmode()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot open %s as a dirhandle:
it is already open as a filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use
<b>opendir()</b> to associate a dirhandle to a symbol (glob
or scalar) that already holds a filehandle. Since this idiom
might render your code confusing, it was deprecated in Perl
5.10. As of Perl 5.28, it is a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot open %s as a filehandle:
it is already open as a dirhandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use
<b>open()</b> to associate a filehandle to a symbol (glob or
scalar) that already holds a dirhandle. Since this idiom
might render your code confusing, it was deprecated in Perl
5.10. As of Perl 5.28, it is a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot pack %f with
&rsquo;%c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried converting an
infinity or not-a-number to an integer, which makes no
sense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot printf %f with
&rsquo;%c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried printing an
infinity or not-a-number as a character (%c), which makes no
sense. Maybe you meant &rsquo;%s&rsquo;, or just
stringifying it?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot set tied @DB::args</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) &quot;caller&quot; tried to
set @DB::args, but found it tied. Tying @DB::args is not
supported. (Before this error was added, it used to
crash.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot tie unreifiable
array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) You somehow managed to call
&quot;tie&quot; on an array that does not keep a reference
count on its arguments and cannot be made to do so. Such
arrays are not even supposed to be accessible to Perl code,
but are only used internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot yet reorder
<b>sv_vcatpvfn()</b> arguments from va_list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Some <small>XS</small> code
tried to use &quot;sv_vcatpvfn()&quot; or a related function
with a format string that specifies explicit indexes for
some of the elements, and using a C&minus;style
variable-argument list (a &quot;va_list&quot;). This is not
currently supported. <small>XS</small> authors wanting to do
this must instead construct a C array of &quot;SV*&quot;
scalars containing the arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can only compress unsigned
integers in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An argument to
pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was not an integer. The
<small>BER</small> compressed integer format can only be
used with positive integers, and you attempted to compress
something else. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;%s&quot; out
of a &quot;defer&quot; block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An attempt was made to jump
out of the scope of a &quot;defer&quot; block by using a
control-flow statement such as &quot;return&quot;,
&quot;goto&quot; or a loop control. This is not
permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;%s&quot; out
of a &quot;finally&quot; block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Similar to above, but
involving a &quot;finally&quot; block at the end of a
&quot;try&quot;/&quot;catch&quot; construction rather than a
&quot;defer&quot; block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t bless non-reference
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only hard references may be
blessed. This is how Perl &quot;enforces&quot; encapsulation
of objects. See perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;break&quot;
in a loop topicalizer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called
&quot;break&quot;, but you&rsquo;re in a &quot;foreach&quot;
block rather than a &quot;given&quot; block. You probably
meant to use &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;break&quot;
outside a given block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called
&quot;break&quot;, but you&rsquo;re not inside a
&quot;given&quot; block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the syntax of a
method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or
package name contains an undefined value. Something like
this will reproduce the error:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$BADREF =
undef; <br>
process $BADREF 1,2,3; <br>
$BADREF&minus;&gt;process(1,2,3);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; on unblessed reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A method call must know in
what package it&rsquo;s supposed to run. It ordinarily finds
this out from the object reference you supply, but you
didn&rsquo;t supply an object reference in this case. A
reference isn&rsquo;t an object reference until it has been
blessed. See perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; without a package or object reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the syntax of a
method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or
package name contains an expression that returns a defined
value which is neither an object reference nor a package
name. Something like this will reproduce the error:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$BADREF = 42;
<br>
process $BADREF 1,2,3; <br>
$BADREF&minus;&gt;process(1,2,3);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t call
<b>mro_isa_changed_in()</b> on anonymous symbol table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Perl got confused as to
whether a hash was a plain hash or a symbol table hash when
trying to update @ISA caches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t call
<b>mro_method_changed_in()</b> on anonymous symbol table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An <small>XS</small> module
tried to call &quot;mro_method_changed_in&quot; on a hash
that was not attached to the symbol table.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t chdir to %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called &quot;perl
&minus;x/foo/bar&quot;, but <i>/foo/bar</i> is not a
directory that you can chdir to, possibly because it
doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t coerce %s to %s in
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Certain types of SVs, in
particular real symbol table entries (typeglobs),
can&rsquo;t be forced to stop being what they are. So you
can&rsquo;t say things like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">*foo += 1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You
<small>CAN</small> say</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$foo = *foo;
<br>
$foo += 1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">but then $foo
no longer contains a glob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t
&quot;continue&quot; outside a when block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called
&quot;continue&quot;, but you&rsquo;re not inside a
&quot;when&quot; or &quot;default&quot; block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t create pipe
mailbox</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> The process is suffering from exhausted
quotas or other plumbing problems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t declare %s in
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only scalar, array, and
hash variables may be declared as &quot;my&quot;,
&quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variables. They must
have ordinary identifiers as names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;default&quot;
outside a topicalizer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You have used a
&quot;default&quot; block that is neither inside a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop nor a &quot;given&quot; block.
(Note that this error is issued on exit from the
&quot;default&quot; block, so you won&rsquo;t get the error
if you use an explicit &quot;continue&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t determine class of
operator %s, assuming <small>BASEOP</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) This warning indicates
something wrong in the internals of perl. Perl was trying to
find the class (e.g. <small>LISTOP</small> ) of a particular
<small>OP,</small> and was unable to do so. This is likely
to be due to a bug in the perl internals, or due to a bug in
<small>XS</small> code which manipulates perl optrees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit: %s
is not a regular file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) You tried to use
the <b>&minus;i</b> switch on a special file, such as a file
in /dev, a <small>FIFO</small> or an uneditable directory.
The file was ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit on
%s: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) The creation of the
new file failed for the indicated reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do inplace edit: %s
would not be unique</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) Your filesystem
does not support filenames longer than 14 characters and
Perl was unable to create a unique filename during inplace
editing with the <b>&minus;i</b> switch. The file was
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do
%s(&quot;%s&quot;) on non&minus;UTF&minus;8 locale; resolved
to &quot;%s&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W locale) You are 1) running
under &quot;&quot;use locale&quot;&quot;; 2) the current
locale is not a <small>UTF&minus;8</small> one; 3) you tried
to do the designated case-change operation on the specified
Unicode character; and 4) the result of this operation would
mix Unicode and locale rules, which likely conflict. Mixing
of different rule types is forbidden, so the operation was
not done; instead the result is the indicated value, which
is the best available that uses entirely Unicode rules. That
turns out to almost always be the original character,
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is generally
a bad idea to mix non&minus;UTF&minus;8 locales and Unicode,
and this issue is one of the reasons why. This warning is
raised when Unicode rules would normally cause the result of
this operation to contain a character that is in the range
specified by the locale, 0..255, and hence is subject to the
locale&rsquo;s rules, not Unicode&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using locale purely for its characteristics related to
things like its numeric and time formatting (and not
&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;), consider using a restricted form of
the locale pragma (see &quot;The &quot;use locale&quot;
pragma&quot; in perllocale) like
&quot;&quot;use&nbsp;locale&nbsp;':not_characters'&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
failed case-changing operations done as a result of
case-insensitive &quot;/i&quot; regular expression matching
will show up in this warning as having the &quot;fc&quot;
operation (as that is what the regular expression engine
calls behind the scenes.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t do waitpid with
flags</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This machine doesn&rsquo;t
have either <b>waitpid()</b> or <b>wait4()</b>, so only
<b>waitpid()</b> without flags is emulated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t emulate &minus;%s
on #! line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The #! line specifies a
switch that doesn&rsquo;t make sense at this point. For
example, it&rsquo;d be kind of silly to put a
<b>&minus;x</b> on the #! line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t %s %s&minus;endian
%ss on this platform</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your platform&rsquo;s
byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian, or it
has a very strange pointer size. Packing and unpacking
big&minus; or little-endian floating point values and
pointers may not be possible. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t exec
&quot;%s&quot;: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W exec) A <b>system()</b>,
<b>exec()</b>, or piped open call could not execute the
named program for the indicated reason. Typical reasons
include: the permissions were wrong on the file, the file
wasn&rsquo;t found in $ENV{PATH}, the executable in question
was compiled for another architecture, or the #! line in a
script points to an interpreter that can&rsquo;t be run for
similar reasons. (Or maybe your system doesn&rsquo;t support
#! at all.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t exec %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to execute
the indicated program for you because that&rsquo;s what the
#! line said. If that&rsquo;s not what you wanted, you may
need to mention &quot;perl&quot; on the #! line
somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t execute %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the
<b>&minus;S</b> switch, but the copies of the script to
execute found in the <small>PATH</small> did not have
correct permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find an opnumber
for &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A string of a form
&quot;CORE::word&quot; was given to <b>prototype()</b>, but
there is no builtin with the name &quot;word&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find label %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You said to goto a label
that isn&rsquo;t mentioned anywhere that it&rsquo;s possible
for us to go to. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find %s on
<small>PATH</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the
<b>&minus;S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not
be found in the <small>PATH.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find %s on
<small>PATH,</small> &rsquo;.&rsquo; not in
<small>PATH</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the
<b>&minus;S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not
be found in the <small>PATH,</small> or at least not with
the correct permissions. The script exists in the current
directory, but <small>PATH</small> prohibits running it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find string
terminator %s anywhere before <small>EOF</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl strings can stretch
over multiple lines. This message means that the closing
delimiter was omitted. Because bracketed quotes count
nesting levels, the following is missing its final
parenthesis:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">print q(The
character '(' starts a side comment.);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
getting this error from a here-document, you may have
included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag
or there may not be a linebreak after it. A good
programmer&rsquo;s editor will have a way to help you find
these characters (or lack of characters). See perlop for the
full details on here-documents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t find Unicode
property definition &quot;%s&quot; <br>
Can&rsquo;t find Unicode property definition &quot;%s&quot;
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small><br>
HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The named property which
you specified via &quot;\p&quot; or &quot;\P&quot; is not
one known to Perl. Perhaps you misspelled the name? See
&quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in
perluniprops for a complete list of available official
properties. If it is a user-defined property it must have
been defined by the time the regular expression is
matched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you
didn&rsquo;t mean to use a Unicode property, escape the
&quot;\p&quot;, either by &quot;\\p&quot; (just the
&quot;\p&quot;) or by &quot;\Q\p&quot; (the rest of the
string, or until &quot;\E&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t fork: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A fatal error occurred
while trying to fork while opening a pipeline.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t fork, trying again
in 5 seconds</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pipe) A fork in a piped open
failed with <small>EAGAIN</small> and will be retried after
five seconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t get filespec
&minus; stale stat buffer?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> This arises because of the difference
between access checks under <small>VMS</small> and under the
Unix model Perl assumes. Under <small>VMS,</small> access
checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the stat
buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into
account. Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer
contains all the necessary information, and passes it,
instead of the filespec, to the access-checking routine. It
will try to retrieve the filespec using the device name and
<small>FID</small> present in the stat buffer, but this
works only if you haven&rsquo;t made a subsequent call to
the <small>CRTL</small> <b>stat()</b> routine, because the
device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning
appears, the name lookup failed, and the access-checking
routine gave up and returned <small>FALSE,</small> just to
be conservative. (Note: The access-checking routine knows
about the Perl &quot;stat&quot; operator and file tests, so
you shouldn&rsquo;t ever see this warning in response to a
Perl command; it arises only if some internal code takes
stat buffers lightly.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t get pipe mailbox
device name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> After creating a mailbox to act as a
pipe, Perl can&rsquo;t retrieve its name for later use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t get
<small>SYSGEN</small> parameter value for
<small>MAXBUF</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl asked $GETSYI how big you want your
mailbox buffers to be, and didn&rsquo;t get an answer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot;
into a binary or list expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;goto&quot;
statement was executed to jump into the middle of a binary
or list expression. You can&rsquo;t get there from here. The
reason for this restriction is that the interpreter would
get confused as to how many arguments there are, resulting
in stack corruption or crashes. This error occurs in cases
such as these:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">goto F; <br>
print do { F: }; # Can't jump into the arguments to print
<br>
goto G; <br>
$x + do { G: $y }; # How is + supposed to get its first
operand?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot;
into a &quot;defer&quot; block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;goto&quot;
statement was executed to jump into the scope of a
&quot;defer&quot; block. This is not permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot;
into a &quot;given&quot; block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;goto&quot;
statement was executed to jump into the middle of a
&quot;given&quot; block. You can&rsquo;t get there from
here. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot;
into the middle of a foreach loop</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;goto&quot;
statement was executed to jump into the middle of a foreach
loop. You can&rsquo;t get there from here. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;goto&quot;
out of a pseudo block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;goto&quot;
statement was executed to jump out of what might look like a
block, except that it isn&rsquo;t a proper block. This
usually occurs if you tried to jump out of a <b>sort()</b>
block or subroutine, which is a no-no. See &quot;goto&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine
from an eval&minus;%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;goto
subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used to jump out of an
eval &quot;string&quot; or block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine
from a sort sub (or similar callback)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;goto
subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used to jump out of the
comparison sub for a <b>sort()</b>, or from a similar
callback (such as the <b>reduce()</b> function in
List::Util).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine
outside a subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The deeply magical
&quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can only replace one
subroutine call for another. It can&rsquo;t manufacture one
out of whole cloth. In general you should be calling it out
of only an <small>AUTOLOAD</small> routine anyway. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t ignore signal
<small>CHLD,</small> forcing to default</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W signal) Perl has detected
that it is being run with the <small>SIGCHLD</small> signal
(sometimes known as <small>SIGCLD</small> ) disabled. Since
disabling this signal will interfere with proper
determination of exit status of child processes, Perl has
reset the signal to its default value. This situation
typically indicates that the parent program under which Perl
may be running (e.g. cron) is being very careless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t kill a non-numeric
process <small>ID</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Process identifiers must be
(signed) integers. It is a fatal error to attempt to
<b>kill()</b> an undefined, empty-string or otherwise
non-numeric process identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;last&quot;
outside a loop block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;last&quot;
statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there&rsquo;s this itty bitty problem called
there isn&rsquo;t a current block. Note that an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t count
as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block
given to <b>sort()</b>, <b>map()</b> or <b>grep()</b>. You
can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once. See &quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t linearize anonymous
symbol table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl tried to calculate the
method resolution order ( <small>MRO</small> ) of a package,
but failed because the package stash has no name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t load
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; for module %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The module you tried to
load failed to load a dynamic extension. This may either
mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is
incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is
known to happen between major versions of perl), or (more
likely) that your dynamic extension was built against an
older version of the library that is installed on your
system. You may need to rebuild your old dynamic
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t localize lexical
variable %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used local on a
variable name that was previously declared as a lexical
variable using &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;. This is
not allowed. If you want to localize a package variable of
the same name, qualify it with the package name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t localize through a
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You said something like
&quot;local $$ref&quot;, which Perl can&rsquo;t currently
handle, because when it goes to restore the old value of
whatever $ref pointed to after the scope of the
<b>local()</b> is finished, it can&rsquo;t be sure that $ref
will still be a reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You said to &quot;do&quot;
(or &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot;) a file that
couldn&rsquo;t be found. Perl looks for the file in all the
locations mentioned in @INC, unless the file name included
the full path to the file. Perhaps you need to set the
<small>PERL5LIB</small> or <small>PERL5OPT</small>
environment variable to say where the extra library is, or
maybe the script needs to add the library name to @INC. Or
maybe you just misspelled the name of the file. See
&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and lib.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate auto/%s.al
in @INC</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A function (or method) was
called in a package which allows autoload, but there is no
function to autoload. Most probable causes are a misprint in
a function/method name or a failure to &quot;AutoSplit&quot;
the file, say, by doing &quot;make install&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate loadable
object for module %s in @INC</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The module you loaded is
trying to load an external library, like for example,
<i>foo.so</i> or <i>bar.dll</i>, but the DynaLoader module
was unable to locate this library. See DynaLoader.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate object
method &quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called a method
correctly, and it correctly indicated a package functioning
as a class, but that package doesn&rsquo;t define that
particular method, nor does any of its base classes. See
perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate object
method &quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot; (perhaps
you forgot to <br>
load &quot;%s&quot;?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called a method on a
class that did not exist, and the method could not be found
in <small>UNIVERSAL.</small> This often means that a method
requires a package that has not been loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate package %s
for @%s::ISA</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) The @ISA array
contained the name of another package that doesn&rsquo;t
seem to exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t locate PerlIO%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use in
<b>open()</b> a PerlIO layer that does not exist, e.g. open(
<small>FH, &quot;</small> &gt;:nosuchlayer&quot;,
&quot;somefile&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t make list
assignment to %ENV on this system</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) List assignment to %ENV is
not supported on some systems, notably
<small>VMS.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t make loaded symbols
global on this platform while loading %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A module passed the flag
0x01 to <b>DynaLoader::dl_load_file()</b> to request that
symbols from the stated file are made available globally
within the process, but that functionality is not available
on this platform. Whilst the module likely will still work,
this may prevent the perl interpreter from loading other
XS-based extensions which need to link directly to functions
defined in the C or <small>XS</small> code in the stated
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t modify %s in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You aren&rsquo;t allowed to
assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try to change it,
such as with an auto-increment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t modify non-lvalue
subroutine call of &amp;%s <br>
Can&rsquo;t modify non-lvalue subroutine call of &amp;%s in
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Subroutines meant to be
used in lvalue context should be declared as such. See
&quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t modify reference to
%s in %s assignment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only a limited number of
constructs can be used as the argument to a reference
constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment, and what
you used was not one of them. See &quot;Assigning to
References&quot; in perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t modify reference to
localized parenthesized array in list <br>
assignment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Assigning to
&quot;\local(@array)&quot; or &quot;\(local @array)&quot; is
not supported, as it is not clear exactly what it should do.
If you meant to make @array refer to some other array, use
&quot;\@array = \@other_array&quot;. If you want to make the
elements of @array aliases of the scalars referenced on the
right-hand side, use &quot;\(@array) =
@scalar_refs&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t modify reference to
parenthesized hash in list assignment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Assigning to
&quot;\(%hash)&quot; is not supported. If you meant to make
%hash refer to some other hash, use &quot;\%hash =
\%other_hash&quot;. If you want to make the elements of
%hash into aliases of the scalars referenced on the
right-hand side, use a hash slice: &quot;\@hash{@keys} =
@those_scalar_refs&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t msgrcv to read-only
var</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The target of a msgrcv must
be modifiable to be used as a receive buffer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;next&quot;
outside a loop block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;next&quot;
statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn&rsquo;t a current block. Note that an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t count
as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block
given to <b>sort()</b>, <b>map()</b> or <b>grep()</b>. You
can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once. See &quot;next&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open %s: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) The implicit
opening of a file through use of the &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;
filehandle, either implicitly under the &quot;&minus;n&quot;
or &quot;&minus;p&quot; command-line switches, or
explicitly, failed for the indicated reason. Usually this is
because you don&rsquo;t have read permission for a file
which you named on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(F) You tried
to call perl with the <b>&minus;e</b> switch, but
<i>/dev/null</i> (or your operating system&rsquo;s
equivalent) could not be opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open a
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You tried to open a
scalar reference for reading or writing, using the
3&minus;arg <b>open()</b> syntax:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">open FH,
'&gt;', $ref;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">but your
version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this form of
open is not supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open bidirectional
pipe</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pipe) You tried to say
&quot;open(CMD, &quot;|cmd|&quot;)&quot;, which is not
supported. You can try any of several modules in the Perl
library to do this, such as IPC::Open2. Alternately, direct
the pipe&rsquo;s output to a file using &quot;&gt;&quot;,
and then read it in under a different file handle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open error file %s
as stderr</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified
after &rsquo;2&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;2&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the
command line for writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open input file %s
as stdin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified
after &rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; on the command line for
reading.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open output file %s
as stdout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the file specified
after &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; or &rsquo;&gt;&gt;&rsquo; on the
command line for writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open output pipe
(name: %s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl does its own command line
redirection, and couldn&rsquo;t open the pipe into which to
send data destined for stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t open perl script
&quot;%s&quot;: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The script you specified
can&rsquo;t be opened for the indicated reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies on the
shell&rsquo;s $PATH search, the &minus;S option causes perl
to do that search, so you don&rsquo;t have to type the path
or &quot;`which $scriptname`&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t read
<small>CRTL</small> environ</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl tried to read an element of %ENV
from the <small>CRTL</small> &rsquo;s internal environment
array and discovered the array was missing. You need to
figure out where your <small>CRTL</small> misplaced its
environ or define <i><small>PERL_ENV_TABLES</small></i> (see
perlvms) so that environ is not searched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t redeclare
&quot;%s&quot; in &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;my&quot;,
&quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; declaration was found
within another declaration, such as &quot;my ($x, my($y),
$z)&quot; or &quot;our (my $x)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;redo&quot;
outside a loop block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;redo&quot;
statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn&rsquo;t a current block. Note that an
&quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block doesn&rsquo;t count
as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn&rsquo;t a block
given to <b>sort()</b>, <b>map()</b> or <b>grep()</b>. You
can usually double the curlies to get the same effect
though, because the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once. See &quot;redo&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t remove %s: %s,
skipping file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S inplace) You requested an
inplace edit without creating a backup file. Perl was unable
to remove the original file to replace it with the modified
file. The file was left unmodified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t rename in-place
work file &rsquo;%s&rsquo; to &rsquo;%s&rsquo;: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When closed implicitly, the
temporary file for in-place editing couldn&rsquo;t be
renamed to the original filename.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t rename %s to %s:
%s, skipping file</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The rename done by the
<b>&minus;i</b> switch failed for some reason, probably
because you don&rsquo;t have write permission to the
directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t reopen input pipe
(name: %s) in binary mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried
to reopen it to accept binary data. Alas, it failed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t represent character
for Ox%X on this platform</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) There is a hard limit to
how big a character code point can be due to the fundamental
properties of <small>UTF&minus;8,</small> especially on
<small>EBCDIC</small> platforms. The given code point
exceeds that. The only work-around is to not use such a
large code point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t reset %ENV on this
system</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called
&quot;reset('E')&quot; or similar, which tried to reset all
variables in the current package beginning with
&quot;E&quot;. In the main package, that includes %ENV.
Resetting %ENV is not supported on some systems, notably
<small>VMS.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t resolve method
&quot;%s&quot; overloading &quot;%s&quot; in package
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F)(P) Error resolving
overloading specified by a method name (as opposed to a
subroutine reference): no such method callable via the
package. If the method name is &quot;???&quot;, this is an
internal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t return %s from
lvalue subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl detected an attempt to
return illegal lvalues (such as temporary or readonly
values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue. This is not
allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t return outside a
subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The return statement was
executed in mainline code, that is, where there was no
subroutine call to return out of. See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t return %s to lvalue
scalar context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to return a
complete array or hash from an lvalue subroutine, but you
called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think you
meant to return only one value. You probably meant to write
parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell
Perl that the call should be in list context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t take log of %g</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) For ordinary real numbers,
you can&rsquo;t take the logarithm of a negative number or
zero. There&rsquo;s a Math::Complex package that comes
standard with Perl, though, if you really want to do that
for the negative numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t take sqrt of %g</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) For ordinary real numbers,
you can&rsquo;t take the square root of a negative number.
There&rsquo;s a Math::Complex package that comes standard
with Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t undef active
subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t undefine a
routine that&rsquo;s currently running. You can, however,
redefine it while it&rsquo;s running, and you can even undef
the redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.
Go figure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t unweaken a
nonreference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You attempted to unweaken
something that was not a reference. Only references can be
unweakened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t upgrade %s (%d) to
%d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal sv_upgrade
routine adds &quot;members&quot; to an <small>SV,</small>
making it into a more specialized kind of <small>SV.</small>
The top several <small>SV</small> types are so specialized,
however, that they cannot be interconverted. This message
indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; after &minus;mname</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to call perl with
the <b>&minus;m</b> switch, but you put something other than
&quot;=&quot; after the module name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use a hash as a
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use a hash as
a reference, as in
&quot;%foo&minus;&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot; or
&quot;%$ref&minus;&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}&quot;. Versions of
perl &lt;= 5.22.0 used to allow this syntax, but
shouldn&rsquo;t have. This was deprecated in perl 5.6.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use an array as a
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use an array
as a reference, as in &quot;@foo&minus;&gt;[23]&quot; or
&quot;@$ref&minus;&gt;[99]&quot;. Versions of perl &lt;=
5.22.0 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&rsquo;t have.
This was deprecated in perl 5.6.1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use anonymous
symbol table for method lookup</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The internal routine that
does method lookup was handed a symbol table that
doesn&rsquo;t have a name. Symbol tables can become
anonymous for example by undefining stashes: &quot;undef
%Some::Package::&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use an undefined
value as %s reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A value used as either a
hard reference or a symbolic reference must be a defined
value. This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use bareword
(&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in
use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only hard references are
allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;. Symbolic references are
disallowed. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use %! because
Errno.pm is not available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The first time the
&quot;%!&quot; hash is used, perl automatically loads the
Errno.pm module. The Errno module is expected to tie the %!
hash to provide symbolic names for $! errno values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use both
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo; after type
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A type cannot be forced to
have both big-endian and little-endian byte-order at the
same time, so this combination of modifiers is not allowed.
See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use
&rsquo;defined(@array)&rsquo; (Maybe you should just omit
the <b>defined()</b>?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) <b>defined()</b> is not
useful on arrays because it checks for an undefined
<i>scalar</i> value. If you want to see if the array is
empty, just use &quot;if (@array) { # not empty }&quot; for
example.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use
&rsquo;defined(%hash)&rsquo; (Maybe you should just omit the
<b>defined()</b>?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) &quot;defined()&quot; is
not usually right on hashes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Although
&quot;defined %hash&quot; is false on a plain not-yet-used
hash, it becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances,
including iterators, weak references, stash names, even
remaining true after &quot;undef %hash&quot;. These things
make &quot;defined %hash&quot; fairly useless in practice,
so it now generates a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a check for
non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean
context (see &quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if (%hash) {
<br>
# not empty <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you had
&quot;defined %Foo::Bar::QUUX&quot; to check whether such a
package variable exists then that&rsquo;s never really been
reliable, and isn&rsquo;t a good way to enquire about the
features of a package, or whether it&rsquo;s loaded,
etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use %s for loop
variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The parser got confused
when trying to parse a &quot;foreach&quot; loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use global %s in
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to declare a
magical variable as a lexical variable. This is not allowed,
because the magic can be tied to only one location (namely
the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to
have variables in your program that looked like magical
variables but weren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; in a group with different byte-order in
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You attempted to force a
different byte-order on a type that is already inside a
group with a byte-order modifier. For example you cannot
force little-endianness on a type that is inside a
big-endian group.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use &quot;my
%s&quot; in sort comparison</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The global variables $a and
$b are reserved for sort comparisons. You mentioned $a or $b
in the same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator, and the
variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or
rename the lexical variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use %s ref as %s
ref</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve mixed up your
reference types. You have to dereference a reference of the
type needed. You can use the <b>ref()</b> function to test
the type of the reference, if need be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use string
(&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in
use <br>
Can&rsquo;t use string (&quot;%s&quot;...) as %s ref while
&quot;strict refs&quot; in use</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve told Perl to
dereference a string, something which &quot;use strict&quot;
blocks to prevent it happening accidentally. See
&quot;Symbolic references&quot; in perlref. This can be
triggered by an &quot;@&quot; or &quot;$&quot; in a
double-quoted string immediately before interpolating a
variable, for example in &quot;user @$twitter_id&quot;,
which says to treat the contents of $twitter_id as an array
reference; use a &quot;\&quot; to have a literal
&quot;@&quot; symbol followed by the contents of
$twitter_id: &quot;user \@$twitter_id&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use subscript on
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The compiler tried to
interpret a bracketed expression as a subscript. But to the
left of the brackets was an expression that didn&rsquo;t
look like a hash or array reference, or anything else
subscriptable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use \%c to mean $%c
in expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) In an ordinary
expression, backslash is a unary operator that creates a
reference to its argument. The use of backslash to indicate
a backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part
of a regular expression pattern. Trying to do this in
ordinary Perl code produces a value that prints out looking
like <b><small>SCALAR</small></b> (0xdecaf). Use the $1 form
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t weaken a
nonreference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You attempted to weaken
something that was not a reference. Only references can be
weakened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t &quot;when&quot;
outside a topicalizer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You have used a
<b>when()</b> block that is neither inside a
&quot;foreach&quot; loop nor a &quot;given&quot; block.
(Note that this error is issued on exit from the
&quot;when&quot; block, so you won&rsquo;t get the error if
the match fails, or if you use an explicit
&quot;continue&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t x= to read-only
value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to repeat a
constant value (often the undefined value) with an
assignment operator, which implies modifying the value
itself. Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary,
and repeat that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character following
&quot;\c&quot; must be printable <small>ASCII</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) In &quot;\c<i>X</i>&quot;,
<i>X</i> must be a printable (non-control)
<small>ASCII</small> character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
<small>ASCII</small> characters that don&rsquo;t map to
control characters are discouraged, and will generate the
warning (when enabled) &quot;&quot;\c%c&quot; is more
clearly written simply as &quot;%s&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character following \%c must be
&rsquo;{&rsquo; or a single-character Unicode <br>
property name in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) (In the above the %c is
replaced by either &quot;p&quot; or &quot;P&quot;.) You
specified something that isn&rsquo;t a legal Unicode
property name. Most Unicode properties are specified by
&quot;\p{...}&quot;. But if the name is a single character
one, the braces may be omitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character in &rsquo;C&rsquo;

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unpack) You tried something
like</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">unpack(&quot;H&quot;,

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">where the

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You defined a character
name which had multiple space characters in a row. Change
them to single spaces. Usually these names are defined in
the &quot;:alias&quot; import argument to &quot;use
charnames&quot;, but they could be defined by a translator
installed into $^H{charnames}. See &quot; <small>CUSTOM
ALIASES&quot;</small> in charnames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chdir()</b> on unopened

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried
<b>chdir()</b> on a filehandle that was never opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;\c%c&quot; is more
clearly written simply as &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) The
&quot;\c<i>X</i>&quot; construct is intended to be a way to
specify non-printable characters. You used it for a
printable one, which is better written as simply itself,
perhaps preceded by a backslash for non-word characters.
Doing it the way you did is not portable between
<small>ASCII</small> and <small>EBCDIC</small>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cloning substitution context is

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to close
a filehandle that was never opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Closure prototype called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) If a closure has
attributes, the subroutine passed to an attribute handler is
the prototype that is cloned when a new closure is created.
This subroutine cannot be called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">\C no longer supported in
regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The \C character class used
to allow a match of single byte within a multi-byte
utf&minus;8 character, but was removed in v5.24 as it broke
encapsulation and its implementation was extremely buggy. If
you really need to process the individual bytes, you
probably want to convert your string to one where each
underlying byte is stored as a character, with
<b>utf8::encode()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Code missing after
&rsquo;/&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had a
(sub&minus;)template that ends with a &rsquo;/&rsquo;. There
must be another template code following the slash. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Code point 0x%X is not Unicode,
and not portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S non_unicode portable) You
had a code point that has never been in any standard, so it
is likely that languages other than Perl will
<small>NOT</small> understand it. This code point also will
not fit in a 32&minus;bit word on <small>ASCII</small>
platforms and therefore is non-portable between systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At one time, it

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Acceptance of
these code points is a Perl extension, and you should expect
that nothing other than Perl can handle them; Perl itself on
<small>EBCDIC</small> platforms before v5.24 does not handle
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl also makes
no guarantees that the representation of these code points
won&rsquo;t change at some point in the future, say when
machines become available that have larger than a

these, written by an older Perl might require conversion
before being readable by a newer Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Code point 0x%X is not Unicode,
may not be portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S non_unicode) You had a code
point above the Unicode maximum of U+10FFFF.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl allows
strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points, but
these may not be accepted by other languages/systems.
Further, even if these languages/systems accept these large
code points, they may have chosen a different representation
for them than the UTF&minus;8&minus;like one that Perl has,
which would mean files are not exchangeable between them and
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On
<small>EBCDIC</small> platforms, code points above
0x3FFF_FFFF have a different representation in Perl v5.24

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Complex regular subexpression
recursion limit (%d) exceeded</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) The regular
expression engine uses recursion in complex situations where
back-tracking is required. Recursion depth is limited to
32766, or perhaps less in architectures where the stack
cannot grow arbitrarily. (&quot;Simple&quot; and
&quot;medium&quot; situations are handled without recursion
and are not subject to a limit.) Try shortening the string
under examination; looping in Perl code (e.g. with

engine; or rewriting the regular expression so that it is
simpler or backtracks less. (See perlfaq2 for information on

declared using the &quot;use constant&quot; pragma) is being
dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of reference.
The message indicates the type of reference that was
expected. This usually indicates a syntax error in
dereferencing the constant value. See &quot;Constant
Functions&quot; in perlsub and constant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Constants from lexical
variables potentially modified elsewhere are no <br>
longer permitted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You wrote something
like</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">my $var; <br>
$sub = sub () { $var };</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">but $var is
referenced elsewhere and could be modified after the
&quot;sub&quot; expression is evaluated. Either it is
explicitly modified elsewhere (&quot;$var = 3&quot;) or it
is passed to a subroutine or to an operator like
&quot;printf&quot; or &quot;map&quot;, which may or may not
modify the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Traditionally,
Perl has captured the value of the variable at that point
and turned the subroutine into a constant eligible for
inlining. In those cases where the variable can be modified
elsewhere, this breaks the behavior of closures, in which
the subroutine captures the variable itself, rather than its
value, so future changes to the variable are reflected in
the subroutine&rsquo;s return value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This usage was
deprecated, and as of Perl 5.32 is no longer allowed, making
it possible to change the behavior in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you intended
for the subroutine to be eligible for inlining, then make
sure the variable is not referenced elsewhere, possibly by
copying it:</p>

$sub = sub () { $var2 };</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you do want
this subroutine to be a closure that reflects future changes

$sub = sub () { return $var };</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Constant subroutine %s

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W redefine)(S) You redefined a
subroutine which had previously been eligible for inlining.
See &quot;Constant Functions&quot; in perlsub for commentary
and workarounds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Constant subroutine %s

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The parser found
inconsistencies either while attempting to define an
overloaded constant, or when trying to find the character

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::const_attr)
The &quot;const&quot; attribute is experimental. If you want
to use the feature, disable the warning with &quot;no
warnings 'experimental::const_attr'&quot;, but know that in
doing so you are taking the risk that your code may break in
a future Perl version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">:const is not permitted on
named subroutines</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;const&quot;
attribute causes an anonymous subroutine to be run and its
value captured at the time that it is cloned. Named
subroutines are not cloned like this, so the attribute does
not make sense on them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Copy method did not return a

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The method which overloads
&quot;=&quot; is buggy. See &quot;Copy Constructor&quot; in
overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&amp;CORE::%s cannot be called

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to call a
subroutine in the &quot;CORE::&quot; namespace with &amp;foo
syntax or through a reference. Some subroutines in this
package cannot yet be called that way, but must be called as
barewords. Something like this will work:</p>

This warning is emitted if you use a reference constructor
on the right-hand side of &quot;my&quot;, &quot;state&quot;,
&quot;our&quot;, or &quot;local&quot;. Simply suppress the
warning if you want to use the feature, but know that in

Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W recursion) This subroutine
has called itself (directly or indirectly) 100 times more

too long</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) In a here document
construct like &quot;&lt;&lt;FOO&quot;, the label
&quot;FOO&quot; is too long for Perl to handle. You have to
be seriously twisted to write code that triggers this
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>DESTROY</small> created
new reference to dead object &rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A <b><small>DESTROY</small>
()</b> method created a new reference to the object which is
just being DESTROYed. Perl is confused, and prefers to abort
rather than to create a dangling reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Did not produce a valid

error&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s did not return a true

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A required (or used) file
must return a true value to indicate that it compiled
correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.
It&rsquo;s traditional to end such a file with a
&quot;1;&quot;, though any true value would do. See
&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Did you mean &amp;%s

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You probably referred
to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as $FOO or some such.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Did you mean &quot;local&quot;
instead of &quot;our&quot;?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W shadow) Remember that
&quot;our&quot; does not localize the declared global
variable. You have declared it again in the same lexical
scope, which seems superfluous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Did you mean $ or @ instead of
%?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You probably said
%hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key} or @hash{@keys}. On
the other hand, maybe you just meant %hash and got carried
away.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Died</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You passed <b>die()</b> an

<p style="margin-left:11%;">do &quot;%s&quot; failed,
&rsquo;.&rsquo; is no longer in @INC; did you mean do
&quot;./%s&quot;?</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) Previously
&quot; do &quot;somefile&quot;; &quot; would search the
current directory for the specified file. Since perl
v5.26.0, <i>.</i> has been removed from @INC by default, so
this is no longer true. To search the current directory (and
only the current directory) you can write &quot; do
&quot;./somefile&quot;; &quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Don&rsquo;t know how to get

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Downgrading a use
<small>VERSION</small> declaration to below v5.11 is
deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S deprecated) This warning is
emitted on a &quot;use VERSION&quot; statement that requests
a version below v5.11 (when the effects of &quot;use
strict&quot; would be disabled), after a previous
declaration of one having a larger number (which would have
enabled these effects). Because of a change to the way that
&quot;use VERSION&quot; interacts with the strictness flags,
this is no longer supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Do you need to predeclare
%s?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) This is an educated
guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s found
where operator expected&quot;. It often means a subroutine
or module name is being referenced that hasn&rsquo;t been
declared yet. This may be because of ordering problems in
your file, or because of a missing &quot;sub&quot;,
&quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot;
statement. If you&rsquo;re referencing something that
isn&rsquo;t defined yet, you don&rsquo;t actually have to
define the subroutine or package before the current
location. You can use an empty &quot;sub foo;&quot; or
&quot;package <small>FOO</small> ;&quot; to enter a
&quot;forward&quot; declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>dump()</b> must be written

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the obsolete
&quot;dump()&quot; built-in function. That was deprecated in
Perl 5.8.0. As of Perl 5.30 it must be written in fully
qualified format: &quot;CORE::dump()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S malloc) An internal routine
called <b>free()</b> on something that had already been
freed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Duplicate modifier

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unpack) You have applied the
same modifier more than once after a type in a pack
template. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">each on anonymous %s will
always start from the beginning</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You called each on
an anonymous hash or array. Since a new hash or array is
created each time, <b>each()</b> will restart iterating over
your hash or array every time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">elseif should be elsif</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) There is no keyword
&quot;elseif&quot; in Perl because Larry thinks it&rsquo;s
ugly. Your code will be interpreted as an attempt to call a
method named &quot;elseif&quot; for the class returned by
the following block. This is unlikely to be what you
want.</p>

Empty \%c{} <br>
Empty \%c{} in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) (only under

<p style="margin-left:11%;">${^ENCODING} is no longer

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The special variable
&quot;${^ENCODING}&quot;, formerly used to implement the

Perl 5.26.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Setting it to

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%ENV is aliased to %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;re running under
taint mode, and the %ENV variable has been aliased to
another hash, so it doesn&rsquo;t reflect anymore the state
of the program&rsquo;s environment. This is potentially
insecure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Error converting file
specification %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Because Perl may have to deal with file
specifications in either <small>VMS</small> or Unix syntax,
it converts them to a single form when it must operate on
them directly. Either you&rsquo;ve passed an invalid file
specification to Perl, or you&rsquo;ve found a case the
conversion routines don&rsquo;t handle. Drat.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Error %s in expansion of %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error was encountered in
handling a user-defined property (&quot;User-Defined
Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode). These are
programmer written subroutines, hence subject to errors that
may prevent them from compiling or running. The calls to
these subs are &quot;eval&quot;&rsquo;d, and if there is a
failure, this message is raised, using the contents of $@
from the failed &quot;eval&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another
possibility is that tainted data was encountered somewhere
in the chain of expanding the property. If so, the message
wording will indicate that this is the problem. See
&quot;Insecure user-defined property %s&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Eval-group in insecure regular
expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl detected tainted data
when trying to compile a regular expression that contains
the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion, which is
unsafe. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre, and
perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Eval-group not allowed at
runtime, use re &rsquo;eval&rsquo; in regex m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl tried to compile a
regular expression containing the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot;
zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values. Since that is a
security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may
still do this by using the &quot;re 'eval'&quot; pragma or
by explicitly building the pattern from an interpolated
string at run time and using that in an <b>eval()</b>. See
&quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Eval-group not allowed, use re
&rsquo;eval&rsquo; in regex m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A regular expression
contained the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion,

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The contents of a &lt;&gt;
operator may not exceed the maximum size of a Perl

of filenames, try using the <b>glob()</b> operator, or put
the filenames into a variable and glob that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">exec? I&rsquo;m not *that* kind

&quot;shift&quot;, &quot;splice&quot;, &quot;unshift&quot;,
and &quot;values&quot; to be called with a scalar argument.
This experiment is considered unsuccessful, and has been

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Experimental subroutine
signatures not enabled</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) To use subroutine
signatures, you must first enable them:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use feature
&quot;signatures&quot;; <br>
sub foo ($left, $right) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Explicit blessing to
&rsquo;&rsquo; (assuming package main)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You are blessing a
reference to a zero length string. This has the effect of
blessing the reference into the package main. This is
usually not what you want. Consider providing a default
target package, e.g. bless($ref, $p ||
&rsquo;MyPackage&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: Expression syntax</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check
the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s failed--call queue
aborted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An untrapped exception was
raised while executing a <small>UNITCHECK, CHECK,
INIT,</small> or <small>END</small> subroutine. Processing
of the remainder of the queue of such routines has been
prematurely ended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Failed to close in-place work
file %s: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Closing an output file from
in-place editing, as with the &quot;&minus;i&quot;
command-line switch, failed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">False [] range &quot;%s&quot;
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp)(F) A character class
range must start and end at a literal character, not another
character class like &quot;\d&quot; or
&quot;[:alpha:]&quot;. The &quot;&minus;&quot; in your false
range is interpreted as a literal &quot;&minus;&quot;. In a
&quot;(?[...])&quot; construct, this is an error, rather
than a warning. Consider quoting the &quot;&minus;&quot;,
&quot;\&minus;&quot;. The &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> shows whereabouts in the regular
expression the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Fatal <small>VMS</small> error
(status=%d) at %s, line %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Something untoward happened in a
<small>VMS</small> system service or <small>RTL</small>
routine; Perl&rsquo;s exit status should provide more
details. The filename in &quot;at %s&quot; and the line
number in &quot;line %d&quot; tell you which section of the
Perl source code is distressed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fcntl is not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine apparently
doesn&rsquo;t implement <b>fcntl()</b>. What is this, a
<small>PDP&minus;11</small> or something?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>FETCHSIZE</small>
returned a negative value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A tied array claimed to
have a negative number of elements, which is not
possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Field too wide in
&rsquo;u&rsquo; format in pack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pack) Each line in an
uuencoded string starts with a length indicator which
can&rsquo;t encode values above 63. So there is no point in
asking for a line length bigger than that. Perl will behave
as if you specified &quot;u63&quot; as the format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Filehandle %s opened only for
input</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You tried to write on a
read-only filehandle. If you intended it to be a read-write
filehandle, you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with
&quot;&lt;&quot; or nothing. If you intended only to write
the file, use &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;. See
&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Filehandle %s opened only for
output</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You tried to read from a
filehandle opened only for writing, If you intended it to be
a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it with
&quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or
&quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with &quot;&gt;&quot;. If
you intended only to read from the file, use
&quot;&lt;&quot;. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc. Another
possibility is that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0
(also known as <small>STDIN</small> ) for output (maybe you
closed <small>STDIN</small> earlier?).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Filehandle %s reopened as %s
only for input</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You opened for reading a
filehandle that got the same filehandle id as
<small>STDOUT</small> or <small>STDERR.</small> This
occurred because you closed <small>STDOUT</small> or
<small>STDERR</small> previously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Filehandle <small>STDIN</small>
reopened as %s only for output</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) You opened for writing a
filehandle that got the same filehandle id as
<small>STDIN.</small> This occurred because you closed
<small>STDIN</small> previously.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Final $ should be \$ or
$name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You must now decide whether
the final $ in a string was meant to be a literal dollar
sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that happens
to be missing. So you have to put either the backslash or
the name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">defer is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::defer) The
&quot;defer&quot; block modifier is experimental. If you
want to use the feature, disable the warning with &quot;no
warnings 'experimental::defer'&quot;, but know that in doing
so you are taking the risk that your code may break in a
future Perl version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>flock()</b> on closed
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) The filehandle
you&rsquo;re attempting to <b>flock()</b> got itself closed
some time before now. Check your control flow.
<b>flock()</b> operates on filehandles. Are you attempting
to call <b>flock()</b> on a dirhandle by the same name?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">for my (...) is
experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::for_list) This
warning is emitted if you use &quot;for&quot; to iterate
multiple values at a time. This syntax is currently
experimental and its behaviour may change in future releases
of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Format not terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A format must be terminated
by a line with a solitary dot. Perl got to the end of your
file without finding such a line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Format %s redefined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W redefine) You redefined a
format. To suppress this warning, say</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
no warnings 'redefine'; <br>
eval &quot;format NAME =...&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Found = in conditional, should
be ==</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You said</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if ($foo =
123)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">when you
meant</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if ($foo ==
123)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(or something
like that).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s found where operator
expected</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows
whether to expect a term or an operator. If it sees what it
knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an operator,
it gives you this warning. Usually it indicates that an
operator or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gdbm store returned %d, errno
%d, key &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning from the
GDBM_File extension that a store failed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gethostent not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your C library apparently
doesn&rsquo;t implement <b>gethostent()</b>, probably
because if it did, it&rsquo;d feel morally obligated to
return every hostname on the Internet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">get%<b>sname()</b> on closed
socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to get a
socket or peer socket name on a closed socket. Did you
forget to check the return value of your <b>socket()</b>
call?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">getpwnam returned invalid
<small>UIC</small> %#o for user &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> The call to &quot;sys$getuai&quot;
underlying the &quot;getpwnam&quot; operator returned an
invalid <small>UIC.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>getsockopt()</b> on closed
socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to get a
socket option on a closed socket. Did you forget to check
the return value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See
&quot;getsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">given is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::smartmatch)
&quot;given&quot; depends on smartmatch, which is
experimental, so its behavior may change or even be removed
in any future release of perl. See the explanation under
&quot;Experimental Details on given and when&quot; in
perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Global symbol &quot;%s&quot;
requires explicit package name (did you forget to <br>
declare &quot;my %s&quot;?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You&rsquo;ve said &quot;use
strict&quot; or &quot;use strict vars&quot;, which indicates
that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using
&quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;), declared beforehand
using &quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to say which
package the global variable is in (using
&quot;::&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">glob failed (%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S glob) Something went wrong
with the external program(s) used for &quot;glob&quot; and
&quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot;. Usually, this means that you
supplied a &quot;glob&quot; pattern that caused the external
program to fail and exit with a nonzero status. If the
message indicates that the abnormal exit resulted in a
coredump, this may also mean that your csh (C shell) is
broken. If so, you should change all of the csh-related
variables in config.sh: If you have tcsh, make the variables
refer to it as if it were csh (e.g.
&quot;full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'&quot;); otherwise, make them
all empty (except that &quot;d_csh&quot; should be 'undef')
so that Perl will think csh is missing. In either case,
after editing config.sh, run &quot;./Configure
&minus;S&quot; and rebuild Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Glob not terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer saw a left angle
bracket in a place where it was expecting a term, so
it&rsquo;s looking for the corresponding right angle
bracket, and not finding it. Chances are you left some
needed parentheses out earlier in the line, and you really
meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gmtime(%f) failed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called
&quot;gmtime&quot; with a number that it could not handle:
too large, too small, or NaN. The returned value is
&quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gmtime(%f) too large</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called
&quot;gmtime&quot; with a number that was larger than it can
reliably handle and &quot;gmtime&quot; probably returned the
wrong date. This warning is also triggered with NaN (the
special not-a-number value).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gmtime(%f) too small</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called
&quot;gmtime&quot; with a number that was smaller than it
can reliably handle and &quot;gmtime&quot; probably returned
the wrong date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Got an error from
DosAllocMem</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>OS/2.</small> Most probably you&rsquo;re using an
obsolete version of Perl, and this should not happen
anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">goto must have label</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Unlike with
&quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;, you&rsquo;re not
allowed to goto an unspecified destination. See
&quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Goto undefined subroutine%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to call a
subroutine with &quot;goto &amp;sub&quot; syntax, but the
indicated subroutine hasn&rsquo;t been defined, or if it
was, it has since been undefined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Group name must start with a
non-digit word character in regex; marked <br>
by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Group names must follow the
rules for perl identifiers, meaning they must start with a
non-digit word character. A common cause of this error is
using (?&amp;0) instead of (?0). See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">()&minus;group starts with a
count</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A ()&minus;group started
with a count. A count is supposed to follow something: a
template character or a ()&minus;group. See &quot;pack&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s had compilation errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The final summary message
when a &quot;perl &minus;c&quot; fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Had to create %s
unexpectedly</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) A routine asked
for a symbol from a symbol table that ought to have existed
already, but for some reason it didn&rsquo;t, and had to be
created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s has too many errors</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The parser has given up
trying to parse the program after 10 errors. Further error
messages would likely be uninformative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hexadecimal float: exponent
overflow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) The hexadecimal
floating point has a larger exponent than the floating point
supports.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hexadecimal float: exponent
underflow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) The hexadecimal
floating point has a smaller exponent than the floating
point supports. With the <small>IEEE 754</small> floating
point, this may also mean that the subnormals (formerly
known as denormals) are being used, which may or may not be
an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hexadecimal float: internal
error (%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Something went horribly bad
in hexadecimal float handling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hexadecimal float: mantissa
overflow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) The hexadecimal
floating point literal had more bits in the mantissa (the
part between the 0x and the exponent, also known as the
fraction or the significand) than the floating point
supports.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hexadecimal float: precision
loss</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) The hexadecimal
floating point had internally more digits than could be
output. This can be caused by unsupported long double
formats, or by 64&minus;bit integers not being available
(needed to retrieve the digits under some
configurations).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hexadecimal float: unsupported
long double format</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You have configured Perl to
use long doubles but the internals of the long double format
are unknown; therefore the hexadecimal float output is
impossible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Hexadecimal number &gt;
0xffffffff non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) The hexadecimal
number you specified is larger than 2**32&minus;1
(4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See
perlport for more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Identifier too long</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl limits identifiers
(names for variables, functions, etc.) to about 250
characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
names (like $A::B). You&rsquo;ve exceeded Perl&rsquo;s
limits. Future versions of Perl are likely to eliminate
these arbitrary limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ignoring zero length \N{} in
character class in regex; marked by <br>
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) Named Unicode
character escapes (&quot;\N{...}&quot;) may return a
zero-length sequence. When such an escape is used in a
character class its behavior is not well defined. Check that
the correct escape has been used, and the correct charname
handler is in scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal %s digit
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W digit) Here %s is one of
&quot;binary&quot;, &quot;octal&quot;, or &quot;hex&quot;.
You may have tried to use a digit other than one that is
legal for the given type, such as only 0 and 1 for binary.
For octals, this is raised only if the illegal character is
an &rsquo;8&rsquo; or &rsquo;9&rsquo;. For hex,
&rsquo;A&rsquo; &minus; &rsquo;F&rsquo; and &rsquo;a&rsquo;
&minus; &rsquo;f&rsquo; are legal. Interpretation of the
number stopped just before the offending digit or
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal binary digit
&rsquo;%c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a digit other than
0 or 1 in a binary number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal character after
&rsquo;_&rsquo; in prototype for %s : %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W illegalproto) An illegal
character was found in a prototype declaration. The
&rsquo;_&rsquo; in a prototype must be followed by a
&rsquo;;&rsquo;, indicating the rest of the parameters are
optional, or one of &rsquo;@&rsquo; or &rsquo;%&rsquo;,
since those two will accept 0 or more final parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal character \%o (carriage
return)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl normally treats
carriage returns in the program text as it would any other
whitespace, which means you should never see this error when
Perl was built using standard options. For some reason, your
version of Perl appears to have been built without this
support. Talk to your Perl administrator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal character following
sigil in a subroutine signature</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A parameter in a subroutine
signature contained an unexpected character following the
&quot;$&quot;, &quot;@&quot; or &quot;%&quot; sigil
character. Normally the sigil should be followed by the
variable name or &quot;=&quot; etc. Perhaps you are trying
use a prototype while in the scope of &quot;use feature
'signatures'&quot;? For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub foo ($$) {}
# legal &minus; a prototype <br>
use feature 'signatures; <br>
sub foo ($$) {} # illegal &minus; was expecting a signature
<br>
sub foo ($a, $b) <br>
:prototype($$) {} # legal</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal character in prototype
for %s : %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W illegalproto) An illegal
character was found in a prototype declaration. Legal
characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ], &amp;, \,
and +. Perhaps you were trying to write a subroutine
signature but didn&rsquo;t enable that feature first
(&quot;use feature 'signatures'&quot;), so your signature
was instead interpreted as a bad prototype.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal declaration of
anonymous subroutine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When using the
&quot;sub&quot; keyword to construct an anonymous
subroutine, you must always specify a block of code. See
perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal declaration of
subroutine %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A subroutine was not
declared correctly. See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal division by zero</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to divide a
number by 0. Either something was wrong in your logic, or
you need to put a conditional in to guard against
meaningless input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal modulus zero</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to divide a
number by 0 to get the remainder. Most numbers don&rsquo;t
take to this kindly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal number of bits in
vec</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The number of bits in
<b>vec()</b> (the third argument) must be a power of two
from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal octal digit
&rsquo;%c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an
octal number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal operator following
parameter in a subroutine signature</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A parameter in a subroutine
signature, was followed by something other than
&quot;=&quot; introducing a default, &quot;,&quot; or
&quot;)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use feature
'signatures'; <br>
sub foo ($=1) {} # legal <br>
sub foo ($a = 1) {} # legal <br>
sub foo ($a += 1) {} # illegal <br>
sub foo ($a == 1) {} # illegal</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal pattern in regex;
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You wrote something
like</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(?+foo)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;+&quot; is valid only when followed by digits,
indicating a capturing group. See
&quot;(?<i>PARNO</i>)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal suidscript</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The script run under
suidperl was somehow illegal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal switch in
<small>PERL5OPT:</small> &minus;%c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The <small>PERL5OPT</small>
environment variable may only be used to set the following
switches: <b>&minus;[CDIMUdmtw]</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal user-defined property
name</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified a
Unicode-like property name in a regular expression pattern
(using &quot;\p{}&quot; or &quot;\P{}&quot;) that Perl knows
isn&rsquo;t an official Unicode property, and was likely
meant to be a user-defined property name, but it can&rsquo;t
be one of those, as they must begin with either
&quot;In&quot; or &quot;Is&quot;. Check the spelling. See
also &quot;Can&rsquo;t find Unicode property definition
&quot;%s&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ill-formed <small>CRTL</small>
environ value &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) A warning peculiar
to <small>VMS.</small> Perl tried to read the
<small>CRTL</small> &rsquo;s internal environ array, and
encountered an element without the &quot;=&quot; delimiter
used to separate keys from values. The element is
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Ill-formed message in
prime_env_iter: |%s|</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) A warning peculiar
to <small>VMS.</small> Perl tried to read a logical name or
<small>CLI</small> symbol definition when preparing to
iterate over %ENV, and didn&rsquo;t see the expected
delimiter between key and value, so the line was
ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(in cleanup) %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) This prefix usually
indicates that a <b><small>DESTROY</small> ()</b> method
raised the indicated exception. Since destructors are
usually called by the system at arbitrary points during
execution, and often a vast number of times, the warning is
issued only once for any number of failures that would
otherwise result in the same message being repeated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Failure of user
callbacks dispatched using the &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; flag
could also result in this warning. See &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot;
in perlcall.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Implicit use of @_ in %s with
signatured subroutine is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S
experimental::args_array_with_signatures) An expression that
implicitly involves the @_ arguments array was found in a
subroutine that uses a signature. This is experimental
because the interaction between the arguments array and
parameter handling via signatures is not guaranteed to
remain stable in any future version of Perl, and such code

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Incomplete expression within
&rsquo;(?[ ])&rsquo; in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in <br>
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) There was a syntax error
within the &quot;(?[ ])&quot;. This can happen if the
expression inside the construct was completely empty, or if
there are too many or few operands for the number of
operators. Perl is not smart enough to give you a more
precise indication as to what is wrong.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Inconsistent hierarchy during
C3 merge of class &rsquo;%s&rsquo;: merging failed on <br>
parent &rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The method resolution order
( <small>MRO</small> ) of the given class is not
C3&minus;consistent, and you have enabled the C3
<small>MRO</small> for this class. See the C3 documentation
in mro for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Indentation on line %d of
here-doc doesn&rsquo;t match delimiter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You have an indented
here-document where one or more of its lines have whitespace
at the beginning that does not match the closing
delimiter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
line 2 below is wrong because it does not have at least 2
spaces, but lines 1 and 3 are fine because they have at
least 2:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if ($something)
{ <br>
print &lt;&lt;~EOF; <br>
Line 1 <br>
Line 2 not <br>
Line 3 <br>
EOF <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that tabs
and spaces are compared strictly, meaning 1 tab will not
match 8 spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Infinite recursion in regex</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a pattern that
references itself without consuming any input text. You
should check the pattern to ensure that recursive patterns
either consume text or fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Infinite recursion in
user-defined property</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A user-defined property
(&quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in
perlunicode) can depend on the definitions of other
user-defined properties. If the chain of dependencies leads
back to this property, infinite recursion would occur, were
it not for the check that raised this error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Restructure
your property definitions to avoid this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Infinite recursion via empty
pattern</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use the empty
pattern inside of a regex code block, for instance
&quot;/(?{ s!!! })/&quot;, which resulted in re-executing
the same pattern, which is an infinite loop which is broken
by throwing an exception.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Initialization of state
variables in list currently forbidden</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) &quot;state&quot; only
permits initializing a single variable, specified without
parentheses. So &quot;state $a = 42&quot; and &quot;state @a
= qw(a b c)&quot; are allowed, but not &quot;state ($a) =
42&quot; or &quot;(state $a) = 42&quot;. To initialize more
than one &quot;state&quot; variable, initialize them one at
a time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%%s[%s] in scalar context
better written as $%s[%s]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) In scalar context,
you&rsquo;ve used an array index/value slice (indicated by
%) to select a single element of an array. Generally
it&rsquo;s better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by
$). The difference is that $foo[&amp;bar] always behaves
like a scalar, both in the value it returns and when
evaluating its argument, while %foo[&amp;bar] provides a
list context to its subscript, which can do weird things if
you&rsquo;re expecting only one subscript. When called in
list context, it also returns the index (what &amp;bar
returns) in addition to the value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%%s{%s} in scalar context
better written as $%s{%s}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) In scalar context,
you&rsquo;ve used a hash key/value slice (indicated by %) to
select a single element of a hash. Generally it&rsquo;s
better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $). The
difference is that $foo{&amp;bar} always behaves like a
scalar, both in the value it returns and when evaluating its
argument, while @foo{&amp;bar} and provides a list context
to its subscript, which can do weird things if you&rsquo;re
expecting only one subscript. When called in list context,
it also returns the key in addition to the value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Insecure dependency in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to do something
that the tainting mechanism didn&rsquo;t like. The tainting
mechanism is turned on when you&rsquo;re running setuid or
setgid, or when you specify <b>&minus;T</b> to turn it on
explicitly. The tainting mechanism labels all data
that&rsquo;s derived directly or indirectly from the user,
who is considered to be unworthy of your trust. If any such
data is used in a &quot;dangerous&quot; operation, you get
this error. See perlsec for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Insecure directory in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t use
<b>system()</b>, <b>exec()</b>, or a piped open in a setuid
or setgid script if $ENV{PATH} contains a directory that is
writable by the world. Also, the <small>PATH</small> must
not contain any relative directory. See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Insecure $ENV{%s} while running
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t use
<b>system()</b>, <b>exec()</b>, or a piped open in a setuid
or setgid script if any of $ENV{PATH}, $ENV{IFS},
$ENV{CDPATH}, $ENV{ENV}, $ENV{BASH_ENV} or $ENV{TERM} are
derived from data supplied (or potentially supplied) by the
user. The script must set the path to a known value, using
trustworthy data. See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Insecure user-defined property
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl detected tainted data
when trying to compile a regular expression that contains a
call to a user-defined character property function, i.e.
&quot;\p{IsFoo}&quot; or &quot;\p{InFoo}&quot;. See
&quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode
and perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Integer overflow in format
string for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The indexes and widths
specified in the format string of &quot;printf()&quot; or
&quot;sprintf()&quot; are too large. The numbers must not
overflow the size of integers for your architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Integer overflow in %s
number</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S overflow) The hexadecimal,
octal or binary number you have specified either as a
literal or as an argument to <b>hex()</b> or <b>oct()</b> is
too big for your architecture, and has been converted to a
floating point number. On a 32&minus;bit architecture the
largest hexadecimal, octal or binary number representable
without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively. Note that
Perl transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point
representation internally--subject to loss of precision
errors in subsequent operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Integer overflow in srand</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S overflow) The number you
have passed to srand is too big to fit in your
architecture&rsquo;s integer representation. The number has
been replaced with the largest integer supported (0xFFFFFFFF
on 32&minus;bit architectures). This means you may be
getting less randomness than you expect, because different
random seeds above the maximum will return the same sequence
of random numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Integer overflow in version
<br>
Integer overflow in version %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) Some portion of a
version initialization is too large for the size of integers
for your architecture. This is not a warning because there
is no rational reason for a version to try and use an
element larger than typically 2**32. This is usually caused
by trying to use some odd mathematical operation as a
version, like 100/9.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Internal disaster in regex;
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Something went badly wrong
in the regular expression parser. The
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> shows
whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was
discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Internal inconsistency in
tracking vforks</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl keeps track of the number of times
you&rsquo;ve called &quot;fork&quot; and &quot;exec&quot;,
to determine whether the current call to &quot;exec&quot;
should affect the current script or a subprocess (see
&quot;exec <small>LIST&quot;</small> in perlvms). Somehow,
this count has become scrambled, so Perl is making a guess
and treating this &quot;exec&quot; as a request to terminate
the Perl script and execute the specified command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">internal %&lt;num&gt;p might
conflict with future printf extensions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) Perl&rsquo;s
internal routine that handles &quot;printf&quot; and
&quot;sprintf&quot; formatting follows a slightly different
set of rules when called from C or <small>XS</small> code.
Specifically, formats consisting of digits followed by
&quot;p&quot; (e.g., &quot;%7p&quot;) are reserved for
future use. If you see this message, then an
<small>XS</small> module tried to call that routine with one
such reserved format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Internal urp in regex; marked

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Something went badly awry
in the regular expression parser. The
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> shows
whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was
discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s (...) interpreted as
function</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve run
afoul of the rule that says that any list operator followed
by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list
operators arguments found inside the parentheses. See
&quot;Terms and List Operators (Leftward)&quot; in
perlop.</p>

regex; marked by <br>
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The two-character sequence
&quot;(?&quot; in this context in a regular expression
pattern should be an indivisible token, with nothing
intervening between the &quot;(&quot; and the &quot;?&quot;,

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to create a
custom alias for a character name, with the
&quot;:alias&quot; option to &quot;use charnames&quot; and
the specified character in the indicated name isn&rsquo;t
valid. See &quot; <small>CUSTOM ALIASES&quot;</small> in
charnames.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid \0 character in %s for
%s: %s\0%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syscalls) Embedded \0

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp)(F) The numeric
escape (for example &quot;\xHH&quot;) of value &lt; 256
didn&rsquo;t correspond to a single character through the
conversion from the encoding specified by the encoding
pragma. The escape was replaced with <small>REPLACEMENT

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The character constant
represented by &quot;...&quot; is not a valid hexadecimal

other than 0 &minus; 9 or A &minus; F, a &minus; f in a
hexadecimal number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid module name %s with

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The module argument to
perl&rsquo;s <b>&minus;m</b> and <b>&minus;M</b>
command-line options cannot contain single colons in the
module name, but only in the arguments after &quot;=&quot;.
In other words, <b>&minus;MFoo::Bar=:baz</b> is ok, but
<b>&minus;MFoo:Bar=baz</b> is not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid mro name:

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to
&quot;mro::set_mro(&quot;classname&quot;,
&quot;foo&quot;)&quot; or &quot;use mro 'foo'&quot;, where
&quot;foo&quot; is not a valid method resolution order (
<small>MRO</small> ). Currently, the only valid ones
supported are &quot;dfs&quot; and &quot;c3&quot;, unless you
have loaded a module that is a <small>MRO</small> plugin.
See mro and perlmroapi.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid negative number (%s) in
chr</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W utf8) You passed a negative
number to &quot;chr&quot;. Negative numbers are not valid

character (U+FFFD).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid number &rsquo;%s&rsquo;

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid quantifier in {,} in
regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The pattern looks like a
{min,max} quantifier, but the min or max could not be parsed
as a valid number &minus; either it has leading zeroes, or
it represents too big a number to cope with. The
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> shows where in
the regular expression the problem was discovered. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid [] range &quot;%s&quot;
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The range specified in a
character class had a minimum character greater than the
maximum character. One possibility is that you forgot the
&quot;{}&quot; from your ending &quot;\x{}&quot; &minus;
&quot;\x&quot; without the curly braces can go only up to
&quot;ff&quot;. The &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;

this machine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid separator character %s
in attribute list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Something other than a
colon or whitespace was seen between the elements of an
attribute list. If the previous attribute had a
parenthesised parameter list, perhaps that list was
terminated too soon. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid separator character %s
in PerlIO layer specification %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W layer) When pushing layers
onto the Perl I/O system, something other than a colon or
whitespace was seen between the elements of a layer list. If
the previous attribute had a parenthesised parameter list,
perhaps that list was terminated too soon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid strict version format
(%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A version number did not
meet the &quot;strict&quot; criteria for versions. A
&quot;strict&quot; version number is a positive decimal
number (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation
or else a dotted-decimal v&minus;string with a leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; character and at least three components. The
parenthesized text indicates which criteria were not met.
See the version module for more details on allowed version
formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid type &rsquo;%s&rsquo;

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The given character is not
a valid pack or unpack type. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(W) The given
character is not a valid pack or unpack type but used to be
silently ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid version format (%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A version number did not
meet the &quot;lax&quot; criteria for versions. A
&quot;lax&quot; version number is a positive decimal number
(integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else
a dotted-decimal v&minus;string. If the v&minus;string has
fewer than three components, it must have a leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; character. Otherwise, the leading
&rsquo;v&rsquo; is optional. Both decimal and dotted-decimal
versions may have a trailing &quot;alpha&quot; component
separated by an underscore character after a fractional or
dotted-decimal component. The parenthesized text indicates
which criteria were not met. See the version module for more
details on allowed version formats.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Invalid version object</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The internal structure of
the version object was invalid. Perhaps the internals were
modified directly in some way or an arbitrary reference was

any real use.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(F) The
two-character sequence &quot;(*&quot; in this context in a

indicating that the script is intended to edit files in

since editing <small>STDIN</small> in place doesn&rsquo;t
make sense, and can be confusing because it can make perl
look like it is hanging when it is really just trying to

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Locale &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
contains (at least) the following characters which have <br>
unexpected meanings: %s The Perl program will use the
expected <br>
meanings</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W locale) You are using the
named <small>UTF&minus;8</small> locale.
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> locales are expected to have very
particular behavior, which most do. This message arises when
perl found some departures from the expectations, and is
notifying you that the expected behavior overrides these
differences. In some cases the differences are caused by the
locale definition being defective, but the most common
causes of this warning are when there are ambiguities and
conflicts in following the Standard, and the locale has
chosen an approach that differs from Perl&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One of these is
because that, contrary to the claims, Unicode is not
completely locale insensitive. Turkish and some related
languages have two types of &quot;I&quot; characters. One is
dotted in both upper&minus; and lowercase, and the other is
dotless in both cases. Unicode allows a locale to use either
the Turkish rules, or the rules used in all other instances,
where there is only one type of &quot;I&quot;, which is
dotless in the uppercase, and dotted in the lower. The perl
core does not (yet) handle the Turkish case, and this
message warns you of that. Instead, the Unicode::Casing
module allows you to mostly implement the Turkish casing
rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The other
common cause is for the characters</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ + &lt; = &gt;
^ ` | ~</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These are
problematic. The C standard says that these should be
considered punctuation in the C locale (and the
<small>POSIX</small> standard defers to the C standard), and
Unicode is generally considered a superset of the C locale.
But Unicode has added an extra category, &quot;Symbol&quot;,
and classifies these particular characters as being symbols.
Most <small>UTF&minus;8</small> locales have them treated as
punctuation, so that <b>ispunct</b>(2) returns non-zero for
them. But a few locales have it return 0. Perl takes the
first approach, not using &quot;ispunct()&quot; at all (see
Note [5] in perlrecharclass), and this message is raised to
notify you that you are getting Perl&rsquo;s approach, not
the locale&rsquo;s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Locale &rsquo;%s&rsquo; may not
work well.%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W locale) You are using the
named locale, which is a non&minus;UTF&minus;8 one, and
which perl has determined is not fully compatible with what
it can handle. The second %s gives a reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By far the most
common reason is that the locale has characters in it that
are represented by more than one byte. The only such locales
that Perl can handle are the <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
locales. Most likely the specified locale is a
non&minus;UTF&minus;8 one for an East Asian language such as
Chinese or Japanese. If the locale is a superset of
<small>ASCII,</small> the <small>ASCII</small> portion of it
may work in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Some
essentially obsolete locales that aren&rsquo;t supersets of
<small>ASCII,</small> mainly those in <small>ISO 646</small>
or other 7&minus;bit locales, such as <small>ASMO
449,</small> can also have problems, depending on what
portions of the <small>ASCII</small> character set get
changed by the locale and are also used by the program. The
warning message lists the determinable conflicting
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that not
all incompatibilities are found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If this happens
to you, there&rsquo;s not much you can do except switch to
use a different locale or use Encode to translate from the
locale into <small>UTF&minus;8</small> ; if that&rsquo;s
impracticable, you have been warned that some things may
break.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This message is
output once each time a bad locale is switched into within
the scope of &quot;use&nbsp;locale&quot;, or on the first

<p style="margin-left:11%;">localtime(%f) too large</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called
&quot;localtime&quot; with a number that was larger than it

NaN (the special not-a-number value).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">localtime(%f) too small</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W imprecision) You attempted
to increment or decrement a value by one, but the result is
too large for the underlying floating point representation
to store accurately. Hence, the target of &quot;++&quot; or
&quot;&minus;&minus;&quot; is increased or decreased by
quite different value than one, such as zero (<i>i.e.</i>
the target is unchanged) or two, due to rounding. Perl
issues this warning because it has already switched from
integers to floating point when values are too large for
integers, and now even floating point is insufficient. You
may wish to switch to using Math::BigInt explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>lstat()</b> on

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) Although attributes.pm
allows this, turning the lvalue attribute on or off on a
Perl subroutine that is already defined does not always work
properly. It may or may not do what you want, depending on
what code is inside the subroutine, with exact details
subject to change between Perl versions. Only do this if you
really know what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">lvalue attribute ignored after

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) Using the
&quot;:lvalue&quot; declarative syntax to make a Perl

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed prototype for %s:
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use a function
with a malformed prototype. The syntax of function
prototypes is given a brief compile-time check for obvious
errors like invalid characters. A more rigorous check is run
when the function is called. Perhaps the function&rsquo;s
author was trying to write a subroutine signature but
didn&rsquo;t enable that feature first (&quot;use feature
'signatures'&quot;), so the signature was instead
interpreted as a bad prototype.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Malformed

didn&rsquo;t comply with <small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoding
rules, or represents a code point whose ordinal integer
value doesn&rsquo;t fit into the word size of the current
platform (overflows). Details as to the exact malformation
are given in the variable, %s, part of the message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One possible
cause is that you set the <small>UTF8</small> flag yourself
for data that you thought to be in
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> but it wasn&rsquo;t (it was for
example legacy 8&minus;bit data). To guard against this, you
can use &quot;Encode::decode('UTF&minus;8', ...)&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you use the
&quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)&quot; PerlIO layer for input,
invalid byte sequences are handled gracefully, but if you

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Mandatory parameter follows
optional parameter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) In a subroutine signature,
you wrote something like &quot;$a = undef, $b&quot;, making
an earlier parameter optional and a later one mandatory.
Parameters are filled from left to right, so it&rsquo;s
impossible for the caller to omit an earlier one and pass a
later one. If you want to act as if the parameters are
filled from right to left, declare the rightmost optional
and then shuffle the parameters around in the
subroutine&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Matched non-Unicode code point
0x%X against Unicode property; may not <br>
be portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S non_unicode) Perl allows
strings to contain a superset of Unicode code points; each
code point may be as large as what is storable in a signed
integer on your system, but these may not be accepted by
other languages/systems. This message occurs when you
matched a string containing such a code point against a
regular expression pattern, and the code point was matched
against a Unicode property, &quot;\p{...}&quot; or
&quot;\P{...}&quot;. Unicode properties are only defined on
Unicode code points, so the result of this match is
undefined by Unicode, but Perl (starting in v5.20) treats
non-Unicode code points as if they were typical unassigned
Unicode ones, and matched this one accordingly. Whether a
given property matches these code points or not is specified
in &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot;
in perluniprops.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This message is
suppressed (unless it has been made fatal) if it is
immaterial to the results of the match if the code point is
Unicode or not. For example, the property
&quot;\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}&quot; only can match the 22
characters &quot;[0&minus;9A&minus;Fa&minus;f]&quot;, so
obviously all other code points, Unicode or not, won&rsquo;t
match it. (And &quot;\P{ASCII_Hex_Digit}&quot; will match
every code point except these 22.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Getting this
message indicates that the outcome of the match arguably
should have been the opposite of what actually happened. If
you think that is the case, you may wish to make the
&quot;non_unicode&quot; warnings category fatal; if you
agree with Perl&rsquo;s decision, you may wish to turn off
this category.</p>

perlfunc function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing argument to
&minus;%c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to the
indicated command line switch must follow immediately after
the switch, without intervening spaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing braces on \N{} <br>
Missing braces on \N{} in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Wrong syntax of character
name literal &quot;\N{charname}&quot; within double-quotish
context. This can also happen when there is a space (or
comment) between the &quot;\N&quot; and the &quot;{&quot; in
a regex with the &quot;/x&quot; modifier. This modifier does
not change the requirement that the brace immediately follow
the &quot;\N&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing braces on \o{}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A &quot;\o&quot; must be
followed immediately by a &quot;{&quot; in double-quotish
context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing comma after first
argument to %s function</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) While certain functions
allow you to specify a filehandle or an &quot;indirect
object&quot; before the argument list, this ain&rsquo;t one
of them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing command in piped
open</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W pipe) You used the
&quot;open(FH, &quot;| command&quot;)&quot; or
&quot;open(FH, &quot;command |&quot;)&quot; construction,
but the command was missing or blank.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing control char name in
\c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A double-quoted string
ended with &quot;\c&quot;, without the required control
character name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing &rsquo;]&rsquo; in
prototype for %s : %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W illegalproto) A grouping was
started with &quot;[&quot; but never closed with
&quot;]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing name in &quot;%s
sub&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The syntax for lexically
scoped subroutines requires that they have a name with which
they can be found.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing $ on loop variable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Apparently you&rsquo;ve
been programming in <b>csh</b> too much. Variables are
always mentioned with the $ in Perl, unlike in the shells,
where it can vary from one line to the next.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Missing operator before
%s?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) This is an educated
guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s found
where operator expected&quot;. Often the missing operator is
a comma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing or undefined argument
to %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to call require
or do with no argument or with an undefined value as an
argument. Require expects either a package name or a
file-specification as an argument; do expects a filename.
See &quot;require <small>EXPR&quot;</small> in perlfunc and
&quot;do <small>EXPR&quot;</small> in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing right brace on \%c{} in
regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Missing right brace in
&quot;\x{...}&quot;, &quot;\p{...}&quot;,
&quot;\P{...}&quot;, or &quot;\N{...}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing right brace on \N{}
<br>
Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after
\N</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) &quot;\N&quot; has two
meanings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The traditional
one has it followed by a name enclosed in braces, meaning
the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
name. Thus &quot;\N{ASTERISK}&quot; is another way of
writing &quot;*&quot;, valid in both double-quoted strings
and regular expression patterns. In patterns, it
doesn&rsquo;t have the meaning an unescaped &quot;*&quot;
does.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Starting in
Perl 5.12.0, &quot;\N&quot; also can have an additional
meaning (only) in patterns, namely to match a non-newline
character. (This is short for &quot;[^\n]&quot;, and like
&quot;.&quot; but is not affected by the &quot;/s&quot;
regex modifier.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This can lead
to some ambiguities. When &quot;\N&quot; is not followed
immediately by a left brace, Perl assumes the
&quot;[^\n]&quot; meaning. Also, if the braces form a valid
quantifier such as &quot;\N{3}&quot; or &quot;\N{5,}&quot;,
Perl assumes that this means to match the given quantity of
non-newlines (in these examples, 3; and 5 or more,
respectively). In all other case, where there is a
&quot;\N{&quot; and a matching &quot;}&quot;, Perl assumes
that a character name is desired.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, if
there is no matching &quot;}&quot;, Perl doesn&rsquo;t know
if it was mistakenly omitted, or if &quot;[^\n]{&quot; was
desired, and raises this error. If you meant the former, add
the right brace; if you meant the latter, escape the brace
with a backslash, like so: &quot;\N\{&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Missing right curly or square
bracket</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer counted more
opening curly or square brackets than closing ones. As a
general rule, you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s missing near the
place you were last editing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(Missing semicolon on previous
line?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S syntax) This is an educated
guess made in conjunction with the message &quot;%s found
where operator expected&quot;. Don&rsquo;t automatically put
a semicolon on the previous line just because you saw this
message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Modification of a read-only
value attempted</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried, directly or
indirectly, to change the value of a constant. You
didn&rsquo;t, of course, try &quot;2 = 1&quot;, because the
compiler catches that. But an easy way to do the same thing
is:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub mod { $_[0]
= 1 } <br>
mod(2);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another way is
to assign to a <b>substr()</b> that&rsquo;s off the end of
the string.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Yet another way
is to assign to a &quot;foreach&quot; loop
<i><small>VAR</small></i> when <i><small>VAR</small></i> is
aliased to a constant in the look <i><small>LIST</small></i>
:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$x = 1; <br>
foreach my $n ($x, 2) { <br>
$n *= 2; # modifies the $x, but fails on attempt to <br>
} # modify the 2</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">PerlIO::scalar
will also produce this message as a warning if you attempt
to open a read-only scalar for writing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Modification of non-creatable
array value attempted, %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to make an array
value spring into existence, and the subscript was probably
negative, even counting from end of the array backwards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Modification of non-creatable
hash value attempted, %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) You tried to make a hash
value spring into existence, and it couldn&rsquo;t be
created for some peculiar reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Module name must be
constant</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Only a bare module name is
allowed as the first argument to a &quot;use&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Module name required with
&minus;%c option</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;&minus;M&quot; or
&quot;&minus;m&quot; options say that Perl should load some
module, but you omitted the name of the module. Consult
perlrun for full details about &quot;&minus;M&quot; and
&quot;&minus;m&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">More than one argument to
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; open</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;open&quot;
function has been asked to open multiple files. This can
happen if you are trying to open a pipe to a command that
takes a list of arguments, but have forgotten to specify a
piped open mode. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mprotect for <small>COW</small>
string %p %u failed with %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) You compiled perl with
<b>&minus;D</b> <small>PERL_DEBUG_READONLY_COW</small> (see
&quot;Copy on Write&quot; in perlguts), but a shared string
buffer could not be made read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mprotect for %p %u failed with
%d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) You compiled perl with
<b>&minus;D</b> <small>PERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS</small> (see
perlhacktips), but an op tree could not be made
read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mprotect <small>RW</small> for
<small>COW</small> string %p %u failed with %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) You compiled perl with
<b>&minus;D</b> <small>PERL_DEBUG_READONLY_COW</small> (see
&quot;Copy on Write&quot; in perlguts), but a read-only
shared string buffer could not be made mutable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">mprotect <small>RW</small> for
%p %u failed with %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) You compiled perl with
<b>&minus;D</b> <small>PERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS</small> (see
perlhacktips), but a read-only op tree could not be made
mutable before freeing the ops.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">msg%s not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You don&rsquo;t have System
V message <small>IPC</small> on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Multidimensional hash lookup is
disabled</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You supplied a list of
subscripts to a hash lookup under &quot;no feature
&quot;multidimensional&quot;;&quot;, eg:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$z = $foo{$x,
$y};</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">which by
default acts like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$z =
$foo{join($;, $x, $y)};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Multidimensional syntax %s not
supported</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) Multidimensional
arrays aren&rsquo;t written like $foo[1,2,3]. They&rsquo;re
written like $foo[1][2][3], as in C.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Multiple slurpy parameters not
allowed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) In subroutine signatures, a
slurpy parameter (&quot;@&quot; or &quot;%&quot;) must be
the last parameter, and there must not be more than one of
them; for example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub foo ($a,
@b) {} # legal <br>
sub foo ($a, @b, %) {} # invalid</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;/&rsquo; must follow a
numeric type in unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had an unpack template
that contained a &rsquo;/&rsquo;, but this did not follow
some unpack specification producing a numeric value. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s must not be a named sequence
in transliteration operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Transliteration
(&quot;tr///&quot; and &quot;y///&quot;) transliterates
individual characters. But a named sequence by definition is
more than an individual character, and hence doing this
operation on it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;my sub&quot; not yet
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexically scoped
subroutines are not yet implemented. Don&rsquo;t try that
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;my&quot; subroutine %s
can&rsquo;t be in a package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexically scoped
subroutines aren&rsquo;t in a package, so it doesn&rsquo;t
make sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on
the front.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;my %s&quot; used in sort
comparison</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) The package
variables $a and $b are used for sort comparisons. You used
$a or $b in as an operand to the &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot; or
&quot;cmp&quot; operator inside a sort comparison block, and
the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical
variable. Either qualify the sort variable with the package
name, or rename the lexical variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;my&quot; variable %s
can&rsquo;t be in a package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexically scoped variables
aren&rsquo;t in a package, so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to
try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.
Use <b>local()</b> if you want to localize a package
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Name &quot;%s::%s&quot; used
only once: possible typo</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W once) Typographical errors
often show up as unique variable names. If you had a good
reason for having a unique name, then just mention it again
somehow to suppress the message. The &quot;our&quot;
declaration is also provided for this purpose.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NOTE:</small>
This warning detects package symbols that have been used
only once. This means lexical variables will never trigger
this warning. It also means that all of the package
variables $c, @c, %c, as well as *c, &amp;c, sub c{}, c(),
and c (the filehandle or format) are considered the same; if
a program uses $c only once but also uses any of the others
it will not trigger this warning. Symbols beginning with an
underscore and symbols using special identifiers (q.v.
perldata) are exempt from this warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Need exactly 3 octal digits in
regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Within
&quot;(?[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;])&quot;, all constants
interpreted as octal need to be exactly 3 digits long. This
helps catch some ambiguities. If your constant is too short,
add leading zeros, like</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(?[ [ \078 ] ])
# Syntax error! <br>
(?[ [ \0078 ] ]) # Works <br>
(?[ [ \007 8 ] ]) # Clearer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The maximum
number this construct can express is &quot;\777&quot;. If
you need a larger one, you need to use \o{} instead. If you
meant two separate things, you need to separate them:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(?[ [ \7776 ]
]) # Syntax error! <br>
(?[ [ \o{7776} ] ]) # One meaning <br>
(?[ [ \777 6 ] ]) # Another meaning <br>
(?[ [ \777 \006 ] ]) # Still another</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Negative &rsquo;/&rsquo; count
in unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The length count obtained
from a length/code unpack operation was negative. See
&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Negative length</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to do a
read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer length that is
less than 0. This is difficult to imagine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Negative offset to vec in
lvalue context</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When &quot;vec&quot; is
called in an lvalue context, the second argument must be
greater than or equal to zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Negative repeat count does
nothing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W numeric) You tried to
execute the &quot;x&quot; repetition operator fewer than 0
times, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Nested quantifiers in regex;
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t quantify a
quantifier without intervening parentheses. So things like
** or +* or ?* are illegal. The &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> shows whereabouts in the regular
expression the problem was discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
minimal matching quantifiers, &quot;*?&quot;,
&quot;+?&quot;, and &quot;??&quot; appear to be nested
quantifiers, but aren&rsquo;t. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s never introduced</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) The symbol in
question was declared but somehow went out of scope before
it could possibly have been used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">next::method/next::can/maybe::next::method
cannot find enclosing method</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) &quot;next::method&quot;
needs to be called within the context of a real method in a
real package, and it could not find such a context. See
mro.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">\N in a character class must be
a named character: \N{...} in regex; <br>
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The new (as of Perl 5.12)
meaning of &quot;\N&quot; as &quot;[^\n]&quot; is not valid
in a bracketed character class, for the same reason that
&quot;.&quot; in a character class loses its specialness: it
matches almost everything, which is probably not what you
want.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">\N{} here is restricted to one
character in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;
<small>HERE</small> <br>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Named Unicode character
escapes (&quot;\N{...}&quot;) may return a multi-character
sequence. Even though a character class is supposed to match
just one character of input, perl will match the whole thing
correctly, except under certain conditions. These currently
are <br>
When the class is inverted (&quot;[^...]&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The mathematically logical
behavior for what matches when inverting is very different
from what people expect, so we have decided to forbid
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The escape is the beginning or
final end point of a range</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Similarly unclear is what
should be generated when the &quot;\N{...}&quot; is used as
one of the end points of the range, such as in</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">[\x{41}&minus;\N{ARABIC
SEQUENCE YEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE WITH AE}]</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">What is meant
here is unclear, as the &quot;\N{...}&quot; escape is a
sequence of code points, so this is made an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In a regex set</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The syntax
&quot;(?[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;])&quot; in a regular expression
yields a list of single code points, none can be a
sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No %s allowed while running
setuid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Certain operations are
deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or setgid script to
even be allowed to attempt. Generally speaking there will be
another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at
least securable. See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No code specified for
&minus;%c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl&rsquo;s
<b>&minus;e</b> and <b>&minus;E</b> command-line options
require an argument. If you want to run an empty program,
pass the empty string as a separate argument or run a
program consisting of a single 0 or 1:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl &minus;e

perl &minus;e0 <br>
perl &minus;e1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No comma allowed after %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A list operator that has a
filehandle or &quot;indirect object&quot; is not allowed to
have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it&rsquo;d be just another one of the
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One possible
cause for this is that you expected to have imported a
constant to your name space with <b>use</b> or <b>import</b>
while no such importing took place, it may for example be
that your operating system does not support that particular
constant. Hopefully you did use an explicit import list for
the constants you expect to see; please see &quot;use&quot;
in perlfunc and &quot;import&quot; in perlfunc. While an
explicit import list would probably have caught this error
earlier it naturally does not remedy the fact that your
operating system still does not support that constant. Maybe
you have a typo in the constants of the symbol import list
of <b>use</b> or <b>import</b> or in the constant name at
the line where this error was triggered?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No command into which to pipe
on command line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl handles its own command line
redirection, and found a &rsquo;|&rsquo; at the end of the
command line, so it doesn&rsquo;t know where you want to
pipe the output from this command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No <small>DB::DB</small>
routine defined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The currently executing
code was compiled with the <b>&minus;d</b> switch, but for
some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or
a &quot;Devel::&quot; module) didn&rsquo;t define a routine
to be called at the beginning of each statement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No dbm on this machine</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) This is counted as an
internal error, because every machine should supply dbm
nowadays, because Perl comes with <small>SDBM.</small> See
SDBM_File.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No DB::sub routine defined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The currently executing
code was compiled with the <b>&minus;d</b> switch, but for
some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or
a &quot;Devel::&quot; module) didn&rsquo;t define a

each ordinary subroutine call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No digits found for %s

found following &quot;0b&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No directory specified for
&minus;I</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The <b>&minus;I</b>
command-line switch requires a directory name as part of the

that isn&rsquo;t octal. The resulting value is as
indicated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When not using
&quot;\o{...}&quot;, you wrote something like
&quot;\08&quot;, or &quot;\179&quot; in a double-quotish
string. The resolution is as indicated, with all but the
last digit treated as a single character, specified in
octal. The last digit is the next character in the string.
To tell Perl that this is indeed what you want, you can use
the &quot;\o{ }&quot; syntax, or use exactly three digits to
specify the octal for the character.</p>

subroutine %s in &quot;our&quot; <br>
No package name allowed for variable %s in
&quot;our&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Fully qualified subroutine
and variable names are not allowed in &quot;our&quot;
declarations, because that doesn&rsquo;t make much sense
under existing rules. Such syntax is reserved for future
extensions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No Perl script found in
input</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called &quot;perl
&minus;x&quot;, but no line was found in the file beginning
with #! and containing the word &quot;perl&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No setregid available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Configure didn&rsquo;t find
anything resembling the <b>setreuid()</b> call for your
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such class %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You provided a class
qualifier in a &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or
&quot;state&quot; declaration, but this class doesn&rsquo;t
exist at this point in your program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such class field
&quot;%s&quot; in variable %s of type %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to access a key
from a hash through the indicated typed variable but that
key is not allowed by the package of the same type. The
indicated package has restricted the set of allowed keys
using the fields pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such hook: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified a signal hook
that was not recognized by Perl. Currently, Perl accepts
&quot;__DIE__&quot; and &quot;__WARN__&quot; as valid signal
hooks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such pipe open</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> The internal routine <b>my_pclose()</b>
tried to close a pipe which hadn&rsquo;t been opened. This
should have been caught earlier as an attempt to close an
unopened filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such signal: SIG%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W signal) You specified a
signal name as a subscript to %SIG that was not recognized.
Say &quot;kill &minus;l&quot; in your shell to see the valid
signal names on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No Unicode property value
wildcard matches:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You specified a
wildcard for a Unicode property value, but there is no
property value in the current Unicode release that matches
it. Check your spelling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a <small>CODE</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a code value (that is, a subroutine), but
found a reference to something else instead. You can use the
<b>ref()</b> function to find out what kind of ref it really
was. See also perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a <small>GLOB</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a &quot;typeglob&quot; (that is, a symbol
table entry that looks like *foo), but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the <b>ref()</b>
function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a <small>HASH</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a hash value, but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the <b>ref()</b>
function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;#&rsquo; not allowed
immediately following a sigil in a subroutine signature</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) In a subroutine signature
definition, a comment following a sigil (&quot;$&quot;,
&quot;@&quot; or &quot;%&quot;), needs to be separated by
whitespace or a comma etc., in particular to avoid confusion
with the $# variable. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># bad <br>
sub f ($# ignore first arg <br>
, $b) {} <br>
# good <br>
sub f ($, # ignore first arg <br>
$b) {}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not an <small>ARRAY</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to an array value, but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the <b>ref()</b>
function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a <small>SCALAR</small>
reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a scalar value, but found a reference to
something else instead. You can use the <b>ref()</b>
function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a subroutine reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was trying to evaluate
a reference to a code value (that is, a subroutine), but
found a reference to something else instead. You can use the
<b>ref()</b> function to find out what kind of ref it really
was. See also perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not a subroutine reference in
overload table</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An attempt was made to
specify an entry in an overloading table that doesn&rsquo;t
somehow point to a valid subroutine. See overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not enough arguments for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The function requires more
arguments than you specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Not enough format arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) A format specified
more picture fields than the next line supplied. See
perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: not found</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through the Bourne shell instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">no <small>UTC</small> offset
information; assuming local time is <small>UTC</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) A warning peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl was unable to find the local
timezone offset, so it&rsquo;s assuming that local system
time is equivalent to <small>UTC.</small> If it&rsquo;s not,
define the logical name
<i><small>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</small></i> to translate
to the number of seconds which need to be added to
<small>UTC</small> to get local time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>NULL OP IN
RUN</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S debugging) Some internal
routine called <b>run()</b> with a null opcode pointer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Null picture in formline</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The first argument to
formline must be a valid format picture specification. It
was found to be empty, which probably means you supplied it
an uninitialized value. See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>NULL</small> regexp
parameter</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The internal pattern
matching routines are out of their gourd.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Number too long</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl limits the
representation of decimal numbers in programs to about 250
characters. You&rsquo;ve exceeded that length. Future
versions of Perl are likely to eliminate this arbitrary
limitation. In the meantime, try using scientific notation
(e.g. &quot;1e6&quot; instead of &quot;1_000_000&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Number with no digits</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl was looking for a
number but found nothing that looked like a number. This
happens, for example with &quot;\o{}&quot;, with no number
between the braces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Numeric format result too
large</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The length of the result of
a numeric format supplied to <b>sprintf()</b> or
<b>printf()</b> would have been too large for the underlying
C function to report. This limit is typically 2GB.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Numeric variables with more
than one digit may not start with &rsquo;0&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The only numeric variable
which is allowed to start with a 0 is $0, and you mentioned
a variable that starts with 0 that has more than one digit.
You probably want to remove the leading 0, or if the intent
was to express a variable name in octal you should convert
to decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Octal number &gt; 037777777777
non-portable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W portable) The octal number
you specified is larger than 2**32&minus;1 (4294967295) and
therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
more on portability concerns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Odd name/value argument for
subroutine &rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A subroutine using a slurpy
hash parameter in its signature received an odd number of
arguments to populate the hash. It requires the arguments to
be paired, with the same number of keys as values. The
caller of the subroutine is presumably at fault.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The message
attempts to include the name of the called subroutine. If
the subroutine has been aliased, the subroutine&rsquo;s
original name will be shown, regardless of what name the
caller used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Odd number of arguments for
overload::constant</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overload) The call to
overload::constant contained an odd number of arguments. The
arguments should come in pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Odd number of elements in
anonymous hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You specified an odd
number of elements to initialize a hash, which is odd,
because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Odd number of elements in hash
assignment</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You specified an odd
number of elements to initialize a hash, which is odd,
because hashes come in key/value pairs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Offset outside string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F)(W layer) You tried to do a
read/write/send/recv/seek operation with an offset pointing
outside the buffer. This is difficult to imagine. The sole
exceptions to this are that zero padding will take place
when going past the end of the string when either
&quot;sysread()&quot;ing a file, or when seeking past the
end of a scalar opened for I/O (in anticipation of future
reads and to imitate the behavior with real files).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Old package separator used in
string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You used the old
package separator, &quot;&rsquo;&quot;, in a variable named
inside a double-quoted string; e.g., &quot;In $name's
house&quot;. This is equivalent to &quot;In $name::s
house&quot;. If you meant the former, put a backslash before
the apostrophe (&quot;In $name\'s house&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s() on unopened %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) An I/O operation
was attempted on a filehandle that was never initialized.
You need to do an <b>open()</b>, a <b>sysopen()</b>, or a
<b>socket()</b> call, or call a constructor from the
FileHandle package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&minus;%s on unopened
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to
invoke a file test operator on a filehandle that isn&rsquo;t
open. Check your control flow. See also &quot;&minus;X&quot;
in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">oops: oopsAV</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) An internal
warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">oops: oopsHV</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) An internal
warning that the grammar is screwed up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operand with no preceding
operator in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in <br>
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You wrote something
like</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(?[ \p{Digit}
\p{Thai} ])</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
operands, but no operator giving how you want to combine
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operation &quot;%s&quot;: no
method found, %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An attempt was made to
perform an overloaded operation for which no handler was
defined. While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms
of other handlers, there is no default handler for any
operation, unless the &quot;fallback&quot; overloading key
is specified to be true. See overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operation &quot;%s&quot;
returns its argument for non-Unicode code point 0x%X</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S non_unicode) You performed
an operation requiring Unicode rules on a code point that is
not in Unicode, so what it should do is not defined. Perl
has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that
case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done
on the code point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you know
what you are doing you can turn off this warning by &quot;no
warnings 'non_unicode';&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operation &quot;%s&quot;
returns its argument for <small>UTF&minus;16</small>
surrogate U+%X</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S surrogate) You performed an
operation requiring Unicode rules on a Unicode surrogate.
Unicode frowns upon the use of surrogates for anything but
storing strings in <small>UTF&minus;16,</small> but rules
are (reluctantly) defined for the surrogates, and they are
to do nothing for this operation. Because the use of
surrogates can be dangerous, Perl warns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that
case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done
on the code point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you know
what you are doing you can turn off this warning by &quot;no
warnings 'surrogate';&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Operator or semicolon missing
before %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S ambiguous) You used a
variable or subroutine call where the parser was expecting
an operator. The parser has assumed you really meant to use
an operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect. For
example, if you say &quot;*foo *foo&quot; it will be
interpreted as if you said &quot;*foo *
&rsquo;foo&rsquo;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Optional parameter lacks
default expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) In a subroutine signature,
you wrote something like &quot;$a =&quot;, making a named
optional parameter without a default value. A nameless
optional parameter is permitted to have no default value,
but a named one must have a specific default. You probably
want &quot;$a = undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;our&quot; variable %s
redeclared</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W shadow) You seem to have
already declared the same global once before in the current
lexical scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory!</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The <b>malloc()</b>
function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
Perl has no option but to exit immediately.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At least in
Unix you may be able to get past this by increasing your
process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use &quot;limit&quot;
and &quot;limit datasize n&quot; (where &quot;n&quot; is the
number of kilobytes) to check the current limits and change
them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use &quot;ulimit &minus;a&quot;
and &quot;ulimit &minus;d n&quot;, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory during %s
extend</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) An attempt was made to
extend an array, a list, or a string beyond the largest
possible memory allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory during
&quot;large&quot; request for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The <b>malloc()</b>
function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
However, the request was judged large enough (compile-time
default is 64K), so a possibility to shut down by trapping
this error is granted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory during request
for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X)(F) The <b>malloc()</b>
function returned 0, indicating there was insufficient
remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the
request.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The request was
judged to be small, so the possibility to trap it depends on
the way perl was compiled. By default it is not trappable.
However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of
$^M as an emergency pool after <b>die()</b>ing with this
message. In this case the error is trappable <i>once</i>,
and the error message will include the line and file where
the failed request happened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory during
ridiculously large request</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t allocate
more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes. This error is
most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program.
e.g., $arr[time] instead of $arr[$time].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory for yacc
stack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The yacc parser wanted to
grow its stack so it could continue parsing, but
<b>realloc()</b> wouldn&rsquo;t give it more memory, virtual
or otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;.&rsquo; outside of

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The argument to a

position to before the start of the packed string being
built.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;@&rsquo; outside of
string in unpack</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had a template that
specified an absolute position outside the string being
unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;@&rsquo; outside of
string with malformed <small>UTF&minus;8</small> in

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had a template that
specified an absolute position outside the string being
unpacked. The string being unpacked was also invalid
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small> See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">overload arg &rsquo;%s&rsquo;
is invalid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overload) The overload
pragma was passed an argument it did not recognize. Did you
mistype an operator?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Overloaded dereference did not
return a reference</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An object with an
overloaded dereference operator was dereferenced, but the
overloaded operation did not return a reference. See
overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Overloaded qr did not return a
<small>REGEXP</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An object with a
&quot;qr&quot; overload was used as part of a match, but the
overloaded operation didn&rsquo;t return a compiled regexp.
See overload.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s package attribute may clash
with future reserved word: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W reserved) A lowercase
attribute name was used that had a package-specific handler.
That name might have a meaning to Perl itself some day, even
though it doesn&rsquo;t yet. Perhaps you should use a
mixed-case attribute name, instead. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">pack/unpack repeat count
overflow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t specify a
repeat count so large that it overflows your signed
integers. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">page overflow</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) A single call to
<b>write()</b> produced more lines than can fit on a page.
See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An internal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: attempt to call %s in

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) One of the file test
operators entered a code branch that calls an
<small>ACL</small> related-function, but that function is
not available on this platform. Earlier checks mean that it
should not be possible to enter this branch on this
platform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: child pseudo-process was

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) A child pseudo-process in
the ithreads implementation on Windows was not scheduled
within the time period allowed and therefore was not able to
initialize properly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">panic: ck_grep, type=%u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Failed an internal

running. Perhaps &quot;use 5.10&quot; was written instead of
&quot;use 5.010&quot; or &quot;use v5.10&quot;. Without the
leading &quot;v&quot;, the number is interpreted as a
decimal, with every three digits after the decimal point
representing a part of the version number. So 5.10 is
equivalent to v5.100.</p>

<small>POSIX</small> class constructs [: :], [= =], and [.
.] go <i>inside</i> character classes, the [] are part of
the construct, for example:
&quot;qr/[012[:alpha:]345]/&quot;. What the regular

intending. For example, &quot;qr/[:alpha:]/&quot; compiles
to a regular bracketed character class consisting of the
four characters &quot;:&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;l&quot;,
&quot;h&quot;, and &quot;p&quot;. To specify the

treated as literal data. (You may have used different
delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible attempt to separate

overflowed 3rd argument</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An <b>ioctl()</b> or
<b>fcntl()</b> returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel
byte at the end of the buffer just in case. This sentinel
byte got clobbered, and Perl assumes that memory is now
corrupted. See &quot;ioctl&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible precedence issue with
control flow operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) There is a possible
problem with the mixing of a control flow operator (e.g.
&quot;return&quot;) and a low-precedence operator like
&quot;or&quot;. Consider:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub { return $a
or $b; }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is parsed
as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub { (return
$a) or $b; }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Which is
effectively just:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub { return
$a; }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Either use
parentheses or the high-precedence variant of the
operator.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note this may
be also triggered for constructs like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub { 1 if die;
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible precedence problem on
bitwise %s operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W precedence) Your program
uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction with a
numeric comparison operator, like this :</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if ($x &amp; $y
== 0) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This expression
is actually equivalent to &quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;,
due to the higher precedence of &quot;==&quot;. This is
probably not what you want. (If you really meant to write
this, disable the warning, or, better, put the parentheses
explicitly and write &quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible unintended
interpolation of $\ in regex</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) You said
something like &quot;m/$\/&quot; in a regex. The regex
&quot;m/foo$\s+bar/m&quot; translates to: match the word
&rsquo;foo&rsquo;, the output record separator (see
&quot;$\&quot; in perlvar) and the letter &rsquo;s&rsquo;
(one time or more) followed by the word
&rsquo;bar&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If this is what
you intended then you can silence the warning by using
&quot;m/${\}/&quot; (for example:
&quot;m/foo${\}s+bar/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If instead you
intended to match the word &rsquo;foo&rsquo; at the end of
the line followed by whitespace and the word
&rsquo;bar&rsquo; on the next line then you can use
&quot;m/$(?)\/&quot; (for example:
&quot;m/foo$(?)\s+bar/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possible unintended
interpolation of %s in string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W ambiguous) You said
something like &rsquo;@foo&rsquo; in a double-quoted string
but there was no array @foo in scope at the time. If you
wanted a literal @foo, then write it as \@foo; otherwise
find out what happened to the array you apparently lost
track of.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Precedence problem: open %s
should be open(%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S precedence) The old
irregular construct</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">open FOO ||
die;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">is now
misinterpreted as</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">open(FOO ||
die);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">because of the
strict regularization of Perl 5&rsquo;s grammar into unary
and list operators. (The old open was a little of both.) You
must put parentheses around the filehandle, or use the new

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You applied a
regular expression quantifier in a place where it makes no
sense, such as on a zero-width assertion. Try putting the
quantifier inside the assertion instead. For example, the
way to match &quot;abc&quot; provided that it is followed by
three repetitions of &quot;xyz&quot; is
&quot;/abc(?=(?:xyz){3})/&quot;, not
&quot;/abc(?=xyz){3}/&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) One (or both) of the

even-sized list expected</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You gave a single
reference where Perl was expecting a list with an even

might use ^# instead. See perlform.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Replacement list is longer than

a single character, specified in octal. The last digit is
the next character in the string. To tell Perl that this is
indeed what you want, you can use the &quot;\o{ }&quot;
syntax, or use exactly three digits to specify the octal for
the character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Reversed %s= operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You wrote your

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Scalars leaked: %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S internal) Something went
wrong in Perl&rsquo;s internal bookkeeping of scalars: not
all scalar variables were deallocated by the time Perl
exited. What this usually indicates is a memory leak, which
is of course bad, especially if the Perl program is intended
to be long-running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Scalar value @%s[%s] better
written as $%s[%s]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve used an
array slice (indicated by @) to select a single element of
an array. Generally it&rsquo;s better to ask for a scalar
value (indicated by $). The difference is that
$foo[&amp;bar] always behaves like a scalar, both when
assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while
@foo[&amp;bar] behaves like a list when you assign to it,
and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do
weird things if you&rsquo;re expecting only one
subscript.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the array element
as a list, you need to look into how references work,
because Perl will not magically convert between scalars and
lists for you. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Scalar value @%s{%s} better

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You&rsquo;ve used a

(indicated by $). The difference is that $foo{&amp;bar}
always behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and

error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that since
Perl 5.10.0 a // can also be the <i>defined-or</i>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">500 Server error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) This is the error message
generally seen in a browser window when trying to run a
<small>CGI</small> program (including <small>SSI</small> )
over the web. The actual error text varies widely from
server to server. The most frequently-seen variants are
&quot;500 Server error&quot;, &quot;Method (something) not
permitted&quot;, &quot;Document contains no data&quot;,
&quot;Premature end of script headers&quot;, and &quot;Did
not produce a valid header&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>This is a

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>setegid()</b> not
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign to $),
and your operating system doesn&rsquo;t support the
<b>setegid()</b> system call (or equivalent), or at least
Configure didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>seteuid()</b> not
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign to
$&gt;, and your operating system doesn&rsquo;t support the
<b>seteuid()</b> system call (or equivalent), or at least
Configure didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">setpgrp can&rsquo;t take
arguments</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your system has the
<b>setpgrp()</b> from <small>BSD 4.2,</small> which takes no
arguments, unlike <small>POSIX</small> <b>setpgid()</b>,
which takes a process <small>ID</small> and process group
<small>ID.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>setrgid()</b> not
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign to $(,
and your operating system doesn&rsquo;t support the
<b>setrgid()</b> system call (or equivalent), or at least
Configure didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>setruid()</b> not
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign to
$&lt;, and your operating system doesn&rsquo;t support the
<b>setruid()</b> system call (or equivalent), or at least
Configure didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>setsockopt()</b> on closed
socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to set a
socket option on a closed socket. Did you forget to check
the return value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See
&quot;setsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Setting $/ to a reference to %s
is forbidden</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You assigned a reference to
a scalar to $/ where the referenced item is not a positive
integer. In older perls this <b>appeared</b> to work the
same as setting it to &quot;undef&quot; but was in fact
internally different, less efficient and with very bad luck
could have resulted in your file being split by a
stringified form of the reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.20.0
this was changed so that it would be <b>exactly</b> the same
as setting $/ to undef, with the exception that this warning
would be thrown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You are
recommended to change your code to set $/ to
&quot;undef&quot; explicitly if you wish to slurp the file.
As of Perl 5.28 assigning $/ to a reference to an integer
which isn&rsquo;t positive is a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Setting $/ to %s reference is
forbidden</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to assign a
reference to a non integer to $/. In older Perls this would
have behaved similarly to setting it to a reference to a
positive integer, where the integer was the address of the
reference. As of Perl 5.20.0 this is a fatal error, to allow
future versions of Perl to use non-integer refs for more
interesting purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">shm%s not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You don&rsquo;t have System
V shared memory <small>IPC</small> on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">!=~ should be !~</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) The non-matching
operator is !~, not !=~. !=~ will be interpreted as the !=
(numeric not equal) and ~ (1&rsquo;s complement) operators:
probably not what you intended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">/%s/ should probably be written
as &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You have used a
pattern where Perl expected to find a string, as in the
first argument to &quot;join&quot;. Perl will treat the true
or false result of matching the pattern against $_ as the
string, which is probably not what you had in mind.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>shutdown()</b> on closed
socket %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to do a
shutdown on a closed socket. Seems a bit superfluous.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">SIG%s handler &quot;%s&quot;
not defined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W signal) The signal handler
named in %SIG doesn&rsquo;t, in fact, exist. Perhaps you put
it into the wrong package?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Slab leaked from cv %p</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) If you see this message,
then something is seriously wrong with the internal
bookkeeping of op trees. An op tree needed to be freed after
a compilation error, but could not be found, so it was
leaked instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sleep(%u) too large</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W overflow) You called
&quot;sleep&quot; with a number that was larger than it can
reliably handle and &quot;sleep&quot; probably slept for
less time than requested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Slurpy parameter not last</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) In a subroutine signature,
you put something after a slurpy (array or hash) parameter.
The slurpy parameter takes all the available arguments, so
there can&rsquo;t be any left to fill later parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Smart matching a non-overloaded
object breaks encapsulation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You should not use the
&quot;~~&quot; operator on an object that does not overload
it: Perl refuses to use the object&rsquo;s underlying
structure for the smart match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Smartmatch is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::smartmatch)
This warning is emitted if you use the smartmatch
(&quot;~~&quot;) operator. This is currently an experimental
feature, and its details are subject to change in future
releases of Perl. Particularly, its current behavior is
noticed for being unnecessarily complex and unintuitive, and
is very likely to be overhauled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Sorry, hash keys must be
smaller than 2**31 bytes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to create a hash
containing a very large key, where &quot;very large&quot;
means that it needs at least 2 gigabytes to store.
Unfortunately, Perl doesn&rsquo;t yet handle such large hash
keys. You should reconsider your design to avoid hashing
such a long string directly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sort is now a reserved word</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An ancient error message
that almost nobody ever runs into anymore. But before sort
was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Source filters apply only to
byte streams</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to activate a
source filter (usually by loading a source filter module)
within a string passed to &quot;eval&quot;. This is not
permitted under the &quot;unicode_eval&quot; feature.
Consider using &quot;evalbytes&quot; instead. See
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>splice()</b> offset past end
of array</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You attempted to
specify an offset that was past the end of the array passed
to <b>splice()</b>. Splicing will instead commence at the
end of the array, rather than past it. If this isn&rsquo;t
what you want, try explicitly pre-extending the array by
assigning $#array = $offset. See &quot;splice&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Split loop</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The split was looping
infinitely. (Obviously, a split shouldn&rsquo;t iterate more
times than there are characters of input, which is what
happened.) See &quot;split&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Statement unlikely to be
reached</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W exec) You did an
<b>exec()</b> with some statement after it other than a
<b>die()</b>. This is almost always an error, because
<b>exec()</b> never returns unless there was a failure. You
probably wanted to use <b>system()</b> instead, which does
return. To suppress this warning, put the <b>exec()</b> in a
block by itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;state&quot; subroutine %s
can&rsquo;t be in a package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexically scoped
subroutines aren&rsquo;t in a package, so it doesn&rsquo;t
make sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on
the front.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;state %s&quot; used in
sort comparison</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) The package
variables $a and $b are used for sort comparisons. You used
$a or $b in as an operand to the &quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot; or
&quot;cmp&quot; operator inside a sort comparison block, and
the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical
variable. Either qualify the sort variable with the package
name, or rename the lexical variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;state&quot; variable %s
can&rsquo;t be in a package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Lexically scoped variables
aren&rsquo;t in a package, so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to
try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.
Use <b>local()</b> if you want to localize a package
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>stat()</b> on unopened
filehandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to use
the <b>stat()</b> function on a filehandle that was either
never opened or has since been closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Strings with code points over
0xFF may not be mapped into in-memory <br>
file handles</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W utf8) You tried to open a
reference to a scalar for read or append where the scalar
contained code points over 0xFF. In-memory files model
on-disk files and can only contain bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Stub found while resolving
method &quot;%s&quot; overloading &quot;%s&quot; in package
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Overloading resolution over
@ISA tree may be broken by importation stubs. Stubs should
never be implicitly created, but explicit calls to
&quot;can&quot; may break this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Subroutine attributes must come
before the signature</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When subroutine signatures
are enabled, any subroutine attributes must come before the
signature. Note that this order was the opposite in versions
5.22..5.26. So:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub foo :lvalue
($a, $b) { ... } # 5.20 and 5.28 + <br>
sub foo ($a, $b) :lvalue { ... } # 5.22 .. 5.26</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Subroutine &quot;&amp;%s&quot;
is not available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closure) During compilation,
an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture
an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently available.
This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the lexical
subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine
that has not yet been created. (Remember that named subs are
created at compile time, while anonymous subs are created at
run-time.) For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub { my sub a
{...} sub f { \&amp;a } }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At the time
that f is created, it can&rsquo;t capture the current
&quot;a&quot; sub, since the anonymous subroutine
hasn&rsquo;t been created yet. Conversely, the following
won&rsquo;t give a warning since the anonymous subroutine
has by now been created and is live:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub { my sub a
{...} eval 'sub f { \&amp;a }' }&minus;&gt;();</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The second
situation is caused by an eval accessing a lexical
subroutine that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub f { <br>
my sub a {...} <br>
sub { eval '\&amp;a' } <br>
} <br>
f()&minus;&gt;();</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here, when the
&rsquo;\&amp;a&rsquo; in the eval is being compiled, f() is
not currently being executed, so its &amp;a is not available
for capture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;%s&quot; subroutine
&amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W shadow) A &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;state&quot; subroutine has been redeclared in the
current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all
access to the previous instance. This is almost always a
typographical error. Note that the earlier subroutine will
still exist until the end of the scope or until all closure
references to it are destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Subroutine %s redefined</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W redefine) You redefined a
subroutine. To suppress this warning, say</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
no warnings 'redefine'; <br>
eval &quot;sub name { ... }&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Subroutine &quot;%s&quot; will
not stay shared</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closure) An inner (nested)
<i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a &quot;my&quot;
subroutine defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the inner
subroutine is called, it will see the value of the outer
subroutine&rsquo;s lexical subroutine as it was before and
during the *first* call to the outer subroutine; in this
case, after the first call to the outer subroutine is
complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no longer
share a common value for the lexical subroutine. In other
words, it will no longer be shared. This will especially
make a difference if the lexical subroutines accesses
lexical variables declared in its surrounding scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the &quot;sub {}&quot; syntax. When inner
anonymous subs that reference lexical subroutines in outer
subroutines are created, they are automatically rebound to
the current values of such lexical subs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Substitution loop</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) The substitution was
looping infinitely. (Obviously, a substitution
shouldn&rsquo;t iterate more times than there are characters
of input, which is what happened.) See the discussion of
substitution in &quot;Regexp Quote-Like Operators&quot; in
perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Substitution pattern not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the interior delimiter of an s/// or s{}{} construct.
Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
Missing the leading &quot;$&quot; from variable $s may cause
this error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Substitution replacement not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the final delimiter of an s/// or s{}{} construct.
Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
Missing the leading &quot;$&quot; from variable $s may cause
this error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">substr outside of string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W substr)(F) You tried to
reference a <b>substr()</b> that pointed outside of a
string. That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger
than the length of the string. See &quot;substr&quot; in
perlfunc. This warning is fatal if substr is used in an
lvalue context (as the left hand side of an assignment or as
a subroutine argument for example).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sv_upgrade from type %d down to
type %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Perl tried to force the
upgrade of an <small>SV</small> to a type which was actually
inferior to its current type.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Switch (?(condition)...
contains too many branches in regex; marked by <br>
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A
(?(condition)if&minus;clause|else&minus;clause) construct
can have at most two branches (the if-clause and the
else-clause). If you want one or both to contain
alternation, such as using &quot;this|that|other&quot;,
enclose it in clustering parentheses:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(?(condition)(?:this|that|other)|else&minus;clause)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> shows

discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Switch condition not recognized
in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The condition part of a
(?(condition)if&minus;clause|else&minus;clause) construct is
not known. The condition must be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(1) (2) ...
true if 1st, 2nd, etc., capture matched <br>
(&lt;NAME&gt;) ('NAME') true if named capture matched <br>

(?!...) (?&lt;!...) true if subpattern fails to match <br>
(?{ CODE }) true if code returns a true value <br>
(R) true if evaluating inside recursion <br>
(R1) (R2) ... true if directly inside capture group 1, 2,
etc. <br>
(R&amp;NAME) true if directly inside named capture <br>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You omitted to close a
(?(condition)...) block somewhere in the pattern. Add a
closing parenthesis in the appropriate position. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">switching effective %s is not
implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) While under the &quot;use
filetest&quot; pragma, we cannot switch the real and
effective uids or gids.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syntax error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Probably means you had a
syntax error. Common reasons include:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A keyword is
misspelled. <br>
A semicolon is missing. <br>
A comma is missing. <br>
An opening or closing parenthesis is missing. <br>
An opening or closing brace is missing. <br>
A closing quote is missing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Often there
will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information. (Sometimes it helps to turn
on <b>&minus;w</b>.) The error message itself often tells
you where it was in the line when it decided to give up.
Sometimes the actual error is several tokens before this,
because Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in
a blue moon the only way to figure out what&rsquo;s
triggering the error is to call &quot;perl &minus;c&quot;
repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away. Sort of the cybernetic version of
20&nbsp;questions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syntax error at line %d:
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; unexpected</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through the Bourne shell instead of Perl.
Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">syntax error in file %s at line
%d, next 2 tokens &quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This error is likely to
occur if you run a perl5 script through a perl4 interpreter,
especially if the next 2 tokens are &quot;use strict&quot;
or &quot;my $var&quot; or &quot;our $var&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Syntax error in (?[...]) in
regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl could not figure out
what you meant inside this construct; this notifies you that
it is giving up trying.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s syntax <small>OK</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The final summary message
when a &quot;perl &minus;c&quot; succeeds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>sysread()</b> on closed

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closed) You tried to read
from a closed filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>sysread()</b> on unopened

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to read
from a filehandle that was never opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">System V %s is not implemented

some machines the functionality can exist but be
unconfigured. Consult your system support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>syswrite()</b> on closed

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;T&quot; and
&quot;&minus;B&quot; not implemented on filehandles</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl can&rsquo;t peek at
the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn&rsquo;t know
about your kind of stdio. You&rsquo;ll have to use a
filename instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Target of goto is too deeply
nested</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use
&quot;goto&quot; to reach a label that was too deeply nested
for Perl to reach. Perl is doing you a favor by
refusing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>telldir()</b> attempted on
invalid dirhandle %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) The dirhandle you tried
to <b>telldir()</b> is either closed or not really a
dirhandle. Check your control flow.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tell()</b> on unopened
filehandle</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W unopened) You tried to use
the <b>tell()</b> function on a filehandle that was either
never opened or has since been closed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The <b>crypt()</b> function is
unimplemented due to excessive paranoia.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Configure couldn&rsquo;t
find the <b>crypt()</b> function on your machine, probably
because your vendor didn&rsquo;t supply it, probably because
they think the U.S. Government thinks it&rsquo;s a secret,
or at least that they will continue to pretend that it is.
And if you quote me on that, I will deny it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The experimental declared_refs
feature is not enabled</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) To declare references to
variables, as in &quot;my \%x&quot;, you must first enable
the feature:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">no warnings
&quot;experimental::declared_refs&quot;; <br>
use feature &quot;declared_refs&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The %s function is
unimplemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The function indicated
isn&rsquo;t implemented on this architecture, according to
the probings of Configure.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The private_use feature is
experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::private_use)
This feature is actually a hook for future use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The stat preceding %s
wasn&rsquo;t an lstat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) It makes no sense to test
the current stat buffer for symbolic linkhood if the last
stat that wrote to the stat buffer already went past the
symlink to get to the real file. Use an actual filename
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The Unicode property wildcards
feature is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S
experimental::uniprop_wildcards) This feature is
experimental and its behavior may in any future release of
perl. See &quot;Wildcards in Property Values&quot; in
perlunicode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">The &rsquo;unique&rsquo;
attribute may only be applied to &rsquo;our&rsquo;
variables</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This attribute was never
supported on &quot;my&quot; or &quot;sub&quot;
declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This Perl can&rsquo;t reset
<small>CRTL</small> environ elements (%s) <br>
This Perl can&rsquo;t set <small>CRTL</small> environ
elements (%s=%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W internal) Warnings peculiar
to <small>VMS.</small> You tried to change or delete an
element of the <small>CRTL</small> &rsquo;s internal environ
array, but your copy of Perl wasn&rsquo;t built with a
<small>CRTL</small> that contained the <b>setenv()</b>
function. You&rsquo;ll need to rebuild Perl with a
<small>CRTL</small> that does, or redefine
<i><small>PERL_ENV_TABLES</small></i> (see perlvms) so that
the environ array isn&rsquo;t the target of the change to
%ENV which produced the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This Perl has not been built
with support for randomized hash key <br>
traversal but something called
<b>Perl_hv_rand_set()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Something has attempted to
use an internal <small>API</small> call which depends on
Perl being compiled with the default support for randomized
hash key traversal, but this Perl has been compiled without
it. You should report this warning to the relevant upstream
party, or recompile perl with default options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This use of <b>my()</b> in
false conditional is no longer allowed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a declaration
similar to &quot;my $x if 0&quot;. There has been a
long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable not
to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a
false conditional. Some people have exploited this bug to
achieve a kind of static variable. Since we intend to fix
this bug, we don&rsquo;t want people relying on this
behavior. You can achieve a similar static effect by
declaring the variable in a separate block outside the
function, eg</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub f { my $x
if 0; return $x++ }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">becomes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">{ my $x; sub f
{ return $x++ } }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Beginning with
perl 5.10.0, you can also use &quot;state&quot; variables to
have lexicals that are initialized only once (see
feature):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub f { state
$x; return $x++ }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This use of
&quot;my()&quot; in a false conditional was deprecated
beginning in Perl 5.10 and became a fatal error in Perl
5.30.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Timeout waiting for another
thread to define \p{%s}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The first time a
user-defined property (&quot;User-Defined Character
Properties&quot; in perlunicode) is used, its definition is
looked up and converted into an internal form for more
efficient handling in subsequent uses. There could be a race
if two or more threads tried to do this processing nearly
simultaneously. Instead, a critical section is created
around this task, locking out all but one thread from doing
it. This message indicates that the thread that is doing the
conversion is taking an unexpectedly long time. The timeout
exists solely to prevent deadlock; it&rsquo;s long enough
that the system was likely thrashing and about to crash.
There is no real remedy but rebooting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">times not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your version of the C
library apparently doesn&rsquo;t do <b>times()</b>. I
suspect you&rsquo;re not running on Unix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;T&quot; is on the
#! line, it must also be used on the command line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The #! line (or local
equivalent) in a Perl script contains the <b>&minus;T</b>
option (or the <b>&minus;t</b> option), but Perl was not
invoked with <b>&minus;T</b> in its command line. This is an
error because, by the time Perl discovers a <b>&minus;T</b>
in a script, it&rsquo;s too late to properly taint
everything from the environment. So Perl gives up.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the Perl
script is being executed as a command using the #! mechanism
(or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed
by editing the #! line so that the <b>&minus;%c</b> option
is a part of Perl&rsquo;s first argument: e.g. change
&quot;perl &minus;n &minus;%c&quot; to &quot;perl &minus;%c
&minus;n&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the Perl
script is being executed as &quot;perl scriptname&quot;,
then the <b>&minus;%c</b> option must appear on the command
line: &quot;perl &minus;%c scriptname&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">To%s: illegal mapping
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to define a
customized To-mapping for <b>lc()</b>, lcfirst, <b>uc()</b>,
or <b>ucfirst()</b> (or their string-inlined versions), but
you specified an illegal mapping. See &quot;User-Defined
Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too deeply nested
()&minus;groups</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your template contains
()&minus;groups with a ridiculously deep nesting level.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too few args to syscall</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) There has to be at least
one argument to <b>syscall()</b> to specify the system call
to call, silly dilly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too few arguments for
subroutine &rsquo;%s&rsquo; (got %d; expected %d)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A subroutine using a
signature fewer arguments than required by the signature.
The caller of the subroutine is presumably at fault.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The message
attempts to include the name of the called subroutine. If
the subroutine has been aliased, the subroutine&rsquo;s
original name will be shown, regardless of what name the
caller used. It will also indicate the number of arguments
given and the number expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too few arguments for
subroutine &rsquo;%s&rsquo; (got %d; expected at least
%d)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Similar to the previous message
but for subroutines that accept a variable number of
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too late for
&quot;&minus;%s&quot; option</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(X) The #! line (or local
equivalent) in a Perl script contains the <b>&minus;M</b>,
<b>&minus;m</b> or <b>&minus;C</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In the case of
<b>&minus;M</b> and <b>&minus;m</b>, this is an error
because those options are not intended for use inside
scripts. Use the &quot;use&quot; pragma instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;C</b> option only works if it is specified on the
command line as well (with the same sequence of letters or
numbers following). Either specify this option on the
command line, or, if your system supports it, make your
script executable and run it directly instead of passing it
to perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too late to run %s block</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W void) A <small>CHECK</small>
or <small>INIT</small> block is being defined during run
time proper, when the opportunity to run them has already
passed. Perhaps you are loading a file with
&quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot; when you should be
using &quot;use&quot; instead. Or perhaps you should put the
&quot;require&quot; or &quot;do&quot; inside a
<small>BEGIN</small> block.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many args to syscall</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl supports a maximum of
only 14 args to <b>syscall()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many arguments for %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The function requires fewer
arguments than you specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many arguments for
subroutine &rsquo;%s&rsquo; (got %d; expected %d)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A subroutine using a
signature received more arguments than permitted by the
signature. The caller of the subroutine is presumably at
fault.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The message
attempts to include the name of the called subroutine. If
the subroutine has been aliased, the subroutine&rsquo;s
original name will be shown, regardless of what name the
caller used. It will also indicate the number of arguments
given and the number expected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many arguments for
subroutine &rsquo;%s&rsquo; (got %d; expected at most
%d)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Similar to the previous message
but for subroutines that accept a variable number of
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many nested open parens in
regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You have exceeded the
number of open &quot;(&quot; parentheses that haven&rsquo;t
been matched by corresponding closing ones. This limit
prevents eating up too much memory. It is initially set to
1000, but may be changed by setting
&quot;${^RE_COMPILE_RECURSION_LIMIT}&quot; to some other
value. This may need to be done in a <small>BEGIN</small>
block before the regular expression pattern is compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many )&rsquo;s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally
run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of Perl. Check
the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
yourself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Too many (&rsquo;s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(A) You&rsquo;ve accidentally

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Trailing \ in regex m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The regular expression ends
with an unbackslashed backslash. Backslash it. See
perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Transliteration pattern not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the interior delimiter of a tr/// or tr[][] or y/// or
y[][] construct. Missing the leading &quot;$&quot; from
variables $tr or $y may cause this error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Transliteration replacement not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer couldn&rsquo;t
find the final delimiter of a tr///, tr[][], y/// or y[][]
construct.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;%s&rsquo; trapped by
operation mask</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to use an
operator from a Safe compartment in which it&rsquo;s
disallowed. See Safe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">truncate not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t
implement a file truncation mechanism that Configure knows
about.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">try/catch is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::try) This
warning is emitted if you use the &quot;try&quot; and

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Type of arg %d to &amp;CORE::%s
must be %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The subroutine in question
in the <small>CORE</small> package requires its argument to
be a hard reference to data of the specified type.
Overloading is ignored, so a reference to an object that is
not the specified type, but nonetheless has overloading to
handle it, will still not be accepted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Type of arg %d to %s must be %s
(not %s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This function requires the
argument in that position to be of a certain type. Arrays
must be @NAME or &quot;@{EXPR}&quot;. Hashes must be %NAME
or &quot;%{EXPR}&quot;. No implicit dereferencing is
allowed--use the { <small>EXPR</small> } forms as an
explicit dereference. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">umask not implemented</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t

found some strings remaining in the shared string table used
for copy on write and for hash keys. The entries should have
been freed, so this indicates a bug somewhere.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unbalanced tmps: %d more allocs

&quot;[}]&quot;). If you meant it as closing a corresponding
&quot;[&quot; or &quot;{&quot;, you&rsquo;ll need to look
back through the pattern to find out why that isn&rsquo;t
happening.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">unexec of %s into %s
failed!</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The <b>unexec()</b> routine
failed for some reason. See your local <small>FSF</small>
representative, who probably put it there in the first
place.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unexpected binary operator
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; with no preceding operand in regex; <br>
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had something like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Within
&quot;(?[ ])&quot;, no literal characters are allowed unless
they are within an inner pair of square brackets, like</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(?[ [ z ]

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another
possibility is that you forgot a backslash. Perl isn&rsquo;t
smart enough to figure out what you really meant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unexpected exit %u</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) <b>exit()</b> was called or
the script otherwise finished gracefully when
&quot;PERL_EXIT_WARN&quot; was set in
&quot;PL_exit_flags&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unexpected exit failure %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) An uncaught <b>die()</b>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You had something like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;)&quot; is out-of-place. Something apparently was
supposed to be combined with the digits, or the
&quot;+&quot; shouldn&rsquo;t be there, or something like
that. Perl can&rsquo;t figure out what was intended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unexpected &rsquo;]&rsquo; with
no following &rsquo;)&rsquo; in (?[... in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small><br>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) While parsing an extended
character class a &rsquo;]&rsquo; character was encountered
at a point in the definition where the only legal use of
&rsquo;]&rsquo; is to close the character class definition
as part of a &rsquo;])&rsquo;, you may have forgotten the
close paren, or otherwise confused the parser.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unexpected &rsquo;(&rsquo; with
no preceding operator in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unicode non-character U+%X is
not recommended for open interchange</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S nonchar) Certain codepoints,
such as U+FFFE and U+FFFF, are defined by the Unicode
standard to be non-characters. Those are legal codepoints,
but are reserved for internal use; so, applications
shouldn&rsquo;t attempt to exchange them. An application may
not be expecting any of these characters at all, and
receiving them may lead to bugs. If you know what you are
doing you can turn off this warning by &quot;no warnings
'nonchar';&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is not
really a &quot;severe&quot; error, but it is supposed to be
raised by default even if warnings are not enabled, and
currently the only way to do that in Perl is to mark it as
serious.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unicode property wildcard not
terminated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A Unicode property wildcard
looks like a delimited regular expression pattern (all
within the braces of the enclosing &quot;\p{...}&quot;. The
closing delimtter to match the opening one was not found. If
the opening one is escaped by preceding it with a backslash,
the closing one must also be so escaped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unicode string properties are
not implemented in (?[...]) in regex; <br>
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A Unicode string property
is one which expands to a sequence of multiple characters.
An example is &quot;\p{name=KATAKANA LETTER AINU P}&quot;,
which is comprised of the sequence &quot;\N{KATAKANA LETTER
SMALL H}&quot; followed by &quot;\N{COMBINING
KATAKANA&minus;HIRAGANA SEMI&minus;VOICED SOUND MARK}&quot;.
Extended character classes, &quot;(?[...])&quot; currently
cannot handle these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unicode surrogate U+%X is
illegal in <small>UTF&minus;8</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S surrogate) You had a
<small>UTF&minus;16</small> surrogate in a context where
they are not considered acceptable. These code points,
between U+D800 and U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode
only for <small>UTF&minus;16.</small> However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to
the size limit available on your platform), including
surrogates. But these can cause problems when being input or
output, which is likely where this message came from. If you
really really know what you are doing you can turn off this
warning by &quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown charname
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The name you used inside
&quot;\N{}&quot; is unknown to Perl. Check the spelling. You
can say &quot;use charnames &quot;:loose&quot;&quot; to not
have to be so precise about spaces, hyphens, and
capitalization on standard Unicode names. (Any custom
aliases that have been created must be specified exactly,
regardless of whether &quot;:loose&quot; is used or not.)
This error may also happen if the &quot;\N{}&quot; is not in
the scope of the corresponding
&quot;use&nbsp;charnames&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown &rsquo;(*...)&rsquo;
construct &rsquo;%s&rsquo; in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;(*&quot; was
followed by something that the regular expression compiler
does not recognize. Check your spelling.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown error</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) Perl was about to print an
error message in $@, but the $@ variable did not exist, even
after an attempt to create it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown locale category %d;
can&rsquo;t set it to %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W locale) You used a locale
category that perl doesn&rsquo;t recognize, so it cannot
carry out your request. Check that you are using a valid
category. If so, see &quot;Multi-threaded&quot; in
perllocale for advice on reporting this as a bug, and for
modifying perl locally to accommodate your needs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown <b>open()</b> mode
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The second argument of
3&minus;argument <b>open()</b> is not among the list of
valid modes: &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;,
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;+&lt;&quot;, &quot;+&gt;&quot;,

&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown PerlIO layer
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W layer) An attempt was made
to push an unknown layer onto the Perl I/O system. (Layers
take care of transforming data between external and internal
representations.) Note that some layers, such as
&quot;mmap&quot;, are not supported in all environments. If
your program didn&rsquo;t explicitly request the failing
operation, it may be the result of the value of the
environment variable <small>PERLIO.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown process %x sent message
to prime_env_iter: %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) An error peculiar to
<small>VMS.</small> Perl was reading values for %ENV before
iterating over it, and someone else stuck a message in the
stream of data Perl expected. Someone&rsquo;s very confused,
or perhaps trying to subvert Perl&rsquo;s population of %ENV
for nefarious purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown regexp modifier
&quot;/%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Alphanumerics immediately
following the closing delimiter of a regular expression
pattern are interpreted by Perl as modifier flags for the
regex. One of the ones you specified is invalid. One way
this can happen is if you didn&rsquo;t put in white space
between the end of the regex and a following alphanumeric
operator:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if ($a =~
/foo/and $bar == 3) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;a&quot; is a valid modifier flag, but the
&quot;n&quot; is not, and raises this error. Likely what was
meant instead was:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if ($a =~ /foo/
and $bar == 3) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown &quot;re&quot;
subpragma &rsquo;%s&rsquo; (known ones are: %s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You tried to use an unknown
subpragma of the &quot;re&quot; pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown switch condition
(?(...)) in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The condition part of a
(?(condition)if&minus;clause|else&minus;clause) construct is
not known. The condition must be one of the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(1) (2) ...

(*nla:...) (*nlb:...) true if subpattern fails to match;
also <br>
(*negative_lookahead:...) <br>
(*negative_lookbehind:...) <br>
(?{ CODE }) true if code returns a true value <br>
(R) true if evaluating inside recursion <br>
(R1) (R2) ... true if directly inside capture group 1, 2,
<br>
etc. <br>
(R&amp;NAME) true if directly inside named capture <br>
(DEFINE) always false; for defining named subpatterns</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> shows
whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown Unicode option letter
&rsquo;%c&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified an unknown
Unicode option. See perlrun documentation of the
&quot;&minus;C&quot; switch for the list of known
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown Unicode option value
%d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified an unknown
Unicode option. See perlrun documentation of the
&quot;&minus;C&quot; switch for the list of known
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown user-defined property
name \p{%s}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified to use a
property within the &quot;\p{...}&quot; which was a
syntactically valid user-defined property, but no definition
was found for it by the time one was required to proceed.
Check your spelling. See &quot;User-Defined Character
Properties&quot; in perlunicode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown verb pattern
&rsquo;%s&rsquo; in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You either made a typo or
have incorrectly put a &quot;*&quot; quantifier after an
open brace in your pattern. Check the pattern and review
perlre for details on legal verb patterns.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unknown warnings category
&rsquo;%s&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An error issued by the
&quot;warnings&quot; pragma. You specified a warnings
category that is unknown to perl at this point.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
you want to enable a warnings category registered by a
module (e.g. &quot;use warnings 'File::Find'&quot;), you
must have loaded this module first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unmatched [ in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The brackets around a
character class must match. If you wish to include a closing
bracket in a character class, backslash it or put it first.
The &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> shows
whereabouts in the regular expression the problem was
discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unmatched ( in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/ <br>
Unmatched ) in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Unbackslashed parentheses
must always be balanced in regular expressions. If
you&rsquo;re a vi user, the % key is valuable for finding
the matching parenthesis. The &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> shows whereabouts in the regular
expression the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unmatched right %s bracket</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer counted more
closing curly or square brackets than opening ones, so
you&rsquo;re probably missing a matching opening bracket. As
a general rule, you&rsquo;ll find the missing one (so to
speak) near the place you were last editing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unquoted string &quot;%s&quot;
may clash with future reserved word</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W reserved) You used a
bareword that might someday be claimed as a reserved word.
It&rsquo;s best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize
it somehow, or insert an underbar into it. You might also
declare it as a subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized character %s;
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> after
%s near column %d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The Perl parser has no idea
what to do with the specified character in your Perl script
(or eval) near the specified column. Perhaps you tried to
run a compressed script, a binary program, or a directory as
a Perl program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized escape \%c in
character class in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> <br>
in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl inside character classes. This is a fatal error when
the character class is used within &quot;(?[ ])&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized escape \%c in
character class passed through in regex; <br>
marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl inside character classes. The character was understood
literally, but this may change in a future version of Perl.
The &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> shows
whereabouts in the regular expression the escape was
discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized escape \%c passed
through</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl. The character was understood literally, but this may
change in a future version of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized escape \%s passed
through in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in <br>
m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used a
backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
Perl. The character(s) were understood literally, but this
may change in a future version of Perl. The
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> shows
whereabouts in the regular expression the escape was
discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized signal name
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified a signal name
to the <b>kill()</b> function that was not recognized. Say
&quot;kill &minus;l&quot; in your shell to see the valid
signal names on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unrecognized switch: &minus;%s
(&minus;h will show valid options)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You specified an illegal
option to Perl. Don&rsquo;t do that. (If you think you
didn&rsquo;t do that, check the #! line to see if it&rsquo;s
supplying the bad switch on your behalf.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsuccessful %s on filename
containing newline</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W newline) A file operation
was attempted on a filename, and that operation failed,
<small>PROBABLY</small> because the filename contained a
newline, <small>PROBABLY</small> because you forgot to
<b>chomp()</b> it off. See &quot;chomp&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported directory function
&quot;%s&quot; called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t
support <b>opendir()</b> and <b>readdir()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported function %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This machine doesn&rsquo;t
implement the indicated function, apparently. At least,
Configure doesn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported function fork</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your version of executable
does not support forking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that under
some systems, like <small>OS/2,</small> there may be
different flavors of Perl executables, some of which may
support fork, some not. Try changing the name you call Perl
by to &quot;perl_&quot;, &quot;perl__&quot;, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported script encoding
%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your program file begins
with a Unicode Byte Order Mark ( <small>BOM</small> ) which
declares it to be in a Unicode encoding that Perl cannot
read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unsupported socket function
&quot;%s&quot; called</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Your machine doesn&rsquo;t
support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at least
that&rsquo;s what Configure thought.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated
&rsquo;(*...&rsquo; argument in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a pattern of the
form &quot;(*...:...)&quot; but did not terminate the
pattern with a &quot;)&quot;. Fix the pattern and retry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated attribute list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer found something
other than a simple identifier at the start of an attribute,
and it wasn&rsquo;t a semicolon or the start of a block.
Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous
attribute too soon. See attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated attribute
parameter in attribute list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer saw an opening
(left) parenthesis character while parsing an attribute
list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis character
was not found. You may need to add (or remove) a backslash
character to get your parentheses to balance. See
attributes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated compressed
integer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) An argument to
unpack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was incompatible with the
<small>BER</small> compressed integer format and could not
be converted to an integer. See &quot;pack&quot; in
perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated
&rsquo;(*...&rsquo; construct in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a pattern of the
form &quot;(*...)&quot; but did not terminate the pattern
with a &quot;)&quot;. Fix the pattern and retry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated delimiter for here
document</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) This message occurs when a
here document label has an initial quotation mark but the
final quotation mark is missing. Perhaps you wrote:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;&lt;&quot;foo</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">instead of:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;&lt;&quot;foo&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated \g... pattern in

Unterminated \g{...} pattern in regex; marked by
&lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp; <small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) In a regular expression,
you had a &quot;\g&quot; that wasn&rsquo;t followed by a
proper group reference. In the case of &quot;\g{&quot;, the
closing brace is missing; otherwise the &quot;\g&quot; must
be followed by an integer. Fix the pattern and retry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated &lt;&gt;
operator</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The lexer saw a left angle
bracket in a place where it was expecting a term, so
it&rsquo;s looking for the corresponding right angle
bracket, and not finding it. Chances are you left some
needed parentheses out earlier in the line, and you really
meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated verb pattern
argument in regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unterminated verb pattern in
regex; marked by &lt;&minus;&minus;&nbsp;
<small>HERE</small> in m/%s/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used a pattern of the
form &quot;(*VERB)&quot; but did not terminate the pattern
with a &quot;)&quot;. Fix the pattern and retry.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">untie attempted while %d inner
references still exist</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W untie) A copy of the object
returned from &quot;tie&quot; (or &quot;tied&quot;) was
still valid when &quot;untie&quot; was called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Usage: POSIX::%s(%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called a
<small>POSIX</small> function with incorrect arguments. See
&quot; <small>FUNCTIONS&quot;</small> in
<small>POSIX</small> for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Usage: Win32::%s(%s)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You called a Win32 function
with incorrect arguments. See Win32 for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">$[ used in %s (did you mean $]
?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You used $[ in a
comparison, such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">if ($[ &gt;
5.006) { <br>
... <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You probably
meant to use $] instead. $[ is the base for indexing arrays.
$] is the Perl version number in decimal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use &quot;%s&quot; instead of
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The second listed construct
is no longer legal. Use the first one instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Useless assignment to a
temporary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You assigned to an
lvalue subroutine, but what the subroutine returned was a
temporary scalar about to be discarded, so the assignment
had no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Useless (?&minus;%s) &minus;
don&rsquo;t use /%s modifier in regex; marked by

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W void) You did something
without a side effect in a context that does nothing with
the return value, such as a statement that doesn&rsquo;t
return a value from a block, or the left side of a scalar
comma operator. Very often this points not to stupidity on
your part, but a failure of Perl to parse your program the
way you thought it would. For example, you&rsquo;d get this
if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and
said</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$one, $two = 1,

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The square
brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar value,
while parentheses do not. So when a parenthesized list is
evaluated in a scalar context, the comma is treated like

possible in principle that push(@tied_array) could have some

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S
experimental::args_array_with_signatures) An expression

code points up to 0x10FFFF, but Perl allows much larger
ones. Earlier versions of Perl allowed code points above
<small>IV_MAX</small> (0x7FFFFFF on 32&minus;bit platforms,
0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF on 64&minus;bit platforms), however, this

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The construction &quot;my
$x := 42&quot; used to parse as equivalent to &quot;my $x :

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of freed value in

@a = () for (1,2,@a);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You are not
supposed to modify arrays while they are being iterated
over. For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does
not do full reference-counting of iterated items, hence
deleting such an item in the middle of an iteration causes
Perl to see a freed value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of /g modifier is
meaningless in split</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) You used the /g

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of &quot;goto&quot; to jump

&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; subroutines were looked up as methods

autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
&quot;Foo::bar()&quot;), not as methods (e.g.

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of &rsquo;%s&rsquo; is

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D deprecated) You used the

the scope of
&quot;use&nbsp;feature&nbsp;'extra_paired_delimiters'&quot;.
This character is the mirror image of another Unicode
character; within the scope of that feature, the two are
considered a pair for delimitting strings. It is planned to
make that feature the default, at which point this usage
would become illegal; hence this warning.</p>

may live with this warning, or turn it off, but this code
will no longer compile in a future version of Perl. Or you
can turn on

Unicode property wildcard subpatterns in <br>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You were using a wildcard

Values&quot; in perlunicode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of &minus;l on
filehandle%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W io) A filehandle represents
an opened file, and when you opened the file it already went
past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for. The
operation returned &quot;undef&quot;. Use a filename
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of reference &quot;%s&quot;
as array index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W misc) You tried to use a
reference as an array index; this probably isn&rsquo;t what
you mean, because references in numerical context tend to be
huge numbers, and so usually indicates programmer error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you really
do mean it, explicitly numify your reference, like so:
$array[0+$ref]. This warning is not given for overloaded

what you are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of strings with code points

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of tainted arguments in %s

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W taint, deprecated) You have
supplied &quot;system()&quot; or &quot;exec()&quot; with
multiple arguments and at least one of them is tainted. This
used to be allowed but will become a fatal error in a future
version of perl. Untaint your arguments. See perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of unassigned code point or
non-standalone grapheme for a delimiter <br>
is not allowed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A grapheme is what appears
to a native-speaker of a language to be a character. In
Unicode (and hence Perl) a grapheme may actually be several
adjacent characters that together form a complete grapheme.
For example, there can be a base character, like
&quot;R&quot; and an accent, like a circumflex
&quot;^&quot;, that appear when displayed to be a single
character with the circumflex hovering over the
&quot;R&quot;. Perl currently allows things like that
circumflex to be delimiters of strings, patterns,
<i>etc</i>. When displayed, the circumflex would look like
it belongs to the character just to the left of it. In order
to move the language to be able to accept graphemes as
delimiters, we cannot allow the use of delimiters which
aren&rsquo;t graphemes by themselves. Also, a delimiter must
already be assigned (or known to be never going to be
assigned) to try to future-proof code, for otherwise code
that works today would fail to compile if the currently
unassigned delimiter ends up being something that
isn&rsquo;t a stand-alone grapheme. Because Unicode is never
going to assign non-character code points, nor code points
that are above the legal Unicode maximum, those can be
delimiters, and their use is legal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of uninitialized
value%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W uninitialized) An undefined
value was used as if it were already defined. It was
interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a 0, but maybe it was a
mistake. To suppress this warning assign a defined value to
your variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To help you
figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you the
name of the variable (if any) that was undefined. In some
cases it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation
you used the undefined value in. Note, however, that perl
optimizes your program and the operation displayed in the
warning may not necessarily appear literally in your
program. For example, &quot;that $foo&quot; is usually
optimized into &quot;&quot;that &quot; . $foo&quot;, and the
warning will refer to the &quot;concatenation (.)&quot;
operator, even though there is no &quot;.&quot; in your
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;use re
&rsquo;strict&rsquo;&quot; is experimental</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S experimental::re_strict) The
things that are different when a regular expression pattern
is compiled under 'strict' are subject to change in future
Perl releases in incompatible ways. This means that a
pattern that compiles today may not in a future Perl
release. This warning is to alert you to that risk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W regexp) Named Unicode
character escapes &quot;(\N{...})&quot; may return a
multi-character sequence. Even though a character class is
supposed to match just one character of input, perl will
match the whole thing correctly, except when the class is
inverted (&quot;[^...]&quot;), or the escape is the
beginning or final end point of a range. For these, what
should happen isn&rsquo;t clear at all. In these
circumstances, Perl discards all but the first character of
the returned sequence, which is not likely what you
want.</p>

These two modifiers indicate an <small>ASCII</small>
interpretation, and this doesn&rsquo;t make sense for a
Unicode definition. The generated regular expression will
compile so that the boundary uses all of Unicode. No other
portion of the regular expression is affected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Using !~ with %s doesn&rsquo;t

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Using the &quot;!~&quot;

they are not considered acceptable. These code points,
between U+D800 and U+DFFF (inclusive), are used by Unicode
only for <small>UTF&minus;16.</small> However, Perl
internally allows all unsigned integer code points (up to
the size limit available on your platform), including
surrogates. But these can cause problems when being input or
output, which is likely where this message came from. If you
really really know what you are doing you can turn off this
warning by &quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Value of %s can be

&lt;*&gt; (glob), &quot;each()&quot;, or
&quot;readdir()&quot; as a boolean value. Each of these
constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would
make the conditional expression false, which is probably not
what you intended. When using these constructs in
conditional expressions, test their values with the

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not
available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closure) During compilation,
an inner named subroutine or eval is attempting to capture
an outer lexical that is not currently available. This can
happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may
be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not
yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at
compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.)
For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub { my $a;
sub f { $a } }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At the time
that f is created, it can&rsquo;t capture the current value
of $a, since the anonymous subroutine hasn&rsquo;t been
created yet. Conversely, the following won&rsquo;t give a
warning since the anonymous subroutine has by now been
created and is live:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub { my $a;
eval 'sub f { $a }' }&minus;&gt;();</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The second
situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable that has
gone out of scope, for example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub f { <br>
my $a; <br>
sub { eval '$a' } <br>
} <br>
f()&minus;&gt;();</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here, when the
&rsquo;$a&rsquo; in the eval is being compiled, f() is not
currently being executed, so its $a is not available for
capture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not
imported%s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S misc) With &quot;use
strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global variable
that you apparently thought was imported from another
module, because something else of the same name (usually a
subroutine) is exported by that module. It usually means you
put the wrong funny character on the front of your variable.
It is also possible you used an &quot;our&quot; variable
whose scope has ended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Variable length lookbehind not

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) <b>This message no longer
should be raised as of Perl 5.30.</b> It is retained in this
document as a convenience for people using an earlier Perl
version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.30
and earlier, lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions
whose length is fixed and known at compile time. For
positive lookbehind, you can use the &quot;\K&quot; regex
construct as a way to get the equivalent functionality. See
(?&lt;=pattern) and \K in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Starting in
Perl 5.18, there are non-obvious Unicode rules under
&quot;/i&quot; that can match variably, but which you might
not think could. For example, the substring &quot;ss&quot;
can match the single character <small>LATIN SMALL LETTER
SHARP S.</small> Here&rsquo;s a complete list of the current
ones affecting <small>ASCII</small> characters:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This list is
subject to change, but is quite unlikely to. Each
<small>ASCII</small> sequence can be any combination of
upper&minus; and lowercase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can avoid
this by using a bracketed character class in the lookbehind

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Another option
for Perls starting with 5.16, if you only care about

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W closure) An inner (nested)

defined in an outer named subroutine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the inner
subroutine is called, it will see the value of the outer

the first call to the outer subroutine is complete, the
inner and outer subroutines will no longer share a common
value for the variable. In other words, the variable will no
longer be shared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
can usually be solved by making the inner subroutine
anonymous, using the &quot;sub {}&quot; syntax. When inner
anonymous subs that reference variables in outer subroutines

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Because various
errors may only be detected by <b>close()</b> (e.g.
buffering could allow the &quot;print&quot; in this example
to return true even when the disk is full), it is dangerous
to ignore its result. So when it happens implicitly, perl
will signal errors by warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Wide character in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S utf8) Perl met a wide
character (ordinal &gt;255) when it wasn&rsquo;t expecting
one. This warning is by default on for I/O (like print).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If this warning
does come from I/O, the easiest way to quiet it is simply to
add the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer, <i>e.g.</i>,
&quot;binmode&nbsp;STDOUT,&nbsp;':utf8'&quot;. Another way
to turn off the warning is to add
&quot;no&nbsp;warnings&nbsp;'utf8';&quot; but that is often
closer to cheating. In general, you are supposed to
explicitly mark the filehandle with an encoding, see open
and &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the warning
comes from other than I/O, this diagnostic probably
indicates that incorrect results are being obtained. You
should examine your code to determine how a wide character
is getting to an operation that doesn&rsquo;t handle
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Wide character (U+%X) in %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W locale) While in a
single-byte locale (<i>i.e.</i>, a non&minus;UTF&minus;8
one), a multi-byte character was encountered. Perl considers
this character to be the specified Unicode code point.
Combining non&minus;UTF&minus;8 locales and Unicode is
dangerous. Almost certainly some characters will have two
different representations. For example, in the <small>ISO
8859&minus;7</small> (Greek) locale, the code point 0xC3
represents a Capital Gamma. But so also does 0x393. This
will make string comparisons unreliable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You likely need
to figure out how this multi-byte character got mixed up
with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you had
a <small>UTF&minus;8</small> locale, but Perl
disagrees).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Within []&minus;length
&rsquo;%c&rsquo; not allowed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The count in the (un)pack
template may be replaced by &quot;[TEMPLATE]&quot; only if
&quot;TEMPLATE&quot; always matches the same amount of
packed bytes that can be determined from the template alone.
This is not possible if it contains any of the codes @, /,
U, u, w or a *&minus;length. Redesign the template.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">While trying to resolve method
call %s&minus;&gt;%s() can not locate package <br>
&quot;%s&quot; yet it is mentioned in @%s::ISA (perhaps you
forgot to load &quot;%s&quot;?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) It is possible that
the @ISA contains a misspelled or never loaded package name,
which can result in perl choosing an unexpected parent
class&rsquo;s method to resolve the method call. If this is
deliberate you can do something like</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">@Missing::Package::ISA
= ();</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">to silence the

call.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s &quot;\x%X&quot; does not
map to Unicode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S utf8) When reading in
different encodings, Perl tries to map everything into
Unicode characters. The bytes you read in are not legal in
this encoding. For example</p>

perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&rsquo;x&rsquo; outside of

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>YOU HAVEN</small>
&rsquo;T <small>DISABLED</small> SET-ID <small>SCRIPTS IN

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) And you probably never
will, because you probably don&rsquo;t have the sources to
your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn&rsquo;t give a
rip about what you want. There is a vulnerability anywhere
that you have a set-id script, and to close it you need to
remove the set-id bit from the script that you&rsquo;re
attempting to run. To actually run the script set-id, your
best bet is to put a set-id C wrapper around your
script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">You need to quote
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W syntax) You assigned a
bareword as a signal handler name. Unfortunately, you
already have a subroutine of that name declared, which means
that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the
assignment is executed, which is probably not what you want.
(If it <small>IS</small> what you want, put an &amp; in
front.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Your random numbers are not

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) When trying to initialize
the random seed for hashes, Perl could not get any
