<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
briefly describes Perl under Mac <small>OS X.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">curl &minus;O
https://www.cpan.org/src/perl&minus;5.36.1.tar.gz <br>
tar &minus;xzf perl&minus;5.36.1.tar.gz <br>
cd perl&minus;5.36.1 <br>

sudo make install</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The latest Perl
release (5.36.1 as of this writing) builds without changes
under all versions of Mac <small>OS X</small> from 10.3
&quot;Panther&quot; onwards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
build your own version of Perl you will need
&rsquo;make&rsquo;, which is part of Apple&rsquo;s developer
tools &minus; also known as Xcode. From Mac <small>OS X
10.7</small> &quot;Lion&quot; onwards, it can be downloaded
separately as the &rsquo;Command Line Tools&rsquo; bundle
directly from &lt;https://developer.apple.com/downloads/&gt;
(you will need a free account to log in), or as a part of
the Xcode suite, freely available at the App Store. Xcode is
a pretty big app, so unless you already have it or really
want it, you are advised to get the &rsquo;Command Line
Tools&rsquo; bundle separately from the link above. If you
want to do it from within Xcode, go to Xcode &minus;&gt;
Preferences &minus;&gt; Downloads and select the
&rsquo;Command Line Tools&rsquo; option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Between Mac
<small>OS X 10.3</small> &quot;Panther&quot; and 10.6
&quot;Snow Leopard&quot;, the &rsquo;Command Line
Tools&rsquo; bundle was called &rsquo;unix tools&rsquo;, and
was usually supplied with Mac <small>OS</small> install
DVDs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Earlier Mac
<small>OS X</small> releases (10.2 &quot;Jaguar&quot; and
older) did not include a completely thread-safe libc, so
threading is not fully supported. Also, earlier releases
included a buggy libdb, so some of the DB_File tests are
known to fail on those releases.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Installation
Prefix</b> <br>
The default installation location for this release uses the
traditional <small>UNIX</small> directory layout under
/usr/local. This is the recommended location for most users,
and will leave the Apple-supplied Perl and its modules
undisturbed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using an
installation prefix of &rsquo;/usr&rsquo; will result in a
directory layout that mirrors that of Apple&rsquo;s default
Perl, with core modules stored in
&rsquo;/System/Library/Perl/${version}&rsquo;,
<small>CPAN</small> modules stored in
&rsquo;/Library/Perl/${version}&rsquo;, and the addition of
&rsquo;/Network/Library/Perl/${version}&rsquo; to @INC for
modules that are stored on a file server and used by many
Macs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>SDK</small>
support</b> <br>
First, export the path to the <small>SDK</small> into the
build environment:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">export
SDK=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please make
sure the <small>SDK</small> version (i.e. the numbers right
before &rsquo;.sdk&rsquo;) matches your system&rsquo;s (in
this case, Mac <small>OS X 10.8</small> &quot;Mountain
Lion&quot;), as it is possible to have more than one
<small>SDK</small> installed. Also make sure the path exists
in your system, and if it doesn&rsquo;t please make sure the
<small>SDK</small> is properly installed, as it should come
with the &rsquo;Command Line Tools&rsquo; bundle mentioned
above. Finally, if you have an older Mac <small>OS X</small>
(10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; and below) running Xcode 4.2
or lower, the <small>SDK</small> path might be something
like '/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk'.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use the
<small>SDK</small> by exporting some additions to
Perl&rsquo;s &rsquo;ccflags&rsquo; and &rsquo;..flags&rsquo;
config variables:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">./Configure
&minus;Accflags=&quot;&minus;nostdinc
&minus;B$SDK/usr/include/gcc \ <br>
&minus;B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc &minus;isystem$SDK/usr/include \
<br>
&minus;F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks&quot; \ <br>

&minus;Aldflags=&quot;&minus;Wl,&minus;syslibroot,$SDK&quot;
\ <br>
&minus;de</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Universal
Binary support</b> <br>
Note: From Mac <small>OS X 10.6</small> &quot;Snow
Leopard&quot; onwards, Apple only supports Intel-based
hardware. This means you can safely skip this section unless
you have an older Apple computer running on ppc or wish to
create a perl binary with backwards compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can compile
perl as a universal binary (built for both ppc and intel).
In Mac <small>OS X 10.4</small> &quot;Tiger&quot;, you must
export the &rsquo;u&rsquo; variant of the
<small>SDK:</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">export
SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mac <small>OS X
10.5</small> &quot;Leopard&quot; and above do not require
the &rsquo;u&rsquo; variant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the compiler flags used to select the <small>SDK,</small>
also add the flags for creating a universal binary:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">./Configure
&minus;Accflags=&quot;&minus;arch i686 &minus;arch ppc
&minus;nostdinc \ <br>
&minus;B$SDK/usr/include/gcc \ <br>
&minus;B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc &minus;isystem$SDK/usr/include \
<br>
&minus;F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks&quot; \ <br>
&minus;Aldflags=&quot;&minus;arch i686 &minus;arch ppc
&minus;Wl,&minus;syslibroot,$SDK&quot; \ <br>
&minus;de</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind
that these compiler and linker settings will also be used
when building <small>CPAN</small> modules. For
<small>XS</small> modules to be compiled as a universal
binary, any libraries it links to must also be universal
binaries. The system libraries that Apple includes with the
10.4u <small>SDK</small> are all universal, but
user-installed libraries may need to be re-installed as
universal binaries.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>64&minus;bit
<small>PPC</small> support</b> <br>
Follow the instructions in <i><small>INSTALL</small></i> to
build perl with support for 64&minus;bit integers
(&quot;use64bitint&quot;) or both 64&minus;bit integers and
64&minus;bit addressing (&quot;use64bitall&quot;). In the
latter case, the resulting binary will run only on
G5&minus;based hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
64&minus;bit addressing is experimental: some aspects of
Perl may be omitted or buggy. Note the messages output by
<i>Configure</i> for further information. Please use
&lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt; to submit a
problem report in the event that you encounter
difficulties.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When building
64&minus;bit modules, it is your responsibility to ensure
that linked external libraries and frameworks provide
64&minus;bit support: if they do not, module building may
appear to succeed, but attempts to use the module will
result in run-time dynamic linking errors, and subsequent
test failures. You can use &quot;file&quot; to discover the
architectures supported by a library:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$ file
libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib <br>
libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib: Mach&minus;O fat file with 2
architectures <br>
libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc): Mach&minus;O
dynamically linked shared library ppc <br>
libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc64): Mach&minus;O
64&minus;bit dynamically linked shared library ppc64</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
issue precludes the building of many Macintosh-specific
<small>CPAN</small> modules (&quot;Mac::*&quot;), as the
required Apple frameworks do not provide
<small>PPC64</small> support. Similarly, downloads from Fink
or Darwinports are unlikely to provide 64&minus;bit support;
the libraries must be rebuilt from source with the
appropriate compiler and linker flags. For further
information, see Apple&rsquo;s <i>64&minus;Bit Transition
Guide</i> at
&lt;https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/64bitPorting/transition/transition.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>libperl and
Prebinding</b> <br>
Mac <small>OS X</small> ships with a dynamically-loaded
libperl, but the default for this release is to compile a
static libperl. The reason for this is pre-binding. Dynamic
libraries can be pre-bound to a specific address in memory
in order to decrease load time. To do this, one needs to be
aware of the location and size of all previously-loaded
libraries. Apple collects this information as part of their
overall <small>OS</small> build process, and thus has easy
access to it when building Perl, but ordinary users would
need to go to a great deal of effort to obtain the
information needed for pre-binding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can
override the default and build a shared libperl if you wish
(Configure&nbsp;...&nbsp;&minus;Duseshrplib).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">With Mac
<small>OS X 10.4</small> &quot;Tiger&quot; and newer, there
is almost no performance penalty for non-prebound libraries.
Earlier releases will suffer a greater load time than either
the static library, or Apple&rsquo;s pre-bound dynamic
library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Updating
Apple&rsquo;s Perl</b> <br>
In a word &minus; don&rsquo;t, at least not without a *very*
good reason. Your scripts can just as easily begin with
&quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot; as with
&quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;. Scripts supplied by Apple and
other third parties as part of installation packages and
such have generally only been tested with the /usr/bin/perl
that&rsquo;s installed by Apple.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you find
that you do need to update the system Perl, one issue worth
keeping in mind is the question of static vs. dynamic
libraries. If you upgrade using the default static libperl,
you will find that the dynamic libperl supplied by Apple
will not be deleted. If both libraries are present when an
application that links against libperl is built, ld will
link against the dynamic library by default. So, if you need
to replace Apple&rsquo;s dynamic libperl with a static
libperl, you need to be sure to delete the older dynamic
library after you&rsquo;ve installed the update.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Known
problems</b> <br>
If you have installed extra libraries such as
<small>GDBM</small> through Fink (in other words, you have
libraries under <i>/sw/lib</i>), or libdlcompat to
<i>/usr/local/lib</i>, you may need to be extra careful when
running Configure to not to confuse Configure and Perl about
which libraries to use. Being confused will show up for
example as &quot;dyld&quot; errors about symbol problems,
for example during &quot;make test&quot;. The safest bet is
to run Configure as</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Configure ...
&minus;Uloclibpth &minus;Dlibpth=/usr/lib</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to make
Configure look only into the system libraries. If you have
some extra library directories that you really want to use
(such as newer Berkeley <small>DB</small> libraries in
pre-Panther systems), add those to the libpth:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Configure ...
&minus;Uloclibpth &minus;Dlibpth='/usr/lib /opt/lib'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default of
building Perl statically may cause problems with complex
applications like Tk: in that case consider building shared
Perl</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Configure ...
&minus;Duseshrplib</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but remember
that there&rsquo;s a startup cost to pay in that case (see
above &quot;libperl and Prebinding&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
Tiger (Mac <small>OS X 10.4</small> ), Apple shipped broken
locale files for the eu_ES locale (Basque-Spain). In
previous releases of Perl, this resulted in failures in the
<i>lib/locale</i> test. These failures have been suppressed
in the current release of Perl by making the test ignore the
broken locale. If you need to use the eu_ES locale, you
should contact Apple support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Cocoa</b>
<br>
There are two ways to use Cocoa from Perl. Apple&rsquo;s
PerlObjCBridge module, included with Mac <small>OS
X,</small> can be used by standalone scripts to access
Foundation (i.e. non-GUI) classes and objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
is CamelBones, a framework that allows access to both
Foundation and AppKit classes and objects, so that full
<small>GUI</small> applications can be built in Perl.
CamelBones can be found on SourceForge, at
&lt;https://www.sourceforge.net/projects/camelbones/&gt;.</p>

<h2>Starting From Scratch
<a name="Starting From Scratch"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately
it is not that difficult somehow manage to break one&rsquo;s
Mac <small>OS X</small> Perl rather severely. If all else
fails and you want to really, <b><small>REALLY</small></b> ,
start from scratch and remove even your Apple Perl
installation (which has become corrupted somehow), the
following instructions should do it. <b>Please think twice
before following these instructions: they are much like
conducting brain surgery to yourself. Without
anesthesia.</b> We will <b>not</b> come to fix your system
if you do this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First, get rid
of the libperl.dylib:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># cd
/System/Library/Perl/darwin/CORE <br>
# rm libperl.dylib</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then delete
every .bundle file found anywhere in the folders:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">/System/Library/Perl
<br>
/Library/Perl</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can find
them for example by</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># find
/System/Library/Perl /Library/Perl &minus;name '*.bundle'
&minus;print</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After this you
can either copy Perl from your operating system media (you
will need at least the /System/Library/Perl and
/usr/bin/perl), or rebuild Perl from the source code with
&quot;Configure &minus;Dprefix=/usr &minus;Duseshrplib&quot;
<small>NOTE:</small> the &quot;&minus;Dprefix=/usr&quot; to
replace the system Perl works much better with Perl 5.8.1
and later, in Perl 5.8.0 the settings were not quite
right.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Pacifist&quot;
from CharlesSoft (&lt;https://www.charlessoft.com/&gt;) is a
nice way to extract the Perl binaries from the
<small>OS</small> media, without having to reinstall the
entire <small>OS.</small></p>
