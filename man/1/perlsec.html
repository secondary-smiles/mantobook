<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl is
designed to make it easy to program securely even when
running with extra privileges, like setuid or setgid
programs. Unlike most command line shells, which are based
on multiple substitution passes on each line of the script,
Perl uses a more conventional evaluation scheme with fewer
hidden snags. Additionally, because the language has more
builtin functionality, it can rely less upon external (and
possibly untrustworthy) programs to accomplish its
purposes.</p>

<h2>SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION
<a name="SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
you have found a security vulnerability in the Perl
interpreter or modules maintained in the core Perl codebase,
email the details to perl&minus;security@perl.org
&lt;mailto:perl-security@perl.org&gt;. This address is a
closed membership mailing list monitored by the Perl
security team.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
perlsecpolicy for additional information.</p>

<h2>SECURITY MECHANISMS AND CONCERNS
<a name="SECURITY MECHANISMS AND CONCERNS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Taint
mode</b> <br>
By default, Perl automatically enables a set of special
security checks, called <i>taint mode</i>, when it detects
its program running with differing real and effective user
or group IDs. The setuid bit in Unix permissions is mode
04000, the setgid bit mode 02000; either or both may be set.
You can also enable taint mode explicitly by using the
<b>&minus;T</b> command line flag. This flag is
<i>strongly</i> suggested for server programs and any
program run on behalf of someone else, such as a
<small>CGI</small> script. Once taint mode is on, it&rsquo;s
on for the remainder of your script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While in this
mode, Perl takes special precautions called <i>taint
checks</i> to prevent both obvious and subtle traps. Some of
these checks are reasonably simple, such as verifying that
path directories aren&rsquo;t writable by others; careful
programmers have always used checks like these. Other
checks, however, are best supported by the language itself,
and it is these checks especially that contribute to making
a set-id Perl program more secure than the corresponding C
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may not use
data derived from outside your program to affect something
else outside your program--at least, not by accident. All
command line arguments, environment variables, locale
information (see perllocale), results of certain system
calls (&quot;readdir()&quot;, &quot;readlink()&quot;, the
variable of &quot;shmread()&quot;, the messages returned by
&quot;msgrcv()&quot;, the password, gcos and shell fields
returned by the &quot;getpwxxx()&quot; calls), and all file
input are marked as &quot;tainted&quot;. Tainted data may
not be used directly or indirectly in any command that
invokes a sub-shell, nor in any command that modifies files,
directories, or processes, <b>with the following
exceptions</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
taint checks adds an overhead to all Perl programs, whether
or not you&rsquo;re using the taint features. Perl 5.18
introduced C preprocessor symbols that can be used to
disable the taint features.</p>

carefully limit what these symbolic values are, people are

arbitrary external code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For efficiency
reasons, Perl takes a conservative view of whether data is
tainted. If an expression contains tainted data, any
subexpression may be considered tainted, even if the value
of the subexpression is not itself affected by the tainted
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because
taintedness is associated with each scalar value, some
elements of an array or hash can be tainted and others not.
The keys of a hash are <b>never</b> tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$arg = shift; #
$arg is tainted <br>
$hid = $arg . 'bar'; # $hid is also tainted <br>
$line = &lt;&gt;; # Tainted <br>
$line = &lt;STDIN&gt;; # Also tainted <br>
open FOO, &quot;/home/me/bar&quot; or die $!; <br>
$line = &lt;FOO&gt;; # Still tainted <br>
$path = $ENV{'PATH'}; # Tainted, but see below <br>
$data = 'abc'; # Not tainted <br>
system &quot;echo $arg&quot;; # Insecure <br>
system &quot;/bin/echo&quot;, $arg; # Considered insecure
<br>
# (Perl doesn't know about /bin/echo) <br>
system &quot;echo $hid&quot;; # Insecure <br>
system &quot;echo $data&quot;; # Insecure until PATH set
<br>
$path = $ENV{'PATH'}; # $path now tainted <br>
$ENV{'PATH'} = '/bin:/usr/bin'; <br>
delete @ENV{'IFS', 'CDPATH', 'ENV', 'BASH_ENV'}; <br>
$path = $ENV{'PATH'}; # $path now NOT tainted <br>
system &quot;echo $data&quot;; # Is secure now! <br>
open(FOO, &quot;&lt; $arg&quot;); # OK &minus;
read&minus;only file <br>
open(FOO, &quot;&gt; $arg&quot;); # Not OK &minus; trying to
write <br>
open(FOO,&quot;echo $arg|&quot;); # Not OK <br>
open(FOO,&quot;&minus;|&quot;) <br>
or exec 'echo', $arg; # Also not OK <br>
$shout = `echo $arg`; # Insecure, $shout now tainted <br>
unlink $data, $arg; # Insecure <br>
umask $arg; # Insecure <br>
exec &quot;echo $arg&quot;; # Insecure <br>
exec &quot;echo&quot;, $arg; # Insecure <br>
exec &quot;sh&quot;, '&minus;c', $arg; # Very insecure! <br>
@files = &lt;*.c&gt;; # insecure (uses readdir() or similar)
<br>
@files = glob('*.c'); # insecure (uses readdir() or similar)
<br>
# In either case, the results of glob are tainted, since the
list of <br>
# filenames comes from outside of the program. <br>
$bad = ($arg, 23); # $bad will be tainted <br>
$arg, `true`; # Insecure (although it isn't really)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you try to
do something insecure, you will get a fatal error saying
something like &quot;Insecure dependency&quot; or
&quot;Insecure $ENV{ <small>PATH</small> }&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exception
to the principle of &quot;one tainted value taints the whole
expression&quot; is with the ternary conditional operator
&quot;?:&quot;. Since code with a ternary conditional</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$result =
$tainted_value ? &quot;Untainted&quot; : &quot;Also
untainted&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is
effectively</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if (
$tainted_value ) { <br>
$result = &quot;Untainted&quot;; <br>
} else { <br>
$result = &quot;Also untainted&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">it
doesn&rsquo;t make sense for $result to be tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Laundering
and Detecting Tainted Data</b> <br>
To test whether a variable contains tainted data, and whose
use would thus trigger an &quot;Insecure dependency&quot;
message, you can use the &quot;tainted()&quot; function of
the Scalar::Util module, available in your nearby
<small>CPAN</small> mirror, and included in Perl starting
from the release 5.8.0. Or you may be able to use the
following &quot;is_tainted()&quot; function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub is_tainted
{ <br>
local $@; # Don't pollute caller's value. <br>
return ! eval { eval(&quot;#&quot; .
substr(join(&quot;&quot;, @_), 0, 0)); 1 }; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This function
makes use of the fact that the presence of tainted data
anywhere within an expression renders the entire expression
tainted. It would be inefficient for every operator to test
every argument for taintedness. Instead, the slightly more
efficient and conservative approach is used that if any
tainted value has been accessed within the same expression,
the whole expression is considered tainted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But testing for
taintedness gets you only so far. Sometimes you have just to
clear your data&rsquo;s taintedness. Values may be untainted
by using them as keys in a hash; otherwise the only way to
bypass the tainting mechanism is by referencing subpatterns
from a regular expression match. Perl presumes that if you
reference a substring using $1, $2, etc. in a non-tainting
pattern, that you knew what you were doing when you wrote
that pattern. That means using a bit of thought--don&rsquo;t
just blindly untaint anything, or you defeat the entire
mechanism. It&rsquo;s better to verify that the variable has
only good characters (for certain values of
&quot;good&quot;) rather than checking whether it has any
bad characters. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s far too easy
to miss bad characters that you never thought of.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
test to make sure that the data contains nothing but
&quot;word&quot; characters (alphabetics, numerics, and
underscores), a hyphen, an at sign, or a dot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if ($data =~
/^([&minus;\@\w.]+)$/) { <br>
$data = $1; # $data now untainted <br>
} else { <br>
die &quot;Bad data in '$data'&quot;; # log this somewhere
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is fairly
secure because &quot;/\w+/&quot; doesn&rsquo;t normally
match shell metacharacters, nor are dot, dash, or at going
to mean something special to the shell. Use of
&quot;/.+/&quot; would have been insecure in theory because
it lets everything through, but Perl doesn&rsquo;t check for
that. The lesson is that when untainting, you must be
exceedingly careful with your patterns. Laundering data
using regular expression is the <i>only</i> mechanism for
untainting dirty data, unless you use the strategy detailed
below to fork a child of lesser privilege.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The example
does not untaint $data if &quot;use locale&quot; is in
effect, because the characters matched by &quot;\w&quot; are
determined by the locale. Perl considers that locale
definitions are untrustworthy because they contain data from
outside the program. If you are writing a locale-aware
program, and want to launder data with a regular expression
containing &quot;\w&quot;, put &quot;no locale&quot; ahead
of the expression in the same block. See &quot;
<small>SECURITY&quot;</small> in perllocale for further
discussion and examples.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Switches On
the &quot;#!&quot; Line</b> <br>
When you make a script executable, in order to make it
usable as a command, the system will pass switches to perl
from the script&rsquo;s #! line. Perl checks that any
command line switches given to a setuid (or setgid) script
actually match the ones set on the #! line. Some Unix and
Unix-like environments impose a one-switch limit on the #!
line, so you may need to use something like
&quot;&minus;wU&quot; instead of &quot;&minus;w
&minus;U&quot; under such systems. (This issue should arise
only in Unix or Unix-like environments that support #! and
setuid or setgid scripts.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Taint mode
and @INC</b> <br>
+When the taint mode (&quot;&minus;T&quot;) is in effect,
the environment variables +&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;,
&quot;PERLLIB&quot;, and &quot;PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC&quot; are
ignored by Perl. You can still adjust @INC from outside the
program by using the &quot;&minus;I&quot; command line
option as explained in perlrun. The two environment
variables are ignored because they are obscured, and a user
running a program could be unaware that they are set,
whereas the &quot;&minus;I&quot; option is clearly visible
and therefore permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another way to
modify @INC without modifying the program, is to use the
&quot;lib&quot; pragma, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl
&minus;Mlib=/foo program</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The benefit of
using &quot;&minus;Mlib=/foo&quot; over
&quot;&minus;I/foo&quot;, is that the former will
automagically remove any duplicated directories, while the
latter will not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if a
tainted string is added to @INC, the following problem will
be reported:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Insecure
dependency in require while running with &minus;T switch</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On versions of
Perl before 5.26, activating taint mode will also remove the
current directory (&quot;.&quot;) from the default value of
@INC. Since version 5.26, the current directory isn&rsquo;t
included in @INC by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Cleaning Up
Your Path</b> <br>
For &quot;Insecure $ENV{PATH}&quot; messages, you need to
set $ENV{'PATH'} to a known value, and each directory in the
path must be absolute and non-writable by others than its
owner and group. You may be surprised to get this message
even if the pathname to your executable is fully qualified.
This is <i>not</i> generated because you didn&rsquo;t supply
a full path to the program; instead, it&rsquo;s generated
because you never set your <small>PATH</small> environment
variable, or you didn&rsquo;t set it to something that was
safe. Because Perl can&rsquo;t guarantee that the executable
in question isn&rsquo;t itself going to turn around and
execute some other program that is dependent on your
<small>PATH,</small> it makes sure you set the
<small>PATH.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>PATH</small> isn&rsquo;t the only environment
variable which can cause problems. Because some shells may
use the variables <small>IFS, CDPATH, ENV,</small> and
<small>BASH_ENV,</small> Perl checks that those are either
empty or untainted when starting subprocesses. You may wish
to add something like this to your setid and taint-checking
scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">delete
@ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)}; # Make %ENV safer</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s also
possible to get into trouble with other operations that
don&rsquo;t care whether they use tainted values. Make
judicious use of the file tests in dealing with any
user-supplied filenames. When possible, do opens and such
<b>after</b> properly dropping any special user (or group!)
privileges. Perl doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from opening
tainted filenames for reading, so be careful what you print
out. The tainting mechanism is intended to prevent stupid
mistakes, not to remove the need for thought.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl does not
call the shell to expand wild cards when you pass
&quot;system&quot; and &quot;exec&quot; explicit parameter
lists instead of strings with possible shell wildcards in
them. Unfortunately, the &quot;open&quot;, &quot;glob&quot;,
and backtick functions provide no such alternate calling
convention, so more subterfuge will be required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl provides a
reasonably safe way to open a file or pipe from a setuid or
setgid program: just create a child process with reduced
privilege who does the dirty work for you. First, fork a
child using the special &quot;open&quot; syntax that
connects the parent and child by a pipe. Now the child
resets its <small>ID</small> set and any other per-process
attributes, like environment variables, umasks, current
working directories, back to the originals or known safe
values. Then the child process, which no longer has any
special permissions, does the &quot;open&quot; or other
system call. Finally, the child passes the data it managed
to access back to the parent. Because the file or pipe was
opened in the child while running under less privilege than
the parent, it&rsquo;s not apt to be tricked into doing
something it shouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
way to do backticks reasonably safely. Notice how the
&quot;exec&quot; is not called with a string that the shell
could expand. This is by far the best way to call something
that might be subjected to shell escapes: just never call
the shell at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use English;
<br>
die &quot;Can't fork: $!&quot; unless defined($pid =
open(KID, &quot;&minus;|&quot;)); <br>
if ($pid) { # parent <br>
while (&lt;KID&gt;) { <br>
# do something <br>
} <br>
close KID; <br>
} else { <br>
my @temp = ($EUID, $EGID); <br>
my $orig_uid = $UID; <br>
my $orig_gid = $GID; <br>
$EUID = $UID; <br>
$EGID = $GID; <br>
# Drop privileges <br>
$UID = $orig_uid; <br>
$GID = $orig_gid; <br>
# Make sure privs are really gone <br>
($EUID, $EGID) = @temp; <br>
die &quot;Can't drop privileges&quot; <br>
unless $UID == $EUID &amp;&amp; $GID eq $EGID; <br>
$ENV{PATH} = &quot;/bin:/usr/bin&quot;; # Minimal PATH. <br>
# Consider sanitizing the environment even more. <br>
exec 'myprog', 'arg1', 'arg2' <br>
or die &quot;can't exec myprog: $!&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A similar
strategy would work for wildcard expansion via
&quot;glob&quot;, although you can use &quot;readdir&quot;
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Taint checking
is most useful when although you trust yourself not to have
written a program to give away the farm, you don&rsquo;t
necessarily trust those who end up using it not to try to
trick it into doing something bad. This is the kind of
security checking that&rsquo;s useful for set-id programs
and programs launched on someone else&rsquo;s behalf, like
<small>CGI</small> programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is quite
different, however, from not even trusting the writer of the
code not to try to do something evil. That&rsquo;s the kind
of trust needed when someone hands you a program
you&rsquo;ve never seen before and says, &quot;Here, run
this.&quot; For that kind of safety, you might want to check
out the Safe module, included standard in the Perl
distribution. This module allows the programmer to set up
special compartments in which all system operations are
trapped and namespace access is carefully controlled. Safe
should not be considered bullet-proof, though: it will not
prevent the foreign code to set up infinite loops, allocate
gigabytes of memory, or even abusing perl bugs to make the
host interpreter crash or behave in unpredictable ways. In
any case it&rsquo;s better avoided completely if
you&rsquo;re really concerned about security.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Shebang Race
Condition</b> <br>
Beyond the obvious problems that stem from giving special
privileges to systems as flexible as scripts, on many
versions of Unix, set-id scripts are inherently insecure
right from the start. The problem is a race condition in the
kernel. Between the time the kernel opens the file to see
which interpreter to run and when the (now-set-id)
interpreter turns around and reopens the file to interpret
it, the file in question may have changed, especially if you
have symbolic links on your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some Unixes,
especially more recent ones, are free of this inherent
security bug. On such systems, when the kernel passes the
name of the set-id script to open to the interpreter, rather
than using a pathname subject to meddling, it instead passes
<i>/dev/fd/3</i>. This is a special file already opened on
the script, so that there can be no race condition for evil
scripts to exploit. On these systems, Perl should be
compiled with
&quot;&minus;DSETUID_SCRIPTS_ARE_SECURE_NOW&quot;. The
<i>Configure</i> program that builds Perl tries to figure
this out for itself, so you should never have to specify
this yourself. Most modern releases of SysVr4 and <small>BSD
4.4</small> use this approach to avoid the kernel race
condition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you
don&rsquo;t have the safe version of set-id scripts, all is
not lost. Sometimes this kernel &quot;feature&quot; can be
disabled, so that the kernel either doesn&rsquo;t run set-id
scripts with the set-id or doesn&rsquo;t run them at all.
Either way avoids the exploitability of the race condition,
but doesn&rsquo;t help in actually running scripts
set-id.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the kernel
set-id script feature isn&rsquo;t disabled, then any set-id
script provides an exploitable vulnerability. Perl
can&rsquo;t avoid being exploitable, but will point out
vulnerable scripts where it can. If Perl detects that it is
being applied to a set-id script then it will complain
loudly that your set-id script is insecure, and won&rsquo;t
run it. When Perl complains, you need to remove the set-id
bit from the script to eliminate the vulnerability. Refusing
to run the script doesn&rsquo;t in itself close the
vulnerability; it is just Perl&rsquo;s way of encouraging
you to do this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To actually run
a script set-id, if you don&rsquo;t have the safe version of
set-id scripts, you&rsquo;ll need to put a C wrapper around
the script. A C wrapper is just a compiled program that does
nothing except call your Perl program. Compiled programs are
not subject to the kernel bug that plagues set-id scripts.
Here&rsquo;s a simple wrapper, written in C:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#include
&lt;unistd.h&gt; <br>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; <br>
#include &lt;string.h&gt; <br>
#include &lt;errno.h&gt; <br>
#define REAL_PATH &quot;/path/to/script&quot; <br>
int main(int argc, char **argv) <br>
{ <br>
execv(REAL_PATH, argv); <br>
fprintf(stderr, &quot;%s: %s: %s\n&quot;, <br>
argv[0], REAL_PATH, strerror(errno)); <br>
return 127; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Compile this
wrapper into a binary executable and then make <i>it</i>
rather than your script setuid or setgid. Note that this
wrapper isn&rsquo;t doing anything to sanitise the execution
environment other than ensuring that a safe path to the
script is used. It only avoids the shebang race condition.
It relies on Perl&rsquo;s own features, and on the script
itself being careful, to make it safe enough to run the
script set-id.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Protecting
Your Programs</b> <br>
There are a number of ways to hide the source to your Perl
programs, with varying levels of &quot;security&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">First of all,
however, you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> take away read permission,
because the source code has to be readable in order to be
compiled and interpreted. (That doesn&rsquo;t mean that a
<small>CGI</small> script&rsquo;s source is readable by
people on the web, though.) So you have to leave the
permissions at the socially friendly 0755 level. This lets
people on your local system only see your source.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some people
mistakenly regard this as a security problem. If your
program does insecure things, and relies on people not
knowing how to exploit those insecurities, it is not secure.
It is often possible for someone to determine the insecure
things and exploit them without viewing the source. Security
through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs instead of
fixing them, is little security indeed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can try
using encryption via source filters (Filter::* from
<small>CPAN,</small> or Filter::Util::Call and
Filter::Simple since Perl 5.8). But crackers might be able
to decrypt it. You can try using the byte code compiler and
interpreter described below, but crackers might be able to
de-compile it. You can try using the native-code compiler
described below, but crackers might be able to disassemble
it. These pose varying degrees of difficulty to people
wanting to get at your code, but none can definitively
conceal it (this is true of every language, not just
Perl).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you&rsquo;re
concerned about people profiting from your code, then the
bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive license will
give you legal security. License your software and pepper it
with threatening statements like &quot;This is unpublished
proprietary software of <small>XYZ</small> Corp. Your access
to it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.&quot; You should see a lawyer to be sure your
license&rsquo;s wording will stand up in court.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Algorithmic
Complexity Attacks</b> <br>
Certain internal algorithms used in the implementation of
Perl can be attacked by choosing the input carefully to
consume large amounts of either time or space or both. This
can lead into the so-called <i>Denial of Service</i> (DoS)
attacks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Hash Algorithm &minus; Hash
algorithms like the one used in Perl are well known to be
vulnerable to collision attacks on their hash function. Such
attacks involve constructing a set of keys which collide
into the same bucket producing inefficient behavior. Such
attacks often depend on discovering the seed of the hash
function used to map the keys to buckets. That seed is then
used to brute-force a key set which can be used to mount a
denial of service attack. In Perl 5.8.1 changes were
introduced to harden Perl to such attacks, and then later in
Perl 5.18.0 these features were enhanced and additional
protections added.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At the time of
this writing, Perl 5.18.0 is considered to be well-hardened
against algorithmic complexity attacks on its hash
implementation. This is largely owed to the following
measures mitigate attacks: <br>
Hash Seed Randomization</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">In order to make it impossible
to know what seed to generate an attack key set for, this
seed is randomly initialized at process start. This may be
overridden by using the <small>PERL_HASH_SEED</small>
environment variable, see &quot;
<small>PERL_HASH_SEED&quot;</small> in perlrun. This
environment variable controls how items are actually stored,
not how they are presented via &quot;keys&quot;,
&quot;values&quot; and &quot;each&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Hash Traversal
Randomization</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">Independent of which seed is
used in the hash function, &quot;keys&quot;,
&quot;values&quot;, and &quot;each&quot; return items in a
per-hash randomized order. Modifying a hash by insertion
will change the iteration order of that hash. This behavior
can be overridden by using &quot;hash_traversal_mask()&quot;
from Hash::Util or by using the
<small>PERL_PERTURB_KEYS</small> environment variable, see
&quot; <small>PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;</small> in perlrun.
Note that this feature controls the &quot;visible&quot;
order of the keys, and not the actual order they are stored
in.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bucket Order Perturbance</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">When items collide into a given
hash bucket the order they are stored in the chain is no
longer predictable in Perl 5.18. This has the intention to
make it harder to observe a collision. This behavior can be
overridden by using the <small>PERL_PERTURB_KEYS</small>
environment variable, see &quot;
<small>PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;</small> in perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">New Default Hash Function</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The default hash function has
been modified with the intention of making it harder to
infer the hash seed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Alternative Hash Functions</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">The source code includes
multiple hash algorithms to choose from. While we believe
that the default perl hash is robust to attack, we have
included the hash function Siphash as a fall-back option. At
the time of release of Perl 5.18.0 Siphash is believed to be
of cryptographic strength. This is not the default as it is
much slower than the default hash.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Without
compiling a special Perl, there is no way to get the exact
same behavior of any versions prior to Perl 5.18.0. The
closest one can get is by setting
<small>PERL_PERTURB_KEYS</small> to 0 and setting the
<small>PERL_HASH_SEED</small> to a known value. We do not
advise those settings for production use due to the above
security considerations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl has
never guaranteed any ordering of the hash keys</b>, and the
ordering has already changed several times during the
lifetime of Perl 5. Also, the ordering of hash keys has
always been, and continues to be, affected by the insertion
order and the history of changes made to the hash over its
lifetime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also note that
while the order of the hash elements might be randomized,
this &quot;pseudo-ordering&quot; should <b>not</b> be used
for applications like shuffling a list randomly (use
&quot;List::Util::shuffle()&quot; for that, see List::Util,
a standard core module since Perl 5.8.0; or the
<small>CPAN</small> module
&quot;Algorithm::Numerical::Shuffle&quot;), or for
generating permutations (use e.g. the <small>CPAN</small>
modules &quot;Algorithm::Permute&quot; or
&quot;Algorithm::FastPermute&quot;), or for any
cryptographic applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Tied hashes may
have their own ordering and algorithmic complexity
attacks.</p>

<p>Regular expressions &minus; Perl&rsquo;s regular
expression engine is so called <small>NFA</small>
(Non-deterministic Finite Automaton), which among other
things means that it can rather easily consume large amounts
of both time and space if the regular expression may match
in several ways. Careful crafting of the regular expressions
can help but quite often there really isn&rsquo;t much one
can do (the book &quot;Mastering Regular Expressions&quot;
is required reading, see perlfaq2). Running out of space
manifests itself by Perl running out of memory.</p></td></tr>

<p>Sorting &minus; the quicksort algorithm used in Perls
before 5.8.0 to implement the <b>sort()</b> function was
very easy to trick into misbehaving so that it consumes a
lot of time. Starting from Perl 5.8.0 a different sorting
algorithm, mergesort, is used by default. Mergesort cannot
misbehave on any input.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
Sudo</b> <br>
The popular tool &quot;sudo&quot; provides a controlled way
for users to be able to run programs as other users. It
sanitises the execution environment to some extent, and will
avoid the shebang race condition. If you don&rsquo;t have
the safe version of set-id scripts, then &quot;sudo&quot;
may be a more convenient way of executing a script as
another user than writing a C wrapper would be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However,
&quot;sudo&quot; sets the real user or group
<small>ID</small> to that of the target identity, not just
the effective <small>ID</small> as set-id bits do. As a
result, Perl can&rsquo;t detect that it is running under
&quot;sudo&quot;, and so won&rsquo;t automatically take its
own security precautions such as turning on taint mode.
Where &quot;sudo&quot; configuration dictates exactly which
command can be run, the approved command may include a
&quot;&minus;T&quot; option to perl to enable taint
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, it
is necessary to evaluate the suitability of a script to run
under &quot;sudo&quot; specifically with that kind of
execution environment in mind. It is neither necessary nor
sufficient for the same script to be suitable to run in a
traditional set-id arrangement, though many of the issues
overlap.</p>
