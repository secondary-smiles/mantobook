<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The Syntax
of Variable Names</b> <br>
Variable names in Perl can have several formats. Usually,
they must begin with a letter or underscore, in which case
they can be arbitrarily long (up to an internal limit of 251
characters) and may contain letters, digits, underscores, or
the special sequence &quot;::&quot; or &quot;'&quot;. In
this case, the part before the last &quot;::&quot; or
&quot;'&quot; is taken to be a <i>package qualifier</i>; see
perlmod. A Unicode letter that is not <small>ASCII</small>
is not considered to be a letter unless
&quot;use&nbsp;utf8&quot; is in effect, and somewhat more
complicated rules apply; see &quot;Identifier parsing&quot;
in perldata for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl variable
names may also be a sequence of digits, a single punctuation
character, or the two-character sequence: &quot;^&quot;
(caret or <small>CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT</small> ) followed by any
one of the characters &quot;[][A&minus;Z^_?\]&quot;. These
names are all reserved for special uses by Perl; for
example, the all-digits names are used to hold data captured
by backreferences after a regular expression match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since Perl
v5.6.0, Perl variable names may also be alphanumeric strings
preceded by a caret. These must all be written using the
demarcated variable form using curly braces such as
&quot;${^Foo}&quot;; the braces are <b>not</b> optional.
&quot;${^Foo}&quot; denotes the scalar variable whose name
is considered to be a control&minus;&quot;F&quot; followed
by two &quot;o&quot;&rsquo;s. (See &quot;Demarcated variable
names using braces&quot; in perldata for more information on
this form of spelling a variable name or specifying access
to an element of an array or a hash). These variables are
reserved for future special uses by Perl, except for the
ones that begin with &quot;^_&quot; (caret-underscore). No
name that begins with &quot;^_&quot; will acquire a special
meaning in any future version of Perl; such names may
therefore be used safely in programs. $^_ itself, however,
<i>is</i> reserved.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
also <b>must</b> use the demarcated form to access
subscripts of variables of this type when interpolating, for
instance to access the first element of the
&quot;@{^CAPTURE}&quot; variable inside of a double quoted
string you would write &quot;${^CAPTURE[0]}&quot; and
<small>NOT</small> &quot;${^CAPTURE}[0]&quot; which would
mean to reference a scalar variable named
&quot;${^CAPTURE}&quot; and not index 0 of the magic
&quot;@{^CAPTURE}&quot; array which is populated by the
regex engine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl
identifiers that begin with digits or punctuation characters
are exempt from the effects of the &quot;package&quot;
declaration and are always forced to be in package
&quot;main&quot;; they are also exempt from &quot;strict
'vars'&quot; errors. A few other names are also exempt in
these ways:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ENV STDIN <br>
INC STDOUT <br>
ARGV STDERR <br>
ARGVOUT <br>
SIG</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In particular,
the special &quot;${^_XYZ}&quot; variables are always taken
to be in package &quot;main&quot;, regardless of any
&quot;package&quot; declarations presently in scope.</p>

<h2>SPECIAL VARIABLES
<a name="SPECIAL VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
names have special meaning to Perl. Most punctuation names
have reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the shells.
Nevertheless, if you wish to use long variable names, you
need only say:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
English;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">at the top of
your program. This aliases all the short names to the long
names in the current package. Some even have medium names,
generally borrowed from <b>awk</b>. For more info, please
see English.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before you
continue, note the sort order for variables. In general, we
first list the variables in case-insensitive,
almost-lexigraphical order (ignoring the &quot;{&quot; or
&quot;^&quot; preceding words, as in &quot;${^UNICODE}&quot;
or $^T), although $_ and @_ move up to the top of the pile.
For variables with the same identifier, we list it in order
of scalar, array, hash, and bareword.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Note for Linux
and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl v5.16.0 perl
would emulate <small>POSIX</small> semantics on Linux
systems using LinuxThreads, a partial implementation of
<small>POSIX</small> Threads that has since been superseded
by the Native <small>POSIX</small> Thread Library (
<small>NPTL</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">LinuxThreads is
now obsolete on Linux, and caching &quot;getpid()&quot; like
this made embedding perl unnecessarily complex (since
you&rsquo;d have to manually update the value of $$), so now
$$ and &quot;getppid()&quot; will always return the same
values as the underlying C library.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until and
including the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD
thread semantics, which are POSIX-like.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">To see if your
system is affected by this discrepancy check if
&quot;getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep &minus;q
NPTL&quot; returns a false value. <small>NTPL</small>
threads preserve the <small>POSIX</small> semantics.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">On some (but
not all) operating systems assigning to $0 modifies the
argument area that the &quot;ps&quot; program sees. On some
platforms you may have to use special &quot;ps&quot; options
or a different &quot;ps&quot; to see the changes. Modifying
the $0 is more useful as a way of indicating the current
program state than it is for hiding the program you&rsquo;re
running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Note that there
are platform-specific limitations on the maximum length of
$0. In the most extreme case it may be limited to the space
occupied by the original $0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">In some
platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding, for
example space characters, after the modified name as shown
by &quot;ps&quot;. In some platforms this padding may extend
all the way to the original length of the argument area, no
matter what you do (this is the case for example with Linux
2.2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Note for
<small>BSD</small> users: setting $0 does not completely
remove &quot;perl&quot; from the <b>ps</b>(1) output. For
example, setting $0 to &quot;foobar&quot; may result in
&quot;perl: foobar (perl)&quot; (whether both the
&quot;perl: &quot; prefix and the &quot; (perl)&quot; suffix
are shown depends on your exact <small>BSD</small> variant
and version). This is an operating system feature, Perl
cannot help it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">In
multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that
any thread may modify its copy of the $0 and the change
becomes visible to <b>ps</b>(1) (assuming the operating
system plays along). Note that the view of $0 the other
threads have will not change since they have their own
copies of it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If the program
has been given to perl via the switches &quot;&minus;e&quot;
or &quot;&minus;E&quot;, $0 will contain the string
&quot;&minus;e&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">On Linux as of
perl v5.14.0 the legacy process name will be set with
prctl(2), in addition to altering the <small>POSIX</small>
name via &quot;argv[0]&quot; as perl has done since version
4.000. Now system utilities that read the legacy process
name such as ps, top and killall will recognize the name you
set when assigning to $0. The string you supply will be cut
off at 16 bytes, this is a limitation imposed by Linux.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Wide characters
are invalid in $0 values. For historical reasons, though,
Perl accepts them and encodes them to
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small> When this happens a
wide-character warning is triggered.</p>

glob that doesn&rsquo;t contain a code slot is equivalent to

described below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If your system

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Certain
internal hooks can be also set using the %SIG hash. The
routine indicated by $SIG{__WARN__} is called when a warning
message is about to be printed. The warning message is
passed as the first argument. The presence of a
&quot;__WARN__&quot; hook causes the ordinary printing of
warnings to &quot;STDERR&quot; to be suppressed. You can use
this to save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into
fatal errors, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">local
$SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] }; <br>
eval $proggie;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">As the 'IGNORE'
hook is not supported by &quot;__WARN__&quot;, its effect is
the same as using 'DEFAULT'. You can disable warnings using
the empty subroutine:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">local
$SIG{__WARN__} = sub {};</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">The routine
indicated by $SIG{__DIE__} is called when a fatal exception
is about to be thrown. The error message is passed as the
first argument. When a &quot;__DIE__&quot; hook routine
returns, the exception processing continues as it would have
in the absence of the hook, unless the hook routine itself
exits via a &quot;goto &amp;sub&quot;, a loop exit, or a
&quot;die()&quot;. The &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler is
explicitly disabled during the call, so that you can die
from a &quot;__DIE__&quot; handler. Similarly for
&quot;__WARN__&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">The
$SIG{__DIE__} hook is called even inside an
&quot;eval()&quot;. It was never intended to happen this
way, but an implementation glitch made this possible. This
used to be deprecated, as it allowed strange action at a
distance like rewriting a pending exception in $@. Plans to
rectify this have been scrapped, as users found that
rewriting a pending exception is actually a useful feature,
and not a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">The
$SIG{__DIE__} doesn&rsquo;t support 'IGNORE'; it has the
same effect as 'DEFAULT'.</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;__DIE__&quot;/&quot;__WARN__&quot;
handlers are very special in one respect: they may be called
to report (probable) errors found by the parser. In such a
case the parser may be in inconsistent state, so any attempt
to evaluate Perl code from such a handler will probably
result in a segfault. This means that warnings or errors
that result from parsing Perl should be used with extreme
caution, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">require Carp if
defined $^S; <br>
Carp::confess(&quot;Something wrong&quot;) if defined
&amp;Carp::confess; <br>
die &quot;Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give
&quot; <br>
. &quot;backtrace...\n\t&quot; <br>
. &quot;To see backtrace try starting Perl with &minus;MCarp
switch&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Here the first
line will load &quot;Carp&quot; <i>unless</i> it is the
parser who called the handler. The second line will print
backtrace and die if &quot;Carp&quot; was available. The
third line will be executed only if &quot;Carp&quot; was not
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Having to even
think about the $^S variable in your exception handlers is
simply wrong. $SIG{__DIE__} as currently implemented invites
grievous and difficult to track down errors. Avoid it and
use an &quot;END{}&quot; or CORE::GLOBAL::die override
instead.</p>

Most of the special variables related to regular expressions
are side effects. Perl sets these variables when it has a
successful match, so you should check the match result
before using them. For instance:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if(
/P(A)TT(ER)N/ ) { <br>
print &quot;I found $1 and $2\n&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These variables
are read-only and dynamically-scoped, unless we note
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The dynamic
nature of the regular expression variables means that their
value is limited to the block that they are in, as
demonstrated by this bit of code:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $outer =
'Wallace and Grommit'; <br>
my $inner = 'Mutt and Jeff'; <br>
my $pattern = qr/(\S+) and (\S+)/; <br>
sub show_n { print &quot;\$1 is $1; \$2 is $2\n&quot; } <br>
{ <br>
OUTER: <br>
show_n() if $outer =~ m/$pattern/; <br>
INNER: { <br>
show_n() if $inner =~ m/$pattern/; <br>
} <br>
show_n(); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output
shows that while in the &quot;OUTER&quot; block, the values
of $1 and $2 are from the match against $outer. Inside the
&quot;INNER&quot; block, the values of $1 and $2 are from
the match against $inner, but only until the end of the
block (i.e. the dynamic scope). After the &quot;INNER&quot;
block completes, the values of $1 and $2 return to the
values for the match against $outer even though we have not
made another match:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$1 is Wallace;
$2 is Grommit <br>
$1 is Mutt; $2 is Jeff <br>
$1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Performance
issues</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Traditionally
in Perl, any use of any of the three variables
&quot;$`&quot;, $&amp; or &quot;$'&quot; (or their &quot;use
English&quot; equivalents) anywhere in the code, caused all
subsequent successful pattern matches to make a copy of the
matched string, in case the code might subsequently access
one of those variables. This imposed a considerable
performance penalty across the whole program, so generally
the use of these variables has been discouraged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.6.0
the &quot;@&minus;&quot; and &quot;@+&quot; dynamic arrays
were introduced that supply the indices of successful
matches. So you could for example do this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$str =~
/pattern/; <br>
print $`, $&amp;, $'; # bad: performance hit <br>
print # good: no performance hit <br>
substr($str, 0, $&minus;[0]), <br>
substr($str, $&minus;[0], $+[0]&minus;$&minus;[0]), <br>
substr($str, $+[0]);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.10.0
the &quot;/p&quot; match operator flag and the
&quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;, &quot;${^MATCH}&quot;, and
&quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot; variables were introduced, that
allowed you to suffer the penalties only on patterns marked
with &quot;/p&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.18.0
onwards, perl started noting the presence of each of the
three variables separately, and only copied that part of the
string required; so in</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$`; $&amp;;
&quot;abcdefgh&quot; =~ /d/</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl would only
copy the &quot;abcd&quot; part of the string. That could
make a big difference in something like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$str = 'x' x
1_000_000; <br>
$&amp;; # whoops <br>
$str =~ /x/g # one char copied a million times, not a
million chars</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.20.0
a new copy-on-write system was enabled by default, which
finally fixes all performance issues with these three
variables, and makes them safe to use anywhere.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Devel::NYTProf&quot; and
&quot;Devel::FindAmpersand&quot; modules can help you find
uses of these problematic match variables in your code. <br>

conserve the most memory. Under normal situations this

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Variables
related to filehandles</b> <br>
Variables that depend on the currently selected filehandle
may be set by calling an appropriate object method on the
&quot;IO::Handle&quot; object, although this is less
efficient than using the regular built-in variables.
(Summary lines below for this contain the word
<small>HANDLE.</small> ) First you must say</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
IO::Handle;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">after which you
may use either</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">method HANDLE
EXPR</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or more
safely,</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HANDLE&minus;&gt;method(EXPR)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each method
returns the old value of the &quot;IO::Handle&quot;
attribute. The methods each take an optional
<small>EXPR,</small> which, if supplied, specifies the new
value for the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; attribute in question.
If not supplied, most methods do nothing to the current
value--except for &quot;autoflush()&quot;, which will assume
a 1 for you, just to be different.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because loading
in the &quot;IO::Handle&quot; class is an expensive
operation, you should learn how to use the regular built-in
variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A few of these
variables are considered &quot;read-only&quot;. This means
that if you try to assign to this variable, either directly
or indirectly through a reference, you&rsquo;ll raise a
run-time exception.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You should be
very careful when modifying the default values of most
special variables described in this document. In most cases
you want to localize these variables before changing them,
since if you don&rsquo;t, the change may affect other
modules which rely on the default values of the special
variables that you have changed. This is one of the correct
ways to read the whole file at once:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open my $fh,
&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!; <br>
local $/; # enable localized slurp mode <br>
my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;; <br>
close $fh;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But the
following code is quite bad:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open my $fh,
&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!; <br>
undef $/; # enable slurp mode <br>
my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;; <br>
close $fh;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">since some
other module, may want to read data from some file in the
default &quot;line mode&quot;, so if the code we have just
presented has been executed, the global value of $/ is now
changed for any other code running inside the same Perl
interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Usually when a
variable is localized you want to make sure that this change
affects the shortest scope possible. So unless you are
already inside some short &quot;{}&quot; block, you should
create one yourself. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $content =
''; <br>
open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
<br>
{ <br>
local $/; <br>
$content = &lt;$fh&gt;; <br>
} <br>
close $fh;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
example of how your own code can go broken:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">for ( 1..3 ){
<br>
$\ = &quot;\r\n&quot;; <br>
nasty_break(); <br>
print &quot;$_&quot;; <br>
} <br>
sub nasty_break { <br>
$\ = &quot;\f&quot;; <br>
# do something with $_ <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You probably
expect this code to print the equivalent of</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but instead you
get:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;1\f2\f3\f&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Why? Because
&quot;nasty_break()&quot; modifies &quot;$\&quot; without
localizing it first. The value you set in
&quot;nasty_break()&quot; is still there when you return.
The fix is to add &quot;local()&quot; so the value
doesn&rsquo;t leak out of &quot;nasty_break()&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">local $\ =
&quot;\f&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s easy
to notice the problem in such a short example, but in more
complicated code you are looking for trouble if you
don&rsquo;t localize changes to the special variables.</p>

in Perl counts the number of lines that have been read from
it. (Depending on the value of $/, Perl&rsquo;s idea of what
constitutes a line may not match yours.) When a line is read
from a filehandle (via &quot;readline()&quot; or
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;), or when &quot;tell()&quot; or
&quot;seek()&quot; is called on it, $. becomes an alias to
the line counter for that filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">You can adjust
the counter by assigning to $., but this will not actually
move the seek pointer. <i>Localizing $. will not localize
the filehandle&rsquo;s line count</i>. Instead, it will
localize perl&rsquo;s notion of which filehandle $. is
currently aliased to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$. is reset
when the filehandle is closed, but <b>not</b> when an open
filehandle is reopened without an intervening
&quot;close()&quot;. For more details, see &quot;I/O
Operators&quot; in perlop. Because &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;
never does an explicit close, line numbers increase across
&quot;ARGV&quot; files (but see examples in &quot;eof&quot;
in perlfunc).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use &quot;HANDLE&minus;&gt;input_line_number(EXPR)&quot; to

<p>The input record separator, newline by default. This

Works like <b>awk</b>&rsquo;s <small>RS</small> variable,
including treating empty lines as a terminator if set to the
null string (an empty line cannot contain any spaces or
tabs). You may set it to a multi-character string to match a
multi-character terminator, or to &quot;undef&quot; to read
through the end of file. Setting it to &quot;\n\n&quot;
means something slightly different than setting to
&quot;&quot;, if the file contains consecutive empty lines.
Setting to &quot;&quot; will treat two or more consecutive
empty lines as a single empty line. Setting to
&quot;\n\n&quot; will blindly assume that the next input
character belongs to the next paragraph, even if it&rsquo;s
a newline.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Setting $/ to
an empty string -- the so-called <i>paragraph mode</i> --
merits special attention. When $/ is set to &quot;&quot; and
the entire file is read in with that setting, any sequence
of one or more consecutive newlines at the beginning of the
file is discarded. With the exception of the final record in
the file, each sequence of characters ending in two or more
newlines is treated as one record and is read in to end in
exactly two newlines. If the last record in the file ends in
zero or one consecutive newlines, that record is read in
with that number of newlines. If the last record ends in two
or more consecutive newlines, it is read in with two
newlines like all preceding records.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Setting $/ to a
reference to an integer, scalar containing an integer, or
scalar that&rsquo;s convertible to an integer will attempt
to read records instead of lines, with the maximum record
size being the referenced integer number of characters. So
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">local $/ =
\32768; # or \&quot;32768&quot;, or \$var_containing_32768

you&rsquo;re not reading from a record-oriented file (or
your <small>OS</small> doesn&rsquo;t have record-oriented
files), then you&rsquo;ll likely get a full chunk of data
with every read. If a record is larger than the record size
you&rsquo;ve set, you&rsquo;ll get the record back in
pieces. Trying to set the record size to zero or less is
deprecated and will cause $/ to have the value of
&quot;undef&quot;, which will cause reading in the (rest of
the) whole file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">As of 5.19.9
setting $/ to any other form of reference will throw a fatal
exception. This is in preparation for supporting new ways to
set $/ in the future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Error
Variables</b> <br>
The variables $@, $!, $^E, and $? contain information about
different types of error conditions that may appear during
execution of a Perl program. The variables are shown ordered
by the &quot;distance&quot; between the subsystem which
reported the error and the Perl process. They correspond to
errors detected by the Perl interpreter, C library,
operating system, or an external program, respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To illustrate
the differences between these variables, consider the
following Perl expression, which uses a single-quoted
string. After execution of this statement, perl may have set
all four special error variables:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">eval q{ <br>
open my $pipe, &quot;/cdrom/install |&quot; or die $!; <br>
my @res = &lt;$pipe&gt;; <br>
close $pipe or die &quot;bad pipe: $?, $!&quot;; <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When perl
executes the &quot;eval()&quot; expression, it translates
the &quot;open()&quot;, &quot;&lt;PIPE&gt;&quot;, and
&quot;close&quot; calls in the C run-time library and thence
to the operating system kernel. perl sets $! to the C
library&rsquo;s &quot;errno&quot; if one of these calls
fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$@ is set if
the string to be &quot;eval&quot;&minus;ed did not compile
(this may happen if &quot;open&quot; or &quot;close&quot;
were imported with bad prototypes), or if Perl code executed
during evaluation &quot;die()&quot;d. In these cases the
value of $@ is the compile error, or the argument to
&quot;die&quot; (which will interpolate $! and $?). (See
also Fatal, though.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Under a few
operating systems, $^E may contain a more verbose error
indicator, such as in this case, &quot; <small>CDROM</small>
tray not closed.&quot; Systems that do not support extended
error messages leave $^E the same as $!.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, $? may
be set to a non&minus;0 value if the external program
<i>/cdrom/install</i> fails. The upper eight bits reflect
specific error conditions encountered by the program (the
program&rsquo;s &quot;exit()&quot; value). The lower eight
bits reflect mode of failure, like signal death and core
dump information. See <b>wait</b>(2) for details. In
contrast to $! and $^E, which are set only if an error
condition is detected, the variable $? is set on each
&quot;wait&quot; or pipe &quot;close&quot;, overwriting the
old value. This is more like $@, which on every
&quot;eval()&quot; is always set on failure and cleared on
success.</p>

details, see the individual descriptions at $@, $!, $^E, and
$?. <br>

with the <small>WIFEXITED, WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNALED,
WTERMSIG, WIFSTOPPED,</small> and <small>WSTOPSIG</small>
functions provided by the <small>POSIX</small> module.</p>

via &quot;(caller($level))[8]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">When perl
begins to parse any block construct that provides a lexical
scope (e.g., eval body, required file, subroutine body, loop
body, or conditional block), the existing value of $^H is
saved, but its value is left unchanged. When the compilation
of the block is completed, it regains the saved value.
Between the points where its value is saved and restored,
code that executes within <small>BEGIN</small> blocks is
free to change the value of $^H.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">This behavior
provides the semantic of lexical scoping, and is used in,
for instance, the &quot;use strict&quot; pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">The contents
should be an integer; different bits of it are used for
different pragmatic flags. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">sub add_100 {
$^H |= 0x100 } <br>
sub foo { <br>
BEGIN { add_100() } <br>
bar&minus;&gt;baz($boon); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Consider what
happens during execution of the <small>BEGIN</small> block.
At this point the <small>BEGIN</small> block has already
been compiled, but the body of &quot;foo()&quot; is still
being compiled. The new value of $^H will therefore be
visible only while the body of &quot;foo()&quot; is being
compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Substitution of
&quot;BEGIN { add_100() }&quot; block with:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">When putting
items into &quot;%^H&quot;, in order to avoid conflicting

which keys to use. A module should use only keys that begin

<p style="margin-left:11%;">${^OPEN}</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">An internal variable used by

it opens &quot;STDIN&quot;). If this variable is not set,
these functions will set the default layers as described in

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;open()&quot;
ignores this variable (and the default layers) when called
