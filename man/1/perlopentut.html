Perl</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whenever you do
I/O on a file in Perl, you do so through what in Perl is
called a <b>filehandle</b>. A filehandle is an internal name
for an external file. It is the job of the &quot;open&quot;
function to make the association between the internal name
and the external name, and it is the job of the
&quot;close&quot; function to break that association.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For your
convenience, Perl sets up a few special filehandles that are
already open when you run. These include &quot;STDIN&quot;,
&quot;STDOUT&quot;, &quot;STDERR&quot;, and
&quot;ARGV&quot;. Since those are pre-opened, you can use
them right away without having to go to the trouble of
opening them yourself:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print STDERR
&quot;This is a debugging message.\n&quot;; <br>
print STDOUT &quot;Please enter something: &quot;; <br>
$response = &lt;STDIN&gt; // die &quot;how come no
input?&quot;; <br>
print STDOUT &quot;Thank you!\n&quot;; <br>
while (&lt;ARGV&gt;) { ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As you see from
those examples, &quot;STDOUT&quot; and &quot;STDERR&quot;
are output handles, and &quot;STDIN&quot; and
&quot;ARGV&quot; are input handles. They are in all capital
letters because they are reserved to Perl, much like the
@ARGV array and the %ENV hash are. Their external
associations were set up by your shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You will need
to open every other filehandle on your own. Although there
are many variants, the most common way to call Perl&rsquo;s
<b>open()</b> function is with three arguments and one
return value:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;
<i>OK</i> = open(<i>HANDLE</i>, <i>MODE</i>,
<i>PATHNAME</i>)&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Where:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><i><small>OK</small></i></p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p>will be some defined value if the open succeeds, but
&quot;undef&quot; if it fails;</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i><small>HANDLE</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">should be an undefined scalar
variable to be filled in by the &quot;open&quot; function if
it succeeds;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i><small>MODE</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is the access mode and the
encoding format to open the file with;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><i><small>PATHNAME</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">is the external name of the
file you want opened.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most of the
complexity of the &quot;open&quot; function lies in the many
possible values that the <i><small>MODE</small></i>
parameter can take on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One last thing
before we show you how to open files: opening files does not
(usually) automatically lock them in Perl. See perlfaq5 for
how to lock.</p>

<h2>Opening Text Files
<a name="Opening Text Files"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Opening Text
Files for Reading</b> <br>
If you want to read from a text file, first open it in
read-only mode like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $filename =
&quot;/some/path/to/a/textfile/goes/here&quot;; <br>
my $encoding = &quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)&quot;; <br>
my $handle = undef; # this will be filled in on success <br>
open($handle, &quot;&lt; $encoding&quot;, $filename) <br>
|| die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for reading:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As with the
shell, in Perl the &quot;&lt;&quot; is used to open the file
in read-only mode. If it succeeds, Perl allocates a brand
new filehandle for you and fills in your previously
undefined $handle argument with a reference to that
handle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now you may use
functions like &quot;readline&quot;, &quot;read&quot;,
&quot;getc&quot;, and &quot;sysread&quot; on that handle.
Probably the most common input function is the one that
looks like an operator:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$line =
readline($handle); <br>
$line = &lt;$handle&gt;; # same thing</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
&quot;readline&quot; function returns &quot;undef&quot; at
end of file or upon error, you will sometimes see it used
this way:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$line =
&lt;$handle&gt;; <br>
if (defined $line) { <br>
# do something with $line <br>
} <br>
else { <br>
# $line is not valid, so skip it <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
just quickly &quot;die&quot; on an undefined value this
way:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$line =
&lt;$handle&gt; // die &quot;no input found&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, if
hitting <small>EOF</small> is an expected and normal event,
you do not want to exit simply because you have run out of
input. Instead, you probably just want to exit an input
loop. You can then test to see if an actual error has caused
the loop to terminate, and act accordingly:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">while
(&lt;$handle&gt;) { <br>
# do something with data in $_ <br>
} <br>
if ($!) { <br>
die &quot;unexpected error while reading from $filename:
$!&quot;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>A Note on
Encodings</b>: Having to specify the text encoding every
time might seem a bit of a bother. To set up a default
encoding for &quot;open&quot; so that you don&rsquo;t have
to supply it each time, you can use the &quot;open&quot;
pragma:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use open qw&lt;
:encoding(UTF&minus;8) &gt;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once
you&rsquo;ve done that, you can safely omit the encoding
part of the open mode:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open($handle,
&quot;&lt;&quot;, $filename) <br>
|| die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for reading:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But never use
the bare &quot;&lt;&quot; without having set up a default
encoding first. Otherwise, Perl cannot know which of the
many, many, many possible flavors of text file you have, and
Perl will have no idea how to correctly map the data in your
file into actual characters it can work with. Other common
encoding formats including &quot;ASCII&quot;,
&quot;ISO&minus;8859&minus;1&quot;,
&quot;ISO&minus;8859&minus;15&quot;,
&quot;Windows&minus;1252&quot;, &quot;MacRoman&quot;, and
even &quot;UTF&minus;16LE&quot;. See perlunitut for more
about encodings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Opening Text
Files for Writing</b> <br>
When you want to write to a file, you first have to decide
what to do about any existing contents of that file. You
have two basic choices here: to preserve or to clobber.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
preserve any existing contents, then you want to open the
file in append mode. As in the shell, in Perl you use
&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; to open an existing file in append
mode. &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; creates the file if it does not
already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $handle =
undef; <br>
my $filename =
&quot;/some/path/to/a/textfile/goes/here&quot;; <br>
my $encoding = &quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)&quot;; <br>
open($handle, &quot;&gt;&gt; $encoding&quot;, $filename)
<br>
|| die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for appending:
$!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now you can
write to that filehandle using any of &quot;print&quot;,
&quot;printf&quot;, &quot;say&quot;, &quot;write&quot;, or
&quot;syswrite&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As noted above,
if the file does not already exist, then the append-mode
open will create it for you. But if the file does already
exist, its contents are safe from harm because you will be
adding your new text past the end of the old text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, sometimes you want to clobber whatever might already
be there. To empty out a file before you start writing to
it, you can open it in write-only mode:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $handle =
undef; <br>
my $filename =
&quot;/some/path/to/a/textfile/goes/here&quot;; <br>
my $encoding = &quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)&quot;; <br>
open($handle, &quot;&gt; $encoding&quot;, $filename) <br>
|| die &quot;$0: can't open $filename in write&minus;open
mode: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here again Perl
works just like the shell in that the &quot;&gt;&quot;
clobbers an existing file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As with the
append mode, when you open a file in write-only mode, you
can now write to that filehandle using any of
&quot;print&quot;, &quot;printf&quot;, &quot;say&quot;,
&quot;write&quot;, or &quot;syswrite&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What about
read-write mode? You should probably pretend it
doesn&rsquo;t exist, because opening text files in
read-write mode is unlikely to do what you would like. See
perlfaq5 for details.</p>

<h2>Opening Binary Files
<a name="Opening Binary Files"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the file to
be opened contains binary data instead of text characters,
then the &quot;MODE&quot; argument to &quot;open&quot; is a
little different. Instead of specifying the encoding, you
tell Perl that your data are in raw bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $filename =
&quot;/some/path/to/a/binary/file/goes/here&quot;; <br>
my $encoding = &quot;:raw :bytes&quot; <br>
my $handle = undef; # this will be filled in on success</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And then open
as before, choosing &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;,
or &quot;&gt;&quot; as needed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open($handle,
&quot;&lt; $encoding&quot;, $filename) <br>
|| die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for reading: $!&quot;;
<br>
open($handle, &quot;&gt;&gt; $encoding&quot;, $filename)
<br>
|| die &quot;$0: can't open $filename for appending:
$!&quot;; <br>
open($handle, &quot;&gt; $encoding&quot;, $filename) <br>
|| die &quot;$0: can't open $filename in write&minus;open
mode: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternately,
you can change to binary mode on an existing handle this
way:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">binmode($handle)
|| die &quot;cannot binmode handle&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
especially handy for the handles that Perl has already
opened for you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">binmode(STDIN)
|| die &quot;cannot binmode STDIN&quot;; <br>
binmode(STDOUT) || die &quot;cannot binmode
STDOUT&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
pass &quot;binmode&quot; an explicit encoding to change it
on the fly. This isn&rsquo;t exactly &quot;binary&quot;
mode, but we still use &quot;binmode&quot; to do it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">binmode(STDIN,
&quot;:encoding(MacRoman)&quot;) || die &quot;cannot binmode
STDIN&quot;; <br>
binmode(STDOUT, &quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;8)&quot;) || die
&quot;cannot binmode STDOUT&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once you have
your binary file properly opened in the right mode, you can
use all the same Perl I/O functions as you used on text
files. However, you may wish to use the fixed-size
&quot;read&quot; instead of the variable-sized
&quot;readline&quot; for your input.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s an
example of how to copy a binary file:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $BUFSIZ = 64
* (2 ** 10); <br>
my $name_in = &quot;/some/input/file&quot;; <br>
my $name_out = &quot;/some/output/flie&quot;; <br>
my($in_fh, $out_fh, $buffer); <br>
open($in_fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $name_in) <br>
|| die &quot;$0: cannot open $name_in for reading: $!&quot;;
<br>
open($out_fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, $name_out) <br>
|| die &quot;$0: cannot open $name_out for writing:
$!&quot;; <br>
for my $fh ($in_fh, $out_fh) { <br>
binmode($fh) || die &quot;binmode failed&quot;; <br>
} <br>
while (read($in_fh, $buffer, $BUFSIZ)) { <br>
unless (print $out_fh $buffer) { <br>
die &quot;couldn't write to $name_out: $!&quot;; <br>
} <br>
} <br>
close($in_fh) || die &quot;couldn't close $name_in:
$!&quot;; <br>
close($out_fh) || die &quot;couldn't close $name_out:
$!&quot;;</p>

<h2>Opening Pipes
<a name="Opening Pipes"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl also lets
you open a filehandle into an external program or shell
command rather than into a file. You can do this in order to
pass data from your Perl program to an external command for
further processing, or to receive data from another program
for your own Perl program to process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Filehandles
into commands are also known as <i>pipes</i>, since they
work on similar inter-process communication principles as
Unix pipelines. Such a filehandle has an active program
instead of a static file on its external end, but in every
other sense it works just like a more typical file-based
filehandle, with all the techniques discussed earlier in
this article just as applicable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As such, you
open a pipe using the same &quot;open&quot; call that you
use for opening files, setting the second (&quot;MODE&quot;)
argument to special characters that indicate either an input
or an output pipe. Use &quot;&minus;|&quot; for a filehandle
that will let your Perl program read data from an external
program, and &quot;|&minus;&quot; for a filehandle that will
send data to that program instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Opening a
pipe for reading</b> <br>
Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;d like your Perl program to
process data stored in a nearby directory called
&quot;unsorted&quot;, which contains a number of textfiles.
You&rsquo;d also like your program to sort all the contents
from these files into a single, alphabetically sorted list
of unique lines before it starts processing them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You could do
this through opening an ordinary filehandle into each of
those files, gradually building up an in-memory array of all
the file contents you load this way, and finally sorting and
filtering that array when you&rsquo;ve run out of files to
load. <i>Or</i>, you could offload all that merging and
sorting into your operating system&rsquo;s own
&quot;sort&quot; command by opening a pipe directly into its
output, and get to work that much faster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
how that might look:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open(my
$sort_fh, '&minus;|', 'sort &minus;u unsorted/*.txt') <br>
or die &quot;Couldn't open a pipe into sort: $!&quot;; <br>
# And right away, we can start reading sorted lines: <br>
while (my $line = &lt;$sort_fh&gt;) { <br>
# <br>
# ... Do something interesting with each $line here ... <br>
# <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
argument to &quot;open&quot;, &quot;&minus;|&quot;, makes it
a read-pipe into a separate program, rather than an ordinary
filehandle into a file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
third argument to &quot;open&quot; is a string containing
the program name (&quot;sort&quot;) plus all its arguments:
in this case, &quot;&minus;u&quot; to specify unqiue sort,
and then a fileglob specifying the files to sort. The
resulting filehandle $sort_fh works just like a read-only
(&quot;&lt;&quot;) filehandle, and your program can
subsequently read data from it as if it were opened onto an
ordinary, single file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Opening a
pipe for writing</b> <br>
Continuing the previous example, let&rsquo;s say that your
program has completed its processing, and the results sit in
an array called @processed. You want to print these lines to
a file called &quot;numbered.txt&quot; with a neatly
formatted column of line-numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certainly you
could write your own code to do this X or, once again, you
could kick that work over to another program. In this case,
&quot;cat&quot;, running with its own &quot;&minus;n&quot;
option to activate line numbering, should do the trick:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open(my
$cat_fh, '|&minus;', 'cat &minus;n &gt; numbered.txt') <br>
or die &quot;Couldn't open a pipe into cat: $!&quot;; <br>
for my $line (@processed) { <br>
print $cat_fh $line; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here, we use a
second &quot;open&quot; argument of &quot;|&minus;&quot;,
signifying that the filehandle assigned to $cat_fh should be
a write-pipe. We can then use it just as we would a
write-only ordinary filehandle, including the basic function
of &quot;print&quot;&minus;ing data to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
third argument, specifying the command that we wish to pipe
to, sets up &quot;cat&quot; to redirect its output via that
&quot;&gt;&quot; symbol into the file
&quot;numbered.txt&quot;. This can start to look a little
tricky, because that same symbol would have meant something
entirely different had it showed it in the second argument
to &quot;open&quot;! But here in the third argument,
it&rsquo;s simply part of the shell command that Perl will
open the pipe into, and Perl itself doesn&rsquo;t invest any
special meaning to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Expressing
the command as a list</b> <br>
For opening pipes, Perl offers the option to call
&quot;open&quot; with a list comprising the desired command
and all its own arguments as separate elements, rather than
combining them into a single string as in the examples
above. For instance, we could have phrased the
&quot;open&quot; call in the first example like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">open(my
$sort_fh, '&minus;|', 'sort', '&minus;u',
glob('unsorted/*.txt')) <br>
or die &quot;Couldn't open a pipe into sort: $!&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you call
&quot;open&quot; this way, Perl invokes the given command
directly, bypassing the shell. As such, the shell
won&rsquo;t try to interpret any special characters within
the command&rsquo;s argument list, which might overwise have
unwanted effects. This can make for safer, less error-prone
&quot;open&quot; calls, useful in cases such as passing in
variables as arguments, or even just referring to filenames
with spaces in them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, when
you <i>do</i> want to pass a meaningful metacharacter to the
shell, such with the &quot;*&quot; inside that final
&quot;unsorted/*.txt&quot; argument here, you can&rsquo;t
use this alternate syntax. In this case, we have worked
around it via Perl&rsquo;s handy &quot;glob&quot; built-in
function, which evaluates its argument into a list of
filenames X and we can safely pass that resulting list right
into &quot;open&quot;, as shown above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note also that
representing piped-command arguments in list form like this
doesn&rsquo;t work on every platform. It will work on any
Unix-based <small>OS</small> that provides a real
&quot;fork&quot; function (e.g. macOS or Linux), as well as
on Windows when running Perl 5.22 or later.</p>
