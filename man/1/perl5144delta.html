<h2>NAME

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl5144delta
&minus; what is new for perl v5.14.4</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes differences between the 5.14.3 release and the
5.14.4 release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0
and 5.14.0.</p>

<h2>Core Enhancements
<a name="Core Enhancements"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No changes
since 5.14.0.</p>

<h2>Security
<a name="Security"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This release
contains one major, and medium, and a number of minor
security fixes. The latter are included mainly to allow the
test suite to pass cleanly with the clang compiler&rsquo;s
address sanitizer facility.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>CVE&minus;2013&minus;1667:</small>
memory exhaustion with arbitrary hash keys</b> <br>
With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example
arguments on a <small>URL</small> ), it is possible to cause
a hash to consume a large amount of memory and
<small>CPU,</small> and thus possibly to achieve a
Denial-of-Service.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>memory leak
in Encode</b> <br>
The <small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoding implementation in
Encode.xs had a memory leak which has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>[perl
#111594] Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un heap-buffer-overflow</b>
<br>
A read buffer overflow could occur when copying
&quot;sockaddr&quot; buffers. Fairly harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>[perl
#111586] SDBM_File: fix off-by-one access to global
&quot;.dir&quot;</b> <br>
An extra byte was being copied for some string literals.
Fairly harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>off-by-two
error in List::Util</b> <br>
A string literal was being used that included two bytes
beyond the end of the string. Fairly harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>[perl
#115994] fix segv in regcomp.c:S_join_exact()</b> <br>
Under debugging builds, while marking optimised-out regex
nodes as type &quot;OPTIMIZED&quot;, it could treat blocks
of exact text as if they were nodes, and thus
<small>SEGV.</small> Fairly harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>[perl
#115992] PL_eval_start use-after-free</b> <br>
The statement &quot;local $[;&quot;, when preceded by an
&quot;eval&quot;, and when not part of an assignment, could
crash. Fairly harmless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
has been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>wrap-around
with <small>IO</small> on long strings</b> <br>
Reading or writing strings greater than 2**31 bytes in size
could segfault due to integer wraparound.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This problem
has been fixed.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.14.4
represents approximately 5 months of development since Perl
5.14.3 and contains approximately 1,700 lines of changes
across 49 files from 12 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl continues
to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are
known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl
5.14.4:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Andy Dougherty,
Chris &rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo; Williams, Christian Hansen, Craig
A. Berry, Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves,
Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, Reini Urban, Ricardo
Signes, Yves Orton.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The list above
is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it
does not include the names of the (very much appreciated)
contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a more
complete list of all of Perl&rsquo;s historical
contributors, please see the <i><small>AUTHORS</small></i>
file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h2>Reporting Bugs
<a name="Reporting Bugs"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you find
what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the
perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may
also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home
Page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to
a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with
the output of &quot;perl &minus;V&quot;, will be sent off to
perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting
team.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the bug you
are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list,
then please send it to
perl5&minus;security&minus;report@perl.org. This points to a
closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who be able to help assess the
impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the
problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl
core, not for modules independently distributed on
<small>CPAN.</small></p>
