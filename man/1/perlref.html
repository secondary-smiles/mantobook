features, see perlreftut.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before release
5 of Perl it was difficult to represent complex data
structures, because all references had to be symbolic--and
even then it was difficult to refer to a variable instead of
a symbol table entry. Perl now not only makes it easier to
use symbolic references to variables, but also lets you have
&quot;hard&quot; references to any piece of data or code.
Any scalar may hold a hard reference. Because arrays and
hashes contain scalars, you can now easily build arrays of
arrays, arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, arrays of hashes
of functions, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hard references
are smart--they keep track of reference counts for you,
automatically freeing the thing referred to when its
reference count goes to zero. (Reference counts for values
in self-referential or cyclic data structures may not go to
zero without a little help; see &quot;Circular
References&quot; for a detailed explanation.) If that thing
happens to be an object, the object is destructed. See
perlobj for more about objects. (In a sense, everything in
Perl is an object, but we usually reserve the word for
references to objects that have been officially
&quot;blessed&quot; into a class package.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Symbolic
references are names of variables or other objects, just as
a symbolic link in a Unix filesystem contains merely the
name of a file. The *glob notation is something of a
symbolic reference. (Symbolic references are sometimes
called &quot;soft references&quot;, but please don&rsquo;t
call them that; references are confusing enough without
useless synonyms.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In contrast,
hard references are more like hard links in a Unix file
system: They are used to access an underlying object without
concern for what its (other) name is. When the word
&quot;reference&quot; is used without an adjective, as in
the following paragraph, it is usually talking about a hard
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">References are
easy to use in Perl. There is just one overriding principle:
in general, Perl does no implicit referencing or
dereferencing. When a scalar is holding a reference, it
always behaves as a simple scalar. It doesn&rsquo;t
magically start being an array or hash or subroutine; you
have to tell it explicitly to do so, by dereferencing
it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Making
References</b> <br>
References can be created in several ways.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Backslash
Operator</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By using the
backslash operator on a variable, subroutine, or value.
(This works much like the &amp; (address-of) operator in C.)
This typically creates <i>another</i> reference to a
variable, because there&rsquo;s already a reference to the
variable in the symbol table. But the symbol table reference
might go away, and you&rsquo;ll still have the reference
that the backslash returned. Here are some examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$scalarref =
\$foo; <br>
$arrayref = \@ARGV; <br>
$hashref = \%ENV; <br>
$coderef = \&amp;handler; <br>
$globref = \*foo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It isn&rsquo;t
possible to create a true reference to an <small>IO</small>
handle (filehandle or dirhandle) using the backslash
operator. The most you can get is a reference to a typeglob,
which is actually a complete symbol table entry. But see the
explanation of the *foo{THING} syntax below. However, you
can still use type globs and globrefs as though they were
<small>IO</small> handles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Square
Brackets</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A reference to
an anonymous array can be created using square brackets:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$arrayref = [1,
2, ['a', 'b', 'c']];</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here
we&rsquo;ve created a reference to an anonymous array of
three elements whose final element is itself a reference to
another anonymous array of three elements. (The
multidimensional syntax described later can be used to
access this. For example, after the above,
&quot;$arrayref&minus;&gt;[2][1]&quot; would have the value
&quot;b&quot;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Taking a
reference to an enumerated list is not the same as using
square brackets--instead it&rsquo;s the same as creating a
list of references!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@list = (\$a,
\@b, \%c); <br>
@list = \($a, @b, %c); # same thing!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case, &quot;\(@foo)&quot; returns a list of references to
the contents of @foo, not a reference to @foo itself.
Likewise for %foo, except that the key references are to
copies (since the keys are just strings rather than
full-fledged scalars).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Curly
Brackets</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A reference to
an anonymous hash can be created using curly brackets:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$hashref = {
<br>
'Adam' =&gt; 'Eve', <br>
'Clyde' =&gt; 'Bonnie', <br>
};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anonymous hash
and array composers like these can be intermixed freely to
produce as complicated a structure as you want. The
multidimensional syntax described below works for these too.
The values above are literals, but variables and expressions
would work just as well, because assignment operators in
Perl (even within <b>local()</b> or <b>my()</b>) are
executable statements, not compile-time declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because curly
brackets (braces) are used for several other things
including BLOCKs, you may occasionally have to disambiguate
braces at the beginning of a statement by putting a
&quot;+&quot; or a &quot;return&quot; in front so that Perl
realizes the opening brace isn&rsquo;t starting a
<small>BLOCK.</small> The economy and mnemonic value of
using curlies is deemed worth this occasional extra
hassle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you wanted a function to make a new hash and return a
reference to it, you have these options:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub hashem { {
@_ } } # silently wrong <br>
sub hashem { +{ @_ } } # ok <br>
sub hashem { return { @_ } } # ok</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, if you want the other meaning, you can do this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub showem { {
@_ } } # ambiguous (currently ok, <br>
# but may change) <br>
sub showem { {; @_ } } # ok <br>
sub showem { { return @_ } } # ok</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The leading
&quot;+{&quot; and &quot;{;&quot; always serve to
disambiguate the expression to mean either the
<small>HASH</small> reference, or the
<small>BLOCK.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Anonymous
Subroutines</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A reference to
an anonymous subroutine can be created by using
&quot;sub&quot; without a subname:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$coderef = sub
{ print &quot;Boink!\n&quot; };</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note the
semicolon. Except for the code inside not being immediately
executed, a &quot;sub {}&quot; is not so much a declaration
as it is an operator, like &quot;do{}&quot; or
&quot;eval{}&quot;. (However, no matter how many times you
execute that particular line (unless you&rsquo;re in an
&quot;eval(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;), $coderef will still have
a reference to the <i>same</i> anonymous subroutine.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anonymous
subroutines act as closures with respect to <b>my()</b>
variables, that is, variables lexically visible within the
current scope. Closure is a notion out of the Lisp world
that says if you define an anonymous function in a
particular lexical context, it pretends to run in that
context even when it&rsquo;s called outside the context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In human terms,
it&rsquo;s a funny way of passing arguments to a subroutine
when you define it as well as when you call it. It&rsquo;s
useful for setting up little bits of code to run later, such
as callbacks. You can even do object-oriented stuff with it,
though Perl already provides a different mechanism to do
that--see perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You might also
think of closure as a way to write a subroutine template
without using <b>eval()</b>. Here&rsquo;s a small example of
how closures work:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub newprint {
<br>
my $x = shift; <br>
return sub { my $y = shift; print &quot;$x, $y!\n&quot;; };
<br>
} <br>
$h = newprint(&quot;Howdy&quot;); <br>
$g = newprint(&quot;Greetings&quot;); <br>
# Time passes... <br>
&amp;$h(&quot;world&quot;); <br>
&amp;$g(&quot;earthlings&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This prints</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Howdy, world!
<br>
Greetings, earthlings!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note
particularly that $x continues to refer to the value passed
into <b>newprint()</b> <i>despite</i> &quot;my $x&quot;
having gone out of scope by the time the anonymous
subroutine runs. That&rsquo;s what a closure is all
about.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This applies
only to lexical variables, by the way. Dynamic variables
continue to work as they have always worked. Closure is not
something that most Perl programmers need trouble themselves
about to begin with.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Constructors</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">References are
often returned by special subroutines called constructors.
Perl objects are just references to a special type of object
that happens to know which package it&rsquo;s associated
with. Constructors are just special subroutines that know
how to create that association. They do so by starting with
an ordinary reference, and it remains an ordinary reference
even while it&rsquo;s also being an object. Constructors are
often named &quot;new()&quot;. You <i>can</i> call them
indirectly:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$objref = new
Doggie( Tail =&gt; 'short', Ears =&gt; 'long' );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">But that can
produce ambiguous syntax in certain cases, so it&rsquo;s
often better to use the direct method invocation
approach:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$objref =
Doggie&minus;&gt;new(Tail =&gt; 'short', Ears =&gt; 'long');
<br>
use Term::Cap; <br>
$terminal = Term::Cap&minus;&gt;Tgetent( { OSPEED =&gt; 9600
}); <br>
use Tk; <br>
$main = MainWindow&minus;&gt;new(); <br>
$menubar = $main&minus;&gt;Frame(&minus;relief =&gt;
&quot;raised&quot;, <br>
&minus;borderwidth =&gt; 2)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This indirect
object syntax is only available when &quot;use feature
&quot;indirect&quot;&quot; is in effect, and that is not the
case when &quot;use v5.36&quot; (or higher) is requested, it
is best to avoid indirect object syntax entirely.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Autovivification</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">References of
the appropriate type can spring into existence if you
dereference them in a context that assumes they exist.
Because we haven&rsquo;t talked about dereferencing yet, we
can&rsquo;t show you any examples yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Typeglob
Slots</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A reference can
be created by using a special syntax, lovingly known as the
*foo{ <small>THING</small> } syntax. *foo{
<small>THING</small> } returns a reference to the
<small>THING</small> slot in *foo (which is the symbol table
entry which holds everything known as foo).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$scalarref =
*foo{SCALAR}; <br>
$arrayref = *ARGV{ARRAY}; <br>
$hashref = *ENV{HASH}; <br>
$coderef = *handler{CODE}; <br>
$ioref = *STDIN{IO}; <br>
$globref = *foo{GLOB}; <br>
$formatref = *foo{FORMAT}; <br>
$globname = *foo{NAME}; # &quot;foo&quot; <br>
$pkgname = *foo{PACKAGE}; # &quot;main&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most of these
are self-explanatory, but *foo{IO} deserves special
attention. It returns the <small>IO</small> handle, used for
file handles (&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), sockets
(&quot;socket&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;socketpair&quot;
in perlfunc), and directory handles (&quot;opendir&quot; in
perlfunc). For compatibility with previous versions of Perl,
*foo{FILEHANDLE} is a synonym for *foo{IO}, though it is
discouraged, to encourage a consistent use of one name:
<small>IO.</small> On perls between v5.8 and v5.22, it will
issue a deprecation warning, but this deprecation has since
been rescinded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*foo{THING}
returns undef if that particular <small>THING</small>
hasn&rsquo;t been used yet, except in the case of scalars.
*foo{SCALAR} returns a reference to an anonymous scalar if
$foo hasn&rsquo;t been used yet. This might change in a
future release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*foo{NAME} and
*foo{PACKAGE} are the exception, in that they return
strings, rather than references. These return the package
and name of the typeglob itself, rather than one that has
been assigned to it. So, after &quot;*foo=*Foo::bar&quot;,
*foo will become &quot;*Foo::bar&quot; when used as a
string, but *foo{PACKAGE} and *foo{NAME} will continue to
produce &quot;main&quot; and &quot;foo&quot;,
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*foo{IO} is an
alternative to the *HANDLE mechanism given in
&quot;Typeglobs and Filehandles&quot; in perldata for
passing filehandles into or out of subroutines, or storing
into larger data structures. Its disadvantage is that it
won&rsquo;t create a new filehandle for you. Its advantage
is that you have less risk of clobbering more than you want
to with a typeglob assignment. (It still conflates file and
directory handles, though.) However, if you assign the
incoming value to a scalar instead of a typeglob as we do in
the examples below, there&rsquo;s no risk of that
happening.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">splutter(*STDOUT);
# pass the whole glob <br>
splutter(*STDOUT{IO}); # pass both file and dir handles <br>
sub splutter { <br>
my $fh = shift; <br>
print $fh &quot;her um well a hmmm\n&quot;; <br>
} <br>
$rec = get_rec(*STDIN); # pass the whole glob <br>
$rec = get_rec(*STDIN{IO}); # pass both file and dir handles
<br>
sub get_rec { <br>
my $fh = shift; <br>
return scalar &lt;$fh&gt;; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Using
References</b> <br>
That&rsquo;s it for creating references. By now you&rsquo;re
probably dying to know how to use references to get back to
your long-lost data. There are several basic methods.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Simple
Scalar</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anywhere
you&rsquo;d put an identifier (or chain of identifiers) as
part of a variable or subroutine name, you can replace the
identifier with a simple scalar variable containing a
reference of the correct type:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$bar =
$$scalarref; <br>
push(@$arrayref, $filename); <br>
$$arrayref[0] = &quot;January&quot;; <br>
$$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; <br>
&amp;$coderef(1,2,3); <br>
print $globref &quot;output\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It&rsquo;s
important to understand that we are specifically <i>not</i>
dereferencing $arrayref[0] or $hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}
there. The dereference of the scalar variable happens
<i>before</i> it does any key lookups. Anything more
complicated than a simple scalar variable must use methods 2
or 3 below. However, a &quot;simple scalar&quot; includes an
identifier that itself uses method 1 recursively. Therefore,
the following prints &quot;howdy&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$refrefref =
\\\&quot;howdy&quot;; <br>
print $$$$refrefref;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Block</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anywhere
you&rsquo;d put an identifier (or chain of identifiers) as
part of a variable or subroutine name, you can replace the
identifier with a <small>BLOCK</small> returning a reference
of the correct type. In other words, the previous examples
could be written like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$bar =
${$scalarref}; <br>
push(@{$arrayref}, $filename); <br>
${$arrayref}[0] = &quot;January&quot;; <br>
${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; <br>
&amp;{$coderef}(1,2,3); <br>
$globref&minus;&gt;print(&quot;output\n&quot;); # iff
IO::Handle is loaded</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Admittedly,
it&rsquo;s a little silly to use the curlies in this case,
but the <small>BLOCK</small> can contain any arbitrary
expression, in particular, subscripted expressions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&amp;{
$dispatch{$index} }(1,2,3); # call correct routine</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because of
being able to omit the curlies for the simple case of $$x,
people often make the mistake of viewing the dereferencing
symbols as proper operators, and wonder about their
precedence. If they were, though, you could use parentheses
instead of braces. That&rsquo;s not the case. Consider the
difference below; case 0 is a short-hand version of case 1,
<i>not</i> case 2:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}
= &quot;VALUE&quot;; # CASE 0 <br>
${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; # CASE 1
<br>
${$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; # CASE 2
<br>
${$hashref&minus;&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;
# CASE 3</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Case 2 is also
deceptive in that you&rsquo;re accessing a variable called
%hashref, not dereferencing through $hashref to the hash
it&rsquo;s presumably referencing. That would be case 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Arrow
Notation</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Subroutine
calls and lookups of individual array elements arise often
enough that it gets cumbersome to use method 2. As a form of
syntactic sugar, the examples for method 2 may be
written:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$arrayref&minus;&gt;[0]
= &quot;January&quot;; # Array element <br>
$hashref&minus;&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;; #
Hash element <br>
$coderef&minus;&gt;(1,2,3); # Subroutine call</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The left side
of the arrow can be any expression returning a reference,
including a previous dereference. Note that $array[$x] is
<i>not</i> the same thing as
&quot;$array&minus;&gt;[$x]&quot; here:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$array[$x]&minus;&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}&minus;&gt;[0]
= &quot;January&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is one of
the cases we mentioned earlier in which references could
spring into existence when in an lvalue context. Before this
statement, $array[$x] may have been undefined. If so,
it&rsquo;s automatically defined with a hash reference so
that we can look up &quot;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot; in it.
Likewise &quot;$array[$x]&minus;&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot;
will automatically get defined with an array reference so
that we can look up &quot;[0]&quot; in it. This process is
called <i>autovivification</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One more thing
here. The arrow is optional <i>between</i> brackets
subscripts, so you can shrink the above down to</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$array[$x]{&quot;foo&quot;}[0]
= &quot;January&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Which, in the
degenerate case of using only ordinary arrays, gives you
multidimensional arrays just like C&rsquo;s:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$score[$x][$y][$z]
+= 42;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Well, okay, not
entirely like C&rsquo;s arrays, actually. C doesn&rsquo;t
know how to grow its arrays on demand. Perl does.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Objects</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a reference
happens to be a reference to an object, then there are
probably methods to access the things referred to, and you
should probably stick to those methods unless you&rsquo;re
in the class package that defines the object&rsquo;s
methods. In other words, be nice, and don&rsquo;t violate
the object&rsquo;s encapsulation without a very good reason.
Perl does not enforce encapsulation. We are not
totalitarians here. We do expect some basic civility
though.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Miscellaneous
Usage</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using a string
or number as a reference produces a symbolic reference, as
explained above. Using a reference as a number produces an
integer representing its storage location in memory. The
only useful thing to be done with this is to compare two
references numerically to see whether they refer to the same
location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">if ($ref1 ==
$ref2) { # cheap numeric compare of references <br>
print &quot;refs 1 and 2 refer to the same thing\n&quot;;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using a
reference as a string produces both its referent&rsquo;s
type, including any package blessing as described in
perlobj, as well as the numeric address expressed in hex.
The <b>ref()</b> operator returns just the type of thing the
reference is pointing to, without the address. See
&quot;ref&quot; in perlfunc for details and examples of its
use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>bless()</b> operator may be used to associate the object
a reference points to with a package functioning as an
object class. See perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A typeglob may
be dereferenced the same way a reference can, because the
dereference syntax always indicates the type of reference
desired. So &quot;${*foo}&quot; and &quot;${\$foo}&quot;
both indicate the same scalar variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
trick for interpolating a subroutine call into a string:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print &quot;My
sub returned @{[mysub(1,2,3)]} that time.\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way it
works is that when the &quot;@{...}&quot; is seen in the
double-quoted string, it&rsquo;s evaluated as a block. The
block creates a reference to an anonymous array containing
the results of the call to &quot;mysub(1,2,3)&quot;. So the
whole block returns a reference to an array, which is then
dereferenced by &quot;@{...}&quot; and stuck into the
double-quoted string. This chicanery is also useful for
arbitrary expressions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print
&quot;That yields @{[$n + 5]} widgets\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, an
expression that returns a reference to a scalar can be
dereferenced via &quot;${...}&quot;. Thus, the above
expression may be written as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print
&quot;That yields ${\($n + 5)} widgets\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Circular
References</b> <br>
It is possible to create a &quot;circular reference&quot; in
Perl, which can lead to memory leaks. A circular reference
occurs when two references contain a reference to each
other, like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $foo = {};
<br>
my $bar = { foo =&gt; $foo }; <br>
$foo&minus;&gt;{bar} = $bar;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
create a circular reference with a single variable:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $foo; <br>
$foo = \$foo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this case,
the reference count for the variables will never reach 0,
and the references will never be garbage-collected. This can
lead to memory leaks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because objects
in Perl are implemented as references, it&rsquo;s possible
to have circular references with objects as well. Imagine a
TreeNode class where each node references its parent and
child nodes. Any node with a parent will be part of a
circular reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can break
circular references by creating a &quot;weak
reference&quot;. A weak reference does not increment the
reference count for a variable, which means that the object
can go out of scope and be destroyed. You can weaken a
reference with the &quot;weaken&quot; function exported by
the Scalar::Util module, or available as
&quot;builtin::weaken&quot; directly in Perl version 5.35.7
or later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s
how we can make the first example safer:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use
Scalar::Util 'weaken'; <br>
my $foo = {}; <br>
my $bar = { foo =&gt; $foo }; <br>
$foo&minus;&gt;{bar} = $bar; <br>
weaken $foo&minus;&gt;{bar};</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The reference
from $foo to $bar has been weakened. When the $bar variable
goes out of scope, it will be garbage-collected. The next
time you look at the value of the
&quot;$foo&minus;&gt;{bar}&quot; key, it will be
&quot;undef&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This action at
a distance can be confusing, so you should be careful with
your use of weaken. You should weaken the reference in the
variable that will go out of scope <i>first</i>. That way,
the longer-lived variable will contain the expected
reference until it goes out of scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Symbolic
references</b> <br>
We said that references spring into existence as necessary
if they are undefined, but we didn&rsquo;t say what happens
if a value used as a reference is already defined, but
<i>isn&rsquo;t</i> a hard reference. If you use it as a
reference, it&rsquo;ll be treated as a symbolic reference.
That is, the value of the scalar is taken to be the
<i>name</i> of a variable, rather than a direct link to a
(possibly) anonymous value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">People
frequently expect it to work like this. So it does.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$name =
&quot;foo&quot;; <br>
$$name = 1; # Sets $foo <br>
${$name} = 2; # Sets $foo <br>
${$name x 2} = 3; # Sets $foofoo <br>
$name&minus;&gt;[0] = 4; # Sets $foo[0] <br>
@$name = (); # Clears @foo <br>
&amp;$name(); # Calls &amp;foo() <br>
$pack = &quot;THAT&quot;; <br>
${&quot;${pack}::$name&quot;} = 5; # Sets $THAT::foo without
eval</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is
powerful, and slightly dangerous, in that it&rsquo;s
possible to intend (with the utmost sincerity) to use a hard
reference, and accidentally use a symbolic reference
instead. To protect against that, you can say</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use strict
'refs';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and then only
hard references will be allowed for the rest of the
enclosing block. An inner block may countermand that
with</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">no strict
'refs';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only package
variables (globals, even if localized) are visible to
symbolic references. Lexical variables (declared with
<b>my()</b>) aren&rsquo;t in a symbol table, and thus are
invisible to this mechanism. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">local $value =
10; <br>
$ref = &quot;value&quot;; <br>
{ <br>
my $value = 20; <br>
print $$ref; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will still
print 10, not 20. Remember that <b>local()</b> affects
package variables, which are all &quot;global&quot; to the
package.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Not-so-symbolic
references</b> <br>
Brackets around a symbolic reference can simply serve to
isolate an identifier or variable name from the rest of an
expression, just as they always have within a string. For
example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$push =
&quot;pop on &quot;; <br>
print &quot;${push}over&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">has always
meant to print &quot;pop on over&quot;, even though push is
a reserved word. This is generalized to work the same
without the enclosing double quotes, so that</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print ${push} .
&quot;over&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and even</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print ${ push }
. &quot;over&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will have the
same effect. This construct is <i>not</i> considered to be a
symbolic reference when you&rsquo;re using strict refs:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use strict
'refs'; <br>
${ bareword }; # Okay, means $bareword. <br>
${ &quot;bareword&quot; }; # Error, symbolic reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
because of all the subscripting that is done using single
words, the same rule applies to any bareword that is used
for subscripting a hash. So now, instead of writing</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$hash{
&quot;aaa&quot; }{ &quot;bbb&quot; }{ &quot;ccc&quot; }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">you can write
just</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$hash{ aaa }{
bbb }{ ccc }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and not worry
about whether the subscripts are reserved words. In the rare
event that you do wish to do something like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$hash{ shift
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">you can force
interpretation as a reserved word by adding anything that
makes it more than a bareword:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$hash{ shift()
} <br>
$hash{ +shift } <br>
$hash{ shift @_ }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The &quot;use
warnings&quot; pragma or the <b>&minus;w</b> switch will
warn you if it interprets a reserved word as a string. But
it will no longer warn you about using lowercase words,
because the string is effectively quoted.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pseudo-hashes:
Using an array as a hash</b> <br>
Pseudo-hashes have been removed from Perl. The
&rsquo;fields&rsquo; pragma remains available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Function
Templates</b> <br>
As explained above, an anonymous function with access to the
lexical variables visible when that function was compiled,
creates a closure. It retains access to those variables even
though it doesn&rsquo;t get run until later, such as in a
signal handler or a Tk callback.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using a closure
as a function template allows us to generate many functions
that act similarly. Suppose you wanted functions named after
the colors that generated <small>HTML</small> font changes
for the various colors:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print &quot;Be
&quot;, red(&quot;careful&quot;), &quot;with that &quot;,
green(&quot;light&quot;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>red()</b> and <b>green()</b> functions would be similar.
To create these, we&rsquo;ll assign a closure to a typeglob
of the name of the function we&rsquo;re trying to build.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@colors =
qw(red blue green yellow orange purple violet); <br>
for my $name (@colors) { <br>
no strict 'refs'; # allow symbol table manipulation <br>
*$name = *{uc $name} = sub { &quot;&lt;FONT
COLOR='$name'&gt;@_&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; }; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now all those
different functions appear to exist independently. You can
call <b>red()</b>, <b><small>RED</small> ()</b>,
<b>blue()</b>, <b><small>BLUE</small> ()</b>,
<b>green()</b>, etc. This technique saves on both compile
time and memory use, and is less error-prone as well, since
syntax checks happen at compile time. It&rsquo;s critical
that any variables in the anonymous subroutine be lexicals
in order to create a proper closure. That&rsquo;s the
reasons for the &quot;my&quot; on the loop iteration
variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is one of
the only places where giving a prototype to a closure makes
much sense. If you wanted to impose scalar context on the
arguments of these functions (probably not a wise idea for
this particular example), you could have written it this way
instead:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*$name = sub
($) { &quot;&lt;FONT
COLOR='$name'&gt;$_[0]&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, since
prototype checking happens at compile time, the assignment
above happens too late to be of much use. You could address
this by putting the whole loop of assignments within a
<small>BEGIN</small> block, forcing it to occur during
compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Access to
lexicals that change over time--like those in the
&quot;for&quot; loop above, basically aliases to elements
from the surrounding lexical scopes-- only works with
anonymous subs, not with named subroutines. Generally said,
named subroutines do not nest properly and should only be
declared in the main package scope.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is because
named subroutines are created at compile time so their
lexical variables get assigned to the parent lexicals from
the first execution of the parent block. If a parent scope
is entered a second time, its lexicals are created again,
while the nested subs still reference the old ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Anonymous
subroutines get to capture each time you execute the
&quot;sub&quot; operator, as they are created on the fly. If
you are accustomed to using nested subroutines in other
programming languages with their own private variables,
you&rsquo;ll have to work at it a bit in Perl. The intuitive
coding of this type of thing incurs mysterious warnings
about &quot;will not stay shared&quot; due to the reasons
explained above. For example, this won&rsquo;t work:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub outer {
<br>
my $x = $_[0] + 35; <br>
sub inner { return $x * 19 } # WRONG <br>
return $x + inner(); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A work-around
is the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub outer {
<br>
my $x = $_[0] + 35; <br>
local *inner = sub { return $x * 19 }; <br>
return $x + inner(); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now
<b>inner()</b> can only be called from within
<b>outer()</b>, because of the temporary assignments of the
anonymous subroutine. But when it does, it has normal access
to the lexical variable $x from the scope of <b>outer()</b>
at the time outer is invoked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This has the
interesting effect of creating a function local to another
function, something not normally supported in Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Postfix
Dereference Syntax</b> <br>
Beginning in v5.20.0, a postfix syntax for using references
is available. It behaves as described in &quot;Using
References&quot;, but instead of a prefixed sigil, a
postfixed sigil-and-star is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$r = \@a; <br>
@b = $r&minus;&gt;@*; # equivalent to @$r or @{ $r } <br>
$r = [ 1, [ 2, 3 ], 4 ]; <br>
$r&minus;&gt;[1]&minus;&gt;@*; # equivalent to @{
$r&minus;&gt;[1] }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.20
and 5.22, this syntax must be enabled with &quot;use feature
'postderef'&quot;. As of Perl 5.24, no feature declarations
are required to make it available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Postfix
dereference should work in all circumstances where block
(circumfix) dereference worked, and should be entirely
equivalent. This syntax allows dereferencing to be written
and read entirely left-to-right. The following equivalencies
are defined:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$sref&minus;&gt;$*;
# same as ${ $sref } <br>
$aref&minus;&gt;@*; # same as @{ $aref } <br>
$aref&minus;&gt;$#*; # same as $#{ $aref } <br>
$href&minus;&gt;%*; # same as %{ $href } <br>
$cref&minus;&gt;&amp;*; # same as &amp;{ $cref } <br>
$gref&minus;&gt;**; # same as *{ $gref }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note especially
that &quot;$cref&minus;&gt;&amp;*&quot; is <i>not</i>
equivalent to &quot;$cref&minus;&gt;()&quot;, and can serve
different purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Glob elements
can be extracted through the postfix dereferencing
feature:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$gref&minus;&gt;*{SCALAR};
# same as *{ $gref }{SCALAR}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Postfix array
and scalar dereferencing <i>can</i> be used in interpolating
strings (double quotes or the &quot;qq&quot; operator), but
only if the &quot;postderef_qq&quot; feature is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Postfix
Reference Slicing</b> <br>
Value slices of arrays and hashes may also be taken with
postfix dereferencing notation, with the following
equivalencies:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$aref&minus;&gt;@[
... ]; # same as @$aref[ ... ] <br>
$href&minus;&gt;@{ ... }; # same as @$href{ ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Postfix
key/value pair slicing, added in 5.20.0 and documented in
the Key/Value Hash Slices section of perldata, also behaves
as expected:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$aref&minus;&gt;%[
... ]; # same as %$aref[ ... ] <br>
$href&minus;&gt;%{ ... }; # same as %$href{ ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As with postfix
array, postfix value slice dereferencing <i>can</i> be used
in interpolating strings (double quotes or the

&quot;postderef_qq&quot; feature is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Assigning to
References</b> <br>
Beginning in v5.22.0, the referencing operator can be
assigned to. It performs an aliasing operation, so that the
variable name referenced on the left-hand side becomes an
alias for the thing referenced on the right-hand side:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\$a = \$b; # $a

must be enabled with &quot;use feature 'refaliasing'&quot;.
It is experimental, and will warn by default unless &quot;no
warnings 'experimental::refaliasing'&quot; is in effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These forms may
be assigned to, and cause the right-hand side to be
evaluated in scalar context:</p>

(and possibly also
&quot;my&quot;/&quot;state&quot;/&quot;our&quot;/&quot;local&quot;)
will make each element of the array an alias to the

Aliasing does not work correctly with closures. If you try
to alias lexical variables from an inner subroutine or

that inner sub, and will not affect the outer subroutine
where the variables are declared. This bizarre behavior is
subject to change.</p>
