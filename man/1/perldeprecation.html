<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The purpose of
this document is to document what has been deprecated in
Perl, and by which version the deprecated feature will
disappear, or, for already removed features, when it was
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
will try to discuss what alternatives for the deprecated
features are available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The deprecated
features will be grouped by the version of Perl in which
they will be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
5.40</b> <i><br>
Downgrading a &quot;use VERSION&quot; to below v5.11</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once Perl has
seen a &quot;use VERSION&quot; declaration that requests a
version &quot;v5.11&quot; or above, a subsequent second
declaration that requests an earlier version will print a
deprecation warning. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use v5.14; <br>
say &quot;We can use v5.14's features here&quot;; <br>
use v5.10; # This prints a warning</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This behaviour
will be removed in Perl 5.40; such a subsequent request will
become a compile-time error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is because
of an intended related change to the interaction between
&quot;use VERSION&quot; and &quot;use strict&quot;. If you
specify a version &gt;= 5.11, strict is enabled implicitly.
If you request a version &lt; 5.11, strict will become
disabled <i>even if you had previously written</i> &quot;use
strict&quot;. This was not the previous behaviour of
&quot;use VERSION&quot;, which at present will track
explicitly-enabled strictness flags independently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
5.38</b> <i><br>
Pod::Html utility functions</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The definition
and documentation of three utility functions previously
importable from Pod::Html were moved to new package
Pod::Html::Util in Perl 5.36. While they remain importable
from Pod::Html in Perl 5.36, as of Perl 5.38 they will only
be importable, on request, from Pod::Html::Util.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
5.34</b> <br>
There are no deprecations or fatalizations scheduled for
Perl 5.34.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
5.32</b> <i><br>
Constants from lexical variables potentially modified
elsewhere</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You wrote
something like</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $var; <br>
$sub = sub () { $var };</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but $var is
referenced elsewhere and could be modified after the
&quot;sub&quot; expression is evaluated. Either it is
explicitly modified elsewhere (&quot;$var = 3&quot;) or it
is passed to a subroutine or to an operator like
&quot;printf&quot; or &quot;map&quot;, which may or may not
modify the variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Traditionally,
Perl has captured the value of the variable at that point
and turned the subroutine into a constant eligible for
inlining. In those cases where the variable can be modified
elsewhere, this breaks the behavior of closures, in which
the subroutine captures the variable itself, rather than its
value, so future changes to the variable are reflected in
the subroutine&rsquo;s return value.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you intended
for the subroutine to be eligible for inlining, then make
sure the variable is not referenced elsewhere, possibly by
copying it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $var2 =
$var; <br>
$sub = sub () { $var2 };</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you do want
this subroutine to be a closure that reflects future changes
to the variable that it closes over, add an explicit
&quot;return&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $var; <br>
$sub = sub () { return $var };</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This usage was
deprecated and as of Perl 5.32 is no longer allowed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Use of
strings with code points over 0xFF as arguments to
&quot;vec&quot;</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;vec&quot;
views its string argument as a sequence of bits. A string
containing a code point over 0xFF is nonsensical. This usage
is deprecated in Perl 5.28, and was removed in Perl
5.32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Use of code
points over 0xFF in string bitwise operators</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The string
bitwise operators, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;|&quot;,
&quot;^&quot;, and &quot;~&quot;, treat their operands as
strings of bytes. As such, values above 0xFF are
nonsensical. Some instances of these have been deprecated
since Perl 5.24, and were made fatal in 5.28, but it turns
out that in cases where the wide characters did not affect
the end result, no deprecation notice was raised, and so
remain legal. Now, all occurrences either are fatal or raise
a deprecation warning, so that the remaining legal
occurrences became fatal in 5.32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An example of
this is</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;&quot;
&amp; &quot;\x{100}&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The wide
character is not used in the &quot;&amp;&quot; operation
because the left operand is shorter. This now throws an
exception.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><i>hostname()</i></b>
<i>doesn&rsquo;t accept any arguments</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The function
&quot;hostname()&quot; in the Sys::Hostname module has
always been documented to be called with no arguments.
Historically it has not enforced this, and has actually
accepted and ignored any arguments. As a result, some users
have got the mistaken impression that an argument does
something useful. To avoid these bugs, the function is being
made strict. Passing arguments was deprecated in Perl 5.28
and became fatal in Perl 5.32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unescaped
left braces in regular expressions</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The simple rule
to remember, if you want to match a literal &quot;{&quot;
character (U+007B &quot;LEFT CURLY BRACKET&quot;) in a
regular expression pattern, is to escape each literal
instance of it in some way. Generally easiest is to precede
it with a backslash, like &quot;\{&quot; or enclose it in
square brackets (&quot;[{]&quot;). If the pattern delimiters
are also braces, any matching right brace (&quot;}&quot;)
should also be escaped to avoid confusing the parser, for
example,</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">qr{abc\{def\}ghi}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Forcing literal
&quot;{&quot; characters to be escaped will enable the Perl
language to be extended in various ways in future releases.
To avoid needlessly breaking existing code, the restriction
is not enforced in contexts where there are unlikely to ever
be extensions that could conflict with the use there of
&quot;{&quot; as a literal. A non-deprecation warning that
the left brace is being taken literally is raised in
contexts where there could be confusion about it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Literal uses of
&quot;{&quot; were deprecated in Perl 5.20, and some uses of
it started to give deprecation warnings since. These cases
were made fatal in Perl 5.26. Due to an oversight, not all
cases of a use of a literal &quot;{&quot; got a deprecation
warning. Some cases started warning in Perl 5.26, and were
made fatal in Perl 5.30. Other cases started in Perl 5.28,
and were made fatal in 5.32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>In
<small>XS</small> code, use of various macros dealing with
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small></i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The macros
below now require an extra parameter than in versions prior
to Perl 5.32. The final parameter in each one is a pointer
into the string supplied by the first parameter beyond which
the input will not be read. This prevents potential reading
beyond the end of the buffer.
&quot;isALPHANUMERIC_utf8&quot;, &quot;isASCII_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isBLANK_utf8&quot;, &quot;isCNTRL_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isDIGIT_utf8&quot;, &quot;isIDFIRST_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isPSXSPC_utf8&quot;, &quot;isSPACE_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isVERTWS_utf8&quot;, &quot;isWORDCHAR_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isXDIGIT_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isALPHANUMERIC_LC_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isALPHA_LC_utf8&quot;, &quot;isASCII_LC_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isBLANK_LC_utf8&quot;, &quot;isCNTRL_LC_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isDIGIT_LC_utf8&quot;, &quot;isGRAPH_LC_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isIDCONT_LC_utf8&quot;, &quot;isIDFIRST_LC_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isLOWER_LC_utf8&quot;, &quot;isPRINT_LC_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isPSXSPC_LC_utf8&quot;, &quot;isPUNCT_LC_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isSPACE_LC_utf8&quot;, &quot;isUPPER_LC_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isWORDCHAR_LC_utf8&quot;,
&quot;isXDIGIT_LC_utf8&quot;, &quot;toFOLD_utf8&quot;,
&quot;toLOWER_utf8&quot;, &quot;toTITLE_utf8&quot;, and
&quot;toUPPER_utf8&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since Perl
5.26, this functionality with the extra parameter has been
available by using a corresponding macro to each one of
these, and whose name is formed by appending
&quot;_safe&quot; to the base name. There is no change to
the functionality of those. For example,
&quot;isDIGIT_utf8_safe&quot; corresponds to
&quot;isDIGIT_utf8&quot;, and both now behave identically.
All are documented in &quot;Character case changing&quot; in
perlapi and &quot;Character classification&quot; in
perlapi.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This change was
originally scheduled for 5.30, but was delayed until
5.32.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;
was removed</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;File::Glob&quot;
has a function called &quot;glob&quot;, which just calls
&quot;bsd_glob&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;
was deprecated in Perl 5.8. A deprecation message was issued
from Perl 5.26 onwards, the function became fatal in Perl
5.30, and was removed entirely in Perl 5.32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Code using
&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot; should call
&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
5.30</b> <i><br>
$* is no longer supported</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before Perl
5.10, setting $* to a true value globally enabled multi-line
matching within a string. This relique from the past lost
its special meaning in 5.10. Use of this variable became a
fatal error in Perl 5.30, freeing the variable up for a
future special meaning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To enable
multiline matching one should use the &quot;/m&quot; regexp
modifier (possibly in combination with &quot;/s&quot;). This
can be set on a per match bases, or can be enabled per
lexical scope (including a whole file) with &quot;use re
'/m'&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>$# is no
longer supported</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This variable
used to have a special meaning -- it could be used to
control how numbers were formatted when printed. This seldom
used functionality was removed in Perl 5.10. In order to
free up the variable for a future special meaning, its use
became a fatal error in Perl 5.30.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To specify how
numbers are formatted when printed, one is advised to use
&quot;printf&quot; or &quot;sprintf&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Assigning
non-zero to $[ is fatal</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This variable
(and the corresponding &quot;array_base&quot; feature and
arybase module) allowed changing the base for array and
string indexing operations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setting this to
a non-zero value has been deprecated since Perl 5.12 and
throws a fatal error as of Perl 5.30.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;
will disappear</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;File::Glob&quot;
has a function called &quot;glob&quot;, which just calls
&quot;bsd_glob&quot;. However, its prototype is different
from the prototype of &quot;CORE::glob&quot;, and hence,
&quot;File::Glob::glob&quot; should not be used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;
was deprecated in Perl 5.8. A deprecation message was issued
from Perl 5.26 onwards, and in Perl 5.30 this was turned
into a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Code using
&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot; should call
&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unescaped
left braces in regular expressions (for 5.30)</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Unescaped left braces in regular expressions&quot;
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unqualified
&quot;dump()&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use of
&quot;dump()&quot; instead of &quot;CORE::dump()&quot; was
deprecated in Perl 5.8, and an unqualified
&quot;dump()&quot; is no longer available as of Perl
5.30.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;dump&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Using</i>
<b><i>my()</i></b> <i>in false conditional.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There has been
a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable
not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration
includes a false conditional. Some people have exploited
this bug to achieve a kind of static variable. To allow us
to fix this bug, people should not be relying on this
behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead,
it&rsquo;s recommended one uses &quot;state&quot; variables
to achieve the same effect:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use 5.10.0;
<br>
sub count {state $counter; return ++ $counter} <br>
say count (); # Prints 1 <br>
say count (); # Prints 2</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;state&quot;
variables were introduced in Perl 5.10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
you can achieve a similar static effect by declaring the
variable in a separate block outside the function, e.g.,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub f { my $x
if 0; return $x++ }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">becomes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">{ my $x; sub f
{ return $x++ } }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of
&quot;my()&quot; in a false conditional has been deprecated
in Perl 5.10, and became a fatal error in Perl 5.30.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Reading/writing
bytes from/to :utf8 handles.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>sysread()</b>, <b>recv()</b>, <b>syswrite()</b> and
<b>send()</b> operators are deprecated on handles that have
the &quot;:utf8&quot; layer, either explicitly, or
implicitly, eg., with the
&quot;:encoding(UTF&minus;16LE)&quot; layer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both
<b>sysread()</b> and <b>recv()</b> currently use only the
&quot;:utf8&quot; flag for the stream, ignoring the actual
layers. Since <b>sysread()</b> and <b>recv()</b> do no
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> validation they can end up
creating invalidly encoded scalars.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
<b>syswrite()</b> and <b>send()</b> use only the
&quot;:utf8&quot; flag, otherwise ignoring any layers. If
the flag is set, both write the value
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded, even if the layer is
some different encoding, such as the example above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ideally, all of
these operators would completely ignore the
&quot;:utf8&quot; state, working only with bytes, but this
would result in silently breaking existing code. To avoid
this a future version of perl will throw an exception when
any of <b>sysread()</b>, <b>recv()</b>, <b>syswrite()</b> or
<b>send()</b> are called on handle with the
&quot;:utf8&quot; layer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.30, it is no longer be possible to use <b>sysread()</b>,
<b>recv()</b>, <b>syswrite()</b> or <b>send()</b> to read or
send bytes from/to :utf8 handles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Use of
unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a
delimiter.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A grapheme is
what appears to a native-speaker of a language to be a
character. In Unicode (and hence Perl) a grapheme may
actually be several adjacent characters that together form a
complete grapheme. For example, there can be a base
character, like &quot;R&quot; and an accent, like a
circumflex &quot;^&quot;, that appear to be a single
character when displayed, with the circumflex hovering over
the &quot;R&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.30, use of delimiters which are non-standalone graphemes
is fatal, in order to move the language to be able to accept
multi-character graphemes as delimiters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, as of
Perl 5.30, delimiters which are unassigned code points but
that may someday become assigned are prohibited. Otherwise,
code that works today would fail to compile if the currently
unassigned delimiter ends up being something that
isn&rsquo;t a stand-alone grapheme. Because Unicode is never
going to assign non-character code points, nor code points
that are above the legal Unicode maximum, those can be
delimiters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
5.28</b> <i><br>
Attributes &quot;:locked&quot; and
&quot;:unique&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The attributes
&quot;:locked&quot; (on code references) and
&quot;:unique&quot; (on array, hash and scalar references)
have had no effect since Perl 5.005 and Perl 5.8.8
respectively. Their use has been deprecated since.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.28, these attributes are syntax errors. Since the
attributes do not do anything, removing them from your code
fixes the syntax error; and removing them will not influence
the behaviour of your code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Bare
here-document terminators</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl has
allowed you to use a bare here-document terminator to have
the here-document end at the first empty line. This practise
was deprecated in Perl 5.000; as of Perl 5.28, using a bare
here-document terminator throws a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are
encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form if you wish to
use an empty line as the terminator of the
here-document:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">print
&lt;&lt;&quot;&quot;; <br>
Print this line. <br>
# Previous blank line ends the here&minus;document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Setting $/
to a reference to a non-positive integer</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You assigned a
reference to a scalar to $/ where the referenced item is not
a positive integer. In older perls this <b>appeared</b> to
work the same as setting it to &quot;undef&quot; but was in
fact internally different, less efficient and with very bad
luck could have resulted in your file being split by a
stringified form of the reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Perl 5.20.0
this was changed so that it would be <b>exactly</b> the same
as setting $/ to undef, with the exception that this warning
would be thrown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As of Perl
5.28, setting $/ to a reference of a non-positive integer
throws a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are
recommended to change your code to set $/ to
&quot;undef&quot; explicitly if you wish to slurp the
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Limit on the
value of Unicode code points.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unicode only
allows code points up to 0x10FFFF, but Perl allows much
larger ones. Up till Perl 5.28, it was allowed to use code
points exceeding the maximum value of an integer
(&quot;IV_MAX&quot;). However, that did break the perl
interpreter in some constructs, including causing it to hang
in a few cases. The known problem areas were in
&quot;tr///&quot;, regular expression pattern matching using
quantifiers, as quote delimiters in
&quot;q<i>X</i>...<i>X</i>&quot; (where <i>X</i> is the
&quot;chr()&quot; of a large code point), and as the upper
limits in loops.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of out
of range code points was deprecated in Perl 5.24; as of Perl
5.28 using a code point exceeding &quot;IV_MAX&quot; throws
a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If your code is
to run on various platforms, keep in mind that the upper
limit depends on the platform. It is much larger on
64&minus;bit word sizes than 32&minus;bit ones. For
32&minus;bit integers, &quot;IV_MAX&quot; equals 0x7FFFFFFF,
for 64&minus;bit integers, &quot;IV_MAX&quot; equals
0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Use of
comma-less variable list in formats.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It was allowed
to use a list of variables in a format, without separating
them with commas. This usage has been deprecated for a long
time, and as of Perl 5.28, this throws a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Use of
&quot;\N{}&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use of
&quot;\N{}&quot; with nothing between the braces was
deprecated in Perl 5.24, and throws a fatal error as of Perl
5.28.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since such a
construct is equivalent to using an empty string, you are
recommended to remove such &quot;\N{}&quot; constructs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It used to be
legal to use &quot;open()&quot; to associate both a

no longer allowed</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As an (ahem)
accidental feature, &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; subroutines were
looked up as methods (using the @ISA hierarchy) even when
the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain
functions (e.g. &quot;Foo::bar()&quot;), not as methods
(e.g. &quot;Foo&minus;&gt;bar()&quot; or
&quot;$obj&minus;&gt;bar()&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This bug was
deprecated in Perl 5.004, has been rectified in Perl 5.28 by
using method lookup only for methods&rsquo;
&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The simple rule
is: Inheritance will not work when autoloading non-methods.
The simple fix for old code is: In any module that used to
depend on inheriting &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; for non-methods
from a base class named &quot;BaseClass&quot;, execute
&quot;*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD&quot; during
startup.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In code that
currently says &quot;use AutoLoader; @ISA =
qw(AutoLoader);&quot; you should remove AutoLoader from @ISA
and change &quot;use AutoLoader;&quot; to &quot;use
AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';&quot;.</p>

used to be deprecated, as it allowed strange action at a

rectify this have been scrapped, as users found that
rewriting a pending exception is actually a useful feature,
and not a bug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl never
