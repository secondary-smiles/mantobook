<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>histretch</b>
[<i>options</i>] [<i>file</i>]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Stretching
converts a binary HINT file, usually with the extension
<b>.hnt</b>, into an ASCII based HINT file, with the
extension <b>.hint</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The binary HINT
file format - also called &lsquo;short&rsquo; format - is
optimized for displaying HINT files. It can be parsed
equally well in forward and backward direction to enable
fast forward or backward navigation in the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ASCII based
HINT file format - also called &lsquo;long&rsquo; format -
is optimized for readability. It can be edited using a text
editor. Hence it allows simple modifications that would be
difficult to achieve when using the binary format. It is
also convenient when debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The binary HINT
file format is designed for on-screen reading of documents.
Using a HINT viewer to display a HINT file, its content will
dynamically adapt to the available display area. For
complete information on the HINT file format and programs to
view HINT files, see <b>https://hint.userweb.mwn.de</b>.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This version of
<b>histretch</b> understands the following command line
options:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-a</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Write auxiliar files to disk using the localized path
names as explained in the <b>FILES</b> section below.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Use this option
if you are stretching a HINT file that you later want to
shrink back to its binary format unless you know that you
have already all the auxiliary files contained in it.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-d&nbsp;</b><i>bitmask</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sets HINT file debugging flags
according to the <i>bitmask</i>. See the <b>--help</b>
option for details.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-f</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Force the replacement of existing auxiliary files. Use
this option together with the <b>-g</b> or <b>-a</b> option
to make sure that already exiting auxiliary files are
replaced by the auxiliary files contained in the HINT
file.</p> </td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>WARNING</b>:
This is a dangerous option especially together with the
<b>-g</b> option. Never use it on a HINT file of unknown
origin. It will possibly replace any file on your machine
you have write access to. If in doubt, don&rsquo;t use the
<b>-f</b> option.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>-g</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Write auxiliar files to disk
using the path names as stored in the HINT file. This option
is an alternative to the <b>-a</b> option and takes
precedence if given. If in doubt, don&rsquo;t use the
<b>-g</b> option. If you just want to stretch the HINT file,
then edit it, and then shrink it back to the binary format,
you should use the <b>-a</b> option.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">You may use
this option if you are stretching a HINT file on the same
machine and in the same directory where you have created the
HINT file. Then all files will be copied to the location
they came from in case they were deleted in the
meantime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
stretching a HINT file on one machine and the file was
created on a different machine, <b>histretch</b> will try to
copy an auxiliary file into the same directory that was used
when the HINT file was created, provided that you have the
necessary writing rights. This is probably where you want
the auxiliary file assuming that both machines have the same
directory structure.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>WARNING</b>:
This is a dangerous option especially together with the
<b>-f</b> option. Never use it on a HINT file of unknown
origin. It can possibly write (and replace) any file on your
machine where you have write access.</p>

replacing the extension <b>.hnt</b> by the extension
<b>.log</b>.</p> </td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-o&nbsp;</b><i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <i>name</i> for the output
file instead of deriving it from the name of the input file.
Append the extension <b>.hint</b> if the <i>name</i> does
not already has that extension.</p>

<p><b>-u</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Enable the use of UTF8 character codes. Without this
option, the output file is a pure ASCII file, because
character codes outside the ASCII range are written using
their numeric representation. With this option, the file
will always represent printable characters using their UTF8
character codes. This might make the output file more
readable if displayed using an UTF8 enabled program; but it
might be less readable if displayed by a program that does
not handle UTF8 characters properly. See also the <b>-x</b>
option.</p> </td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--version</b></p>

<p><b>-x</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Enable the use of hexadecimal character codes. Without
this option, characters that are not represented using their
character codes are represented using a decimal
representation of the character code. With this option a
hexadecimal representation is used. The range of character
codes that have a numeric representation includes the non
printable characters (character codes smaller than 32) and
unless the <b>-u</b> option is given, the character codes
with a value of 127 and above.</p></td></tr>

<h2>FILES
<a name="FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Binary HINT
files must contain all resources necessary to display the
file, for example font and image files. These files are
called auxiliary files. ASCII HINT files contain only the
path names of these files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When creating a
binary HINT file from an ASCII HINT file, it is necessary to
find these files, read them, and include them in the binary
output file. When creating an ASCII HINT file from a binary
HINT file, it is convenient if these files can be extracted
and written to the file system. To avoid clobbering
arbitrary directories with files when extracting auxiliary
files, it is possible to map the path names as stored in the
HINT file to <b>localized</b> path names before writing or
reading auxiliar files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When computing
a localized path name from a given path name, a distinction
is made between global resources, like fonts, that are
referenced by an absolute path name, and local resources,
for example an image, that are referenced by a relative path
name. The directory that starts the localized path name of
the former has the extension <b>.abs</b> and for the latter
the extension <b>.rel</b> is used. To keep auxiliary files
in these subdirectories even if their path contains links to
a parent directory, parent links &lsquo;<b>..</b>&rsquo; are
replaced by &lsquo;<b>__</b>&rsquo; links to
subdirectories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
given an input file <b>paper.hint,</b> the global resources
are stored in the <b>paper.abs</b> directory and local
resources are stored in <b>paper.rel</b>. An absolute path
like <b>/usr/share/fonts/</b> will then map to the localized
path <b>paper.abs/usr/share/fonts/</b> and a relative path
like <b>../image/img1.jpg</b> will then map to the localized
path <b>paper.rel/__/image/img1.jpg</b>.</p>
