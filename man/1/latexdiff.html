<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Briefly,
<i>latexdiff</i> is a utility program to aid in the
management of revisions of latex documents. It compares two
valid latex files, here called &quot;old.tex&quot; and
&quot;new.tex&quot;, finds significant differences between
them (i.e., ignoring the number of white spaces and position
of line breaks), and adds special commands to highlight the
differences. Where visual highlighting is not possible, e.g.
for changes in the formatting, the differences are
nevertheless marked up in the source. Note that old.tex and
new.tex need to be real files (not pipes or similar) as they
are opened twice (unless &quot;&minus;&minus;encoding&quot;
option is used)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The program
treats the preamble differently from the main document.
Differences between the preambles are found using line-based
differencing (similarly to the Unix diff command, but
ignoring white spaces). A comment,
&quot;&quot;%DIF&nbsp;&gt;&quot;&quot; is appended to each
added line, i.e. a line present in &quot;new.tex&quot; but
not in &quot;old.tex&quot;. Discarded lines <br>
are deactivated by prepending
&quot;&quot;%DIF&nbsp;&lt;&quot;&quot;. Changed blocks are
preceded by comment lines giving information about line
numbers in the original files. Where there are insignificant
differences, the resulting file &quot;diff.tex&quot; will be
similar to &quot;new.tex&quot;. At the end of the preamble,
the definitions for <i>latexdiff</i> markup commands are
inserted. In differencing the main body of the text,
<i>latexdiff</i> attempts to satisfy the following
guidelines (in order of priority):</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>If both &quot;old.tex&quot; and &quot;new.tex&quot; are
valid LaTeX, then the resulting &quot;diff.tex&quot; should
also be valid LateX. ( <small>NB</small> If a few plain TeX
commands are used within &quot;old.tex&quot; or
&quot;new.tex&quot; then &quot;diff.tex&quot; is not
guaranteed to work but usually will).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Significant differences are determined on the level of
individual words. All significant differences, including
differences between comments should be clearly marked in the
resulting source code &quot;diff.tex&quot;.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>3.</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>If a changed passage contains text or text-producing
commands, then running &quot;diff.tex&quot; through LateX
should produce output where added and discarded passages are
highlighted.</p> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>4.</p></td>
<td width="1%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p>Where there are insignificant differences, e.g. in the
positioning of line breaks, &quot;diff.tex&quot; should
follow the formatting of &quot;new.tex&quot;</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
differencing the same algorithm as <i>diff</i> is used but
words instead of lines are compared. An attempt is made to
recognize blocks which are completely changed such that they
can be marked up as a unit. Comments are differenced line by
line but the number of spaces within comments is ignored.
Commands including all their arguments are generally
compared as one unit, i.e., no mark-up is inserted into the
arguments of commands. However, for a selected number of
commands (for example, &quot;\caption&quot; and all
sectioning commands) the last argument is known to be text.
This text is split into words and differenced just as
ordinary text (use options to show and change the list of
text commands, see below). As the algorithm has no detailed
knowledge of LaTeX, it assumes all pairs of curly braces
immediately following a command (i.e. a sequence of letters
beginning with a backslash) are arguments for that command.
As a restriction to condition 1 above it is thus necessary
to surround all arguments with curly braces, and to not
insert extraneous spaces. For example, write</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\section{\textem{This
is an emphasized section title}}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and not</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\section
{\textem{This is an emphasized section title}}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">\section\textem{This
is an emphasized section title}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">even though all
varieties are the same to LaTeX (but see
<b>&minus;&minus;allow&minus;spaces</b> option which allows
the second variety).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
environments whose content does not conform to standard
LaTeX or where graphical markup does not make sense all
markup commands can be removed by setting the
<small>PICTUREENV</small> configuration variable, set by
default to &quot;picture&quot; and &quot;DIFnomarkup&quot;
environments; see <b>&minus;&minus;config</b> option). The
latter environment (&quot;DIFnomarkup&quot;) can be used to
protect parts of the latex file where the markup results in
illegal markup. You have to surround the offending passage
in both the old and new file by
&quot;\begin{DIFnomarkup}&quot; and
&quot;\end{DIFnomarkup}&quot;. You must define the
environment in the preambles of both old and new documents.
I prefer to define it as a null-environment,</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;\newenvironment{DIFnomarkup}{}{}&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but the choice
is yours. Any markup within the environment will be removed,
and generally everything within the environment will just be
taken from the new file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to difference files which do not have a preamble.
<br>
In this case, the file is processed in the main document
mode, but the definitions of the markup commands are not
inserted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All markup
commands inserted by <i>latexdiff</i> begin with
&quot;&quot;\DIF&quot;&quot;. Added blocks containing words,
commands or comments which are in &quot;new.tex&quot; but
not in &quot;old.tex&quot; are marked by
&quot;\DIFaddbegin&quot; and &quot;\DIFaddend&quot;.
Discarded blocks are marked by &quot;\DIFdelbegin&quot; and
&quot;\DIFdelend&quot;. Within added blocks all text is
highlighted with &quot;\DIFadd&quot; like this:
&quot;\DIFadd{Added text block}&quot; Selected
&lsquo;safe&rsquo; commands can be contained in these text
blocks as well (use options to show and change the list of
safe commands, see below). All other commands as well as
braces &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; are never put within
the scope of &quot;\DIFadd&quot;. Added comments are marked
by prepending
&quot;&quot;%DIF&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within deleted
blocks text is highlighted with &quot;\DIFdel&quot;. Deleted
comments are marked by prepending
&quot;&quot;%DIF&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;. Non-safe
command and curly braces within deleted blocks are commented
out with
&quot;&quot;%DIFDELCMD&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&quot;&quot;.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Preamble</b>
<br>
The following options determine the visual markup style by
adding the appropriate command definitions to the preamble.
See the end of this section for a description of available
styles. <b><br>
&minus;&minus;type=markupstyle</b> or <b>&minus;t
markupstyle</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add code to preamble for
selected markup style. This option defines
&quot;\DIFadd&quot; and &quot;\DIFdel&quot; commands.
Available styles:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;UNDERLINE
CTRADITIONAL TRADITIONAL CFONT FONTSTRIKE INVISIBLE
CHANGEBAR CCHANGEBAR CULINECHBAR CFONTCHBAR BOLD
PDFCOMMENT&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[ Default:
&quot;UNDERLINE&quot; ]</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;subtype=markstyle</b>
or <b>&minus;s markstyle</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add code to preamble for
selected style for bracketing commands (e.g. to mark changes
in margin). This option defines &quot;\DIFaddbegin&quot;,
&quot;\DIFaddend&quot;, &quot;\DIFdelbegin&quot; and
&quot;\DIFdelend&quot; commands. Available styles:
&quot;SAFE MARGIN COLOR DVIPSCOL ZLABEL ONLYCHANGEDPAGE
(LABEL)*&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[ Default:
&quot;SAFE&quot; ] * Subtype &quot;LABEL&quot; is
deprecated</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;floattype=markstyle</b>
or <b>&minus;f markstyle</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Add code to preamble for
selected style which replace standard marking and markup
commands within floats (e.g., marginal remarks cause an
error within floats so marginal marking can be disabled
thus). This option defines all &quot;\DIF...FL&quot;
commands. Available styles: &quot;FLOATSAFE TRADITIONALSAFE
IDENTICAL&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[ Default:
&quot;FLOATSAFE&quot; ]</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;encoding=enc</b>
or <b>&minus;e enc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify encoding of old.tex and
new.tex. Typical encodings are &quot;ascii&quot;,
&quot;utf8&quot;, &quot;latin1&quot;, &quot;latin9&quot;. A
list of available encodings can be obtained by executing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;perl
&minus;MEncode &minus;e 'print join
(&quot;\n&quot;,Encode&minus;&quot;encodings(
&quot;:all&quot; )) ;&rsquo; &gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If this option
is used, then old.tex, new.tex are only opened once.
[Default encoding is utf8 unless the first few lines of the
preamble contain an invocation
&quot;\usepackage[..]{inputenc}&quot; in which case the
encoding chosen by this command is asssumed. Note that
<small>ASCII</small> (standard latex) is a subset of
utf8]</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;preamble=file</b>
or <b>&minus;p file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Insert file at end of preamble
instead of generating preamble. The preamble must define the
following commands &quot;\DIFaddbegin, \DIFaddend,
\DIFadd{..}, \DIFdelbegin,\DIFdelend,\DIFdel{..},&quot; and
varieties for use within floats &quot;\DIFaddbeginFL,
\DIFaddendFL, \DIFaddFL{..}, \DIFdelbeginFL, \DIFdelendFL,
\DIFdelFL{..}&quot; (If this option is set <b>&minus;t</b>,
<b>&minus;s</b>, and <b>&minus;f</b> options are
ignored.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;packages=pkg1,pkg2,..</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Tell latexdiff that .tex file
is processed with the packages in list loaded. This is
normally not necessary if the .tex file includes the
preamble, as the preamble is automatically scanned for
&quot;\usepackage&quot; commands. Use of the
<b>&minus;&minus;packages</b> option disables automatic
scanning, so if for any reason package specific parsing
needs to be switched off, use
<b>&minus;&minus;packages=none</b>. The following packages
trigger special behaviour: <br>
&quot;amsmath&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Configuration variable
<small>MATHARRREPL</small> is set to &quot;align*&quot;
(Default: &quot;eqnarray*&quot;). (Note that many of the
amsmath array environments are already recognised by default
as such)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;endfloat&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Ensure that
&quot;\begin{figure}&quot; and &quot;\end{figure}&quot;
always appear by themselves on a line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;hyperref&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Change name of
&quot;\DIFadd&quot; and &quot;\DIFdel&quot; commands to
&quot;\DIFaddtex&quot; and &quot;\DIFdeltex&quot; and define
new &quot;\DIFadd&quot; and &quot;\DIFdel&quot; commands,
which provide a wrapper for these commands, using them for
the text but not for the link defining command (where any
markup would cause errors).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;apacite&quot;,
&quot;biblatex&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Redefine the commands
recognised as citation commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;siunitx&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Treat &quot;\SI&quot; as
equivalent to citation commands (i.e. protect with
&quot;\mbox&quot; if markup style uses ulem package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;cleveref&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Treat &quot;\cref,\Cref&quot;,
etc as equivalent to citation commands (i.e. protect with
&quot;\mbox&quot; if markup style uses ulem package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;glossaries&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Define most of the glossaries
commands as safe, protecting them with \mbox&rsquo;es where
needed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;mhchem&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Treat &quot;\ce&quot; as a safe
command, i.e. it will be highlighted (note that
&quot;\cee&quot; will not be highlighted in equations as
this leads to processing errors)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;chemformula&quot; or
&quot;chemmacros&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:29%;">Treat &quot;\ch&quot; as a safe
command outside equations, i.e. it will be highlighted (note
that &quot;\ch&quot; will not be highlighted in equations as
this leads to processing errors)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">[ Default: scan
the preamble for &quot;\usepackage&quot; commands to
determine <br>
loaded packages. ]</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;preamble</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print generated or included
preamble commands to stdout.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Configuration
<br>
&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;safecmd=exclude&minus;file</b>
or <b>&minus;A exclude-file</b> or <b><br>

&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;safecmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot;
<br>
&minus;&minus;replace&minus;safecmd=replace&minus;file <br>
&minus;&minus;append&minus;safecmd=append&minus;file</b> or
<b>&minus;a append-file</b> or <b><br>

&minus;&minus;append&minus;safecmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exclude from, replace or append
to the list of regular expressions (RegEx) matching commands
which are safe to use within the scope of a
&quot;\DIFadd&quot; or &quot;\DIFdel&quot; command. The file
must contain one Perl-RegEx per line (Comment lines
beginning with # or % are ignored). Note that the RegEx
needs to match the whole of the token, i.e., /^regex$/ is
implied and that the initial &quot;\&quot; of the command is
not included. The <b>&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;safecmd</b>
and <b>&minus;&minus;append&minus;safecmd</b> options can be
combined with the
&minus;<b>&minus;&minus;replace&minus;safecmd</b> option and
can be used repeatedly to add cumulatively to the lists.
<b><br>
&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;safecmd</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;append&minus;safecmd</b> can also take a
comma separated list as input. If a comma for one of the
regex is required, escape it thus &quot;\,&quot;. In most
cases it will be necessary to protect the comma-separated
list from the shell by putting it in quotation marks.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;textcmd=exclude&minus;file</b>
or <b>&minus;X exclude-file</b> or <b><br>

&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;textcmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot;
<br>
&minus;&minus;replace&minus;textcmd=replace&minus;file <br>
&minus;&minus;append&minus;textcmd=append&minus;file</b> or
<b>&minus;x append-file</b> or <b><br>

&minus;&minus;append&minus;textcmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Exclude from, replace or append
to the list of regular expressions matching commands whose
last argument is text. See entry for
<b>&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;safecmd</b> directly above
for further details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;replace&minus;context1cmd=replace&minus;file
<br>

&minus;&minus;append&minus;context1cmd=append&minus;file</b>
or <b><br>

&minus;&minus;append&minus;context1cmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Replace or append to the list
of regex matching commands whose last argument is text but
which require a particular context to work, e.g.
&quot;\caption&quot; will only work within a figure or
table. These commands behave like text commands, except when
they occur in a deleted section, when they are disabled, but
their argument is shown as deleted text.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;replace&minus;context2cmd=replace&minus;file
<br>

&minus;&minus;append&minus;context2cmd=append&minus;file</b>
or <b><br>

&minus;&minus;append&minus;context2cmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">As corresponding commands for
context1. The only difference is that context2 commands are
completely disabled in deleted sections, including their
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">context2
commands are also the only commands in the preamble, whose
argument will be processed in word-by-word mode (which only
works, if they occur no more than once in the preamble). The
algorithm currently cannot cope with repeated context2
commands in the preamble, as they occur e.g. for the
&quot;\author&quot; argument in some journal styles (not in
the standard styles, though If such a repetition is
detected, the whole preamble will be processed in
line-by-line mode. In such a case, use
&quot;&minus;&minus;replace&minus;context2cmd&quot; option
to just select the commands, which should be processed and
are not used repeatedly in the preamble.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;mboxsafecmd=exclude&minus;file</b>
or <b><br>

&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;mboxsafecmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot;
<br>

&minus;&minus;append&minus;mboxsafecmd=append&minus;file</b>
or <b><br>

&minus;&minus;append&minus;mboxsafecmd=&quot;cmd1,cmd2,...&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Define safe commands, which
additionally need to be protected by encapsulating in an
&quot;\mbox{..}&quot;. This is sometimes needed to get
around incompatibilities between external packages and the
ulem package, which is used for highlighting in the default
style <small>UNDERLINE</small> as well as <small>CULINECHBAR
CFONTSTRIKE</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;config
var1=val1,var2=val2,...</b> or <b>&minus;c var1=val1,.. <br>
&minus;c configfile</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set configuration variables.
The option can be repeated to set different variables (as an
alternative to the comma-separated list). Available
variables (see below for further explanations):</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;ARRENV&quot;
(RegEx)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;COUNTERCMD&quot;
(RegEx)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;CUSTODIFCMD&quot;
(RegEx)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;FLOATENV&quot;
(RegEx)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;ITEMCMD&quot;
(RegEx)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;LISTENV&quot;
(RegEx)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;MATHARRENV&quot;
(RegEx)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;MATHARRREPL&quot;
(String)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;MATHENV&quot;
(RegEx)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;MATHREPL&quot;
(String)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;MINWORDSBLOCK&quot;

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;PICTUREENV&quot;
(RegEx)</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;SCALEDELGRAPHICS&quot;
(Float)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;add&minus;to&minus;config
varenv1=pattern1,varenv2=pattern2,...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">For configuration variables,
which are a regular expression (essentially those ending in
<small>ENV, COUNTERCMD</small> and
<small>CUSTOMDIFCMD,</small> see list above) this option
provides an alternative way to modify the configuration
variables. Instead of setting the complete pattern, with
this option it is possible to add an alternative pattern.
&quot;varenv&quot; must be one of the variables listed above
that take a regular expression as argument, and pattern is
any regular expression (which might need to be protected
from the shell by quotation). Several patterns can be added
at once by using semi-colons to separate them, e.g.
&quot;&minus;&minus;add&minus;to&minus;config
&quot;LISTENV=myitemize;myenumerate,COUNTERCMD=endnote&quot;&quot;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;safecmd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print list of RegEx matching
and excluding safe commands.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;textcmd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print list of RegEx matching
and excluding commands with text argument.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;config</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show values of configuration
variables.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Combine all &minus;&minus;show
commands.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NB</small>
For all &minus;&minus;show commands, no &quot;old.tex&quot;
or &quot;new.tex&quot; file needs to be specified, and no
differencing takes place.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Other
configuration options: <br>
&minus;&minus;allow&minus;spaces</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Allow spaces between bracketed
or braced arguments to commands. Note that this option might
have undesirable side effects (unrelated scope might get
lumpeded with preceding commands) so should only be used if
the default produces erroneous results. (Default requires
arguments to directly follow each other without intervening
spaces).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;math&minus;markup=level</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Determine granularity of markup
in displayed math environments: Possible values for level
are (both numerical and text labels are acceptable):</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;off&quot;
or 0: suppress markup for math environments. Deleted
equations will not appear in diff file. This mode can be
used if all the other modes cause invalid latex code.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;whole&quot;
or 1: Differencing on the level of whole equations. Even
trivial changes to equations cause the whole equation to be
marked changed. This mode can be used if processing in
coarse or fine mode results in invalid latex code.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;coarse&quot;
or 2: Detect changes within equations marked up with a
coarse granularity; changes in equation type
(e.g.displaymath to equation) appear as a change to the
complete equation. This mode is recommended for situations
where the content and order of some equations are still
being changed. [Default]</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;fine&quot;

present in the preamble, only those files are expanded into
the document. However, no recursion is done, i.e.
&quot;\input&quot; and &quot;\include&quot; commands within
included sections are not expanded. The included files are
assumed to <br>
be located in the same directories as the old and new master
files, respectively, making it possible to organise files
into old and new directories. &minus;&minus;flatten is
applied recursively, so inputted files can contain further

<h2>COMMON PROBLEMS AND FAQ
<a name="COMMON PROBLEMS AND FAQ"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Citations
result in overfull boxes</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">There is an incompatibility
between the &quot;ulem&quot; package, which
&quot;latexdiff&quot; uses for underlining and striking out
in the <small>UNDERLINE</small> style, the default style,
and the way citations are generated. In order to be able to
mark up citations properly, they are enclosed with an
&quot;\mbox&quot; command. As mboxes cannot be broken across
lines, this procedure frequently results in overfull boxes,
possibly obscuring the content as it extends beyond the
right margin. The same occurs for some other packages (e.g.,
siunitx). If this is a problem, you have two
possibilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em">1. Use
&quot;CFONT&quot; type markup (option &quot;&minus;t
CFONT&quot;): If this markup is chosen, then changed
citations are no longer marked up with the wavy line
(additions) or struck out (deletions), but are still
highlighted in the appropriate color, and deleted text is
shown with a different font. Other styles not using the
&quot;ulem&quot; package will also work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em">2. Choose
option
&quot;&minus;&minus;disable&minus;citation&minus;markup&quot;
which turns off the marking up of citations: deleted
citations are no longer shown, and added citations are shown
without markup. (This was the default behaviour of latexdiff
at versions 0.6 and older)</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em">For custom
packages you can define the commands which need to be
protected by &quot;\mbox&quot; with
&quot;&minus;&minus;append&minus;mboxsafecmd&quot; and
&quot;&minus;&minus;excludemboxsafecmd&quot; options (submit
your lists of command as feature request at github page to
set the default behaviour of future versions, see section
6)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Changes in complicated
mathematical equations result in latex <br>
processing errors</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Try options
&quot;&minus;&minus;math&minus;markup=whole&quot;. If even
that fails, you can turn off mark up for equations with
&quot;&minus;&minus;math&minus;markup=off&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">How can I just show the pages
where changes had been made</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">Use options
&minus;&quot;&minus;s ZLABEL&quot; (some postprocessing
required) or &quot;&minus;s ONLYCHANGEDPAGE&quot;.
&quot;latexdiff&minus;vc
&minus;&minus;ps|&minus;&minus;pdf&quot; with

care of the post-processing for you (requires zref package
to be installed).</p>

edited to only contain the offending passage as long as that
still reproduces the problem. If your file relies on
non-standard class files, you must include those. I will not
look at examples where I have trouble to latex the original
files.</p>

<h2>PORTABILITY
<a name="PORTABILITY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>latexdiff</i>
does not make use of external commands and thus should run
on any platform supporting Perl 5.6 or higher. If files with
encodings other than <small>ASCII</small> or
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> are processed, Perl 5.8 or higher
is required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The standard
version of <i>latexdiff</i> requires installation of the
Perl package &quot;Algorithm::Diff&quot; (available from
<i>www.cpan.org</i> &minus;
<i>http://search.cpan.org/~nedkonz/Algorithm&minus;Diff&minus;1.15</i>)
but a stand-alone version, <i>latexdiff-so</i>, which has
this package inlined, is available, too.
<i>latexdiff-fast</i> requires the <i>diff</i> command to be
present.</p>
