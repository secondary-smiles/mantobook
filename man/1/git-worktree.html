<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Manage multiple
working trees attached to the same repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A git
repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you
to check out more than one branch at a time. With <b>git
worktree add</b> a new working tree is associated with the
repository, along with additional metadata that
differentiates that working tree from others in the same
repository. The working tree, along with this metadata, is
called a &quot;worktree&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This new
worktree is called a &quot;linked worktree&quot; as opposed
to the &quot;main worktree&quot; prepared by
<b>git-init</b>(1) or <b>git-clone</b>(1). A repository has
one main worktree (if it&rsquo;s not a bare repository) and
zero or more linked worktrees. When you are done with a
linked worktree, remove it with <b>git worktree
remove</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In its simplest
form, <b>git worktree add &lt;path&gt;</b> automatically
creates a new branch whose name is the final component of
<b>&lt;path&gt;</b>, which is convenient if you plan to work
on a new topic. For instance, <b>git worktree add
../hotfix</b> creates new branch <b>hotfix</b> and checks it
out at path <b>../hotfix</b>. To instead work on an existing
branch in a new worktree, use <b>git worktree add
&lt;path&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</b>. On the other hand, if you
just plan to make some experimental changes or do testing
without disturbing existing development, it is often
convenient to create a <i>throwaway</i> worktree not
associated with any branch. For instance, <b>git worktree
add &minus;d &lt;path&gt;</b> creates a new worktree with a
detached <b>HEAD</b> at the same commit as the current
branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a working
tree is deleted without using <b>git worktree remove</b>,
then its associated administrative files, which reside in
the repository (see &quot;DETAILS&quot; below), will
eventually be removed automatically (see
<b>gc.worktreePruneExpire</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1)), or
you can run <b>git worktree prune</b> in the main or any
linked worktree to clean up any stale administrative
files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the working
tree for a linked worktree is stored on a portable device or
network share which is not always mounted, you can prevent
its administrative files from being pruned by issuing the
<b>git worktree lock</b> command, optionally specifying
<b>&minus;&minus;reason</b> to explain why the worktree is
locked.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">add
&lt;path&gt; [&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a worktree at
<b>&lt;path&gt;</b> and checkout
<b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b> into it. The new worktree is
linked to the current repository, sharing everything except
per&minus;worktree files such as <b>HEAD</b>, <b>index</b>,
etc. As a convenience, <b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b> may
be a bare &quot;<b>&minus;</b>&quot;, which is synonymous
with <b>@{&minus;1}</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b> is a branch name (call it
<b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>) and is not found, and neither
<b>&minus;b</b> nor <b>&minus;B</b> nor
<b>&minus;&minus;detach</b> are used, but there does exist a
tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it
<b>&lt;remote&gt;</b>) with a matching name, treat as
equivalent to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
add &minus;&minus;track &minus;b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;path&gt;
&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the branch
exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named by the
<b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> configuration variable,
we&rsquo;ll use that one for the purposes of disambiguation,
even if the <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> isn&rsquo;t unique across
all remotes. Set it to e.g.
<b>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</b> to always checkout
remote branches from there if <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> is
ambiguous but exists on the <b>origin</b> remote. See also
<b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b> is omitted and neither
<b>&minus;b</b> nor <b>&minus;B</b> nor
<b>&minus;&minus;detach</b> used, then, as a convenience,
the new worktree is associated with a branch (call it
<b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>) named after <b>$(basename
&lt;path&gt;)</b>. If <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> doesn&rsquo;t
exist, a new branch based on <b>HEAD</b> is automatically
created as if <b>&minus;b &lt;branch&gt;</b> was given. If
<b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> does exist, it will be checked out in
the new worktree, if it&rsquo;s not checked out anywhere
else, otherwise the command will refuse to create the
worktree (unless <b>&minus;&minus;force</b> is used).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">list</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List details of each worktree.
The main worktree is listed first, followed by each of the
linked worktrees. The output details include whether the
worktree is bare, the revision currently checked out, the
branch currently checked out (or &quot;detached HEAD&quot;
if none), &quot;locked&quot; if the worktree is locked,
&quot;prunable&quot; if the worktree can be pruned by the
<b>prune</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">lock</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a worktree is on a portable
device or network share which is not always mounted, lock it
to prevent its administrative files from being pruned
automatically. This also prevents it from being moved or
deleted. Optionally, specify a reason for the lock with
<b>&minus;&minus;reason</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">move</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Move a worktree to a new
location. Note that the main worktree or linked worktrees
containing submodules cannot be moved with this command.
(The <b>git worktree repair</b> command, however, can
reestablish the connection with linked worktrees if you move
the main worktree manually.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prune</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prune worktree information in
<b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">remove</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove a worktree. Only clean
worktrees (no untracked files and no modification in tracked
files) can be removed. Unclean worktrees or ones with
submodules can be removed with <b>&minus;&minus;force</b>.
The main worktree cannot be removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">repair
[&lt;path&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Repair worktree administrative
files, if possible, if they have become corrupted or
outdated due to external factors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For instance,
if the main worktree (or bare repository) is moved, linked
worktrees will be unable to locate it. Running <b>repair</b>
in the main worktree will reestablish the connection from
linked worktrees back to the main worktree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, if
the working tree for a linked worktree is moved without
using <b>git worktree move</b>, the main worktree (or bare
repository) will be unable to locate it. Running
<b>repair</b> within the recently&minus;moved worktree will
reestablish the connection. If multiple linked worktrees are
moved, running <b>repair</b> from any worktree with each
tree&rsquo;s new <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> as an argument, will
reestablish the connection to all the specified paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If both the
main worktree and linked worktrees have been moved manually,
then running <b>repair</b> in the main worktree and
specifying the new <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> of each linked
worktree will reestablish all connections in both
directions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">unlock</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Unlock a worktree, allowing it
to be pruned, moved or deleted.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;f,
&minus;&minus;force</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, <b>add</b> refuses
to create a new worktree when
<b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b> is a branch name and is
already checked out by another worktree, or if
<b>&lt;path&gt;</b> is already assigned to some worktree but
is missing (for instance, if <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> was deleted
manually). This option overrides these safeguards. To add a
missing but locked worktree path, specify
<b>&minus;&minus;force</b> twice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>move</b>
refuses to move a locked worktree unless
<b>&minus;&minus;force</b> is specified twice. If the
destination is already assigned to some other worktree but
is missing (for instance, if <b>&lt;new&minus;path&gt;</b>
was deleted manually), then <b>&minus;&minus;force</b>
allows the move to proceed; use <b>&minus;&minus;force</b>
twice if the destination is locked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>remove</b>
refuses to remove an unclean worktree unless
<b>&minus;&minus;force</b> is used. To remove a locked
worktree, specify <b>&minus;&minus;force</b> twice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;b
&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;, &minus;B
&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>add</b>, create a new
branch named <b>&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</b> starting at
<b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b>, and check out
<b>&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</b> into the new worktree. If
<b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b> is omitted, it defaults to
<b>HEAD</b>. By default, <b>&minus;b</b> refuses to create a
new branch if it already exists. <b>&minus;B</b> overrides
this safeguard, resetting <b>&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</b> to
<b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;d,
&minus;&minus;detach</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>add</b>, detach
<b>HEAD</b> in the new worktree. See &quot;DETACHED
HEAD&quot; in <b>git-checkout</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]checkout</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, <b>add</b> checks
out <b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b>, however,
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;checkout</b> can be used to
suppress checkout in order to make customizations, such as
configuring sparse&minus;checkout. See &quot;Sparse
checkout&quot; in <b>git-read-tree</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]guess&minus;remote</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>worktree add
&lt;path&gt;</b>, without <b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b>,
instead of creating a new branch from <b>HEAD</b>, if there
exists a tracking branch in exactly one remote matching the
basename of <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>, base the new branch on the
remote&minus;tracking branch, and mark the
remote&minus;tracking branch as &quot;upstream&quot; from
the new branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This can also
be set up as the default behaviour by using the
<b>worktree.guessRemote</b> config option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]track</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When creating a new branch, if
<b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b> is a branch, mark it as
&quot;upstream&quot; from the new branch. This is the
default if <b>&lt;commit&minus;ish&gt;</b> is a
remote&minus;tracking branch. See <b>&minus;&minus;track</b>
in <b>git-branch</b>(1) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;lock</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Keep the worktree locked after
creation. This is the equivalent of <b>git worktree lock</b>
after <b>git worktree add</b>, but without a race
condition.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;n,
&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>prune</b>, do not
remove anything; just report what it would remove.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;porcelain</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>list</b>, output in an
easy&minus;to&minus;parse format for scripts. This format
will remain stable across Git versions and regardless of
user configuration. It is recommended to combine this with
<b>&minus;z</b>. See below for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;z</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Terminate each line with a NUL
rather than a newline when <b>&minus;&minus;porcelain</b> is
specified with <b>list</b>. This makes it possible to parse
the output when a worktree path contains a newline
character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;q,
&minus;&minus;quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>add</b>, suppress
feedback messages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;v,
&minus;&minus;verbose</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>prune</b>, report all
removals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>list</b>, output additional information about worktrees
(see below).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;expire
&lt;time&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>prune</b>, only expire
unused worktrees older than <b>&lt;time&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>list</b>, annotate missing worktrees as prunable if they
are older than <b>&lt;time&gt;</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;reason
&lt;string&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With <b>lock</b> or with <b>add
&minus;&minus;lock</b>, an explanation why the worktree is
locked.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;worktree&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Worktrees can be identified by
path, either relative or absolute.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the last
path components in the worktree&rsquo;s path is unique among
worktrees, it can be used to identify a worktree. For
example if you only have two worktrees, at
<b>/abc/def/ghi</b> and <b>/abc/def/ggg</b>, then <b>ghi</b>
or <b>def/ghi</b> is enough to point to the former
worktree.</p>

<h2>REFS
<a name="REFS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using
multiple worktrees, some refs are shared between all
worktrees, but others are specific to an individual
worktree. One example is <b>HEAD</b>, which is different for
each worktree. This section is about the sharing rules and
how to access refs of one worktree from another.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, all
pseudo refs are per&minus;worktree and all refs starting
with <b>refs/</b> are shared. Pseudo refs are ones like
<b>HEAD</b> which are directly under <b>$GIT_DIR</b> instead
of inside <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b>. There are exceptions,
however: refs inside <b>refs/bisect</b> and
<b>refs/worktree</b> are not shared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Refs that are
per&minus;worktree can still be accessed from another
worktree via two special paths, <b>main&minus;worktree</b>
and <b>worktrees</b>. The former gives access to
per&minus;worktree refs of the main worktree, while the
latter to all linked worktrees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
<b>main&minus;worktree/HEAD</b> or
<b>main&minus;worktree/refs/bisect/good</b> resolve to the
same value as the main worktree&rsquo;s <b>HEAD</b> and
<b>refs/bisect/good</b> respectively. Similarly,
<b>worktrees/foo/HEAD</b> or
<b>worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</b> are the same as
<b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/foo/HEAD</b> and
<b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To access refs,
it&rsquo;s best not to look inside <b>$GIT_DIR</b> directly.
Instead use commands such as <b>git-rev-parse</b>(1) or
<b>git-update-ref</b>(1) which will handle refs
correctly.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION FILE
<a name="CONFIGURATION FILE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
repository <b>config</b> file is shared across all
worktrees. If the config variables <b>core.bare</b> or
<b>core.worktree</b> are present in the common config file
and <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> is disabled, then they
will be applied to the main worktree only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
have worktree&minus;specific configuration, you can turn on
the <b>worktreeConfig</b> extension, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git config
extensions.worktreeConfig true</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this mode,
specific configuration stays in the path pointed by <b>git
rev&minus;parse &minus;&minus;git&minus;path
config.worktree</b>. You can add or update configuration in
this file with <b>git config &minus;&minus;worktree</b>.
Older Git versions will refuse to access repositories with
this extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
this file, the exception for <b>core.bare</b> and
<b>core.worktree</b> is gone. If they exist in
<b>$GIT_DIR/config</b>, you must move them to the
<b>config.worktree</b> of the main worktree. You may also
take this opportunity to review and move other configuration
that you do not want to share to all worktrees:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>core.worktree</b> should never be shared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>core.bare</b> should not be shared if the value is
<b>core.bare=true</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>core.sparseCheckout</b> should not be shared, unless you
are sure you always use sparse checkout for all
worktrees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the
documentation of <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> in
<b>git-config</b>(1) for more details.</p>

<h2>DETAILS
<a name="DETAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each linked
worktree has a private sub&minus;directory in the
repository&rsquo;s <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> directory. The
private sub&minus;directory&rsquo;s name is usually the base
name of the linked worktree&rsquo;s path, possibly appended
with a number to make it unique. For example, when
<b>$GIT_DIR=/path/main/.git</b> the command <b>git worktree
add /path/other/test&minus;next next</b> creates the linked
worktree in <b>/path/other/test&minus;next</b> and also
creates a <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test&minus;next</b>
directory (or <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test&minus;next1</b> if
<b>test&minus;next</b> is already taken).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within a linked
worktree, <b>$GIT_DIR</b> is set to point to this private
directory (e.g.
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test&minus;next</b> in the
example) and <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> is set to point back to
the main worktree&rsquo;s <b>$GIT_DIR</b> (e.g.
<b>/path/main/.git</b>). These settings are made in a
<b>.git</b> file located at the top directory of the linked
worktree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Path resolution
via <b>git rev&minus;parse &minus;&minus;git&minus;path</b>
uses either <b>$GIT_DIR</b> or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b>
depending on the path. For example, in the linked worktree
<b>git rev&minus;parse &minus;&minus;git&minus;path HEAD</b>
returns
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test&minus;next/HEAD</b> (not
<b>/path/other/test&minus;next/.git/HEAD</b> or
<b>/path/main/.git/HEAD</b>) while <b>git rev&minus;parse
&minus;&minus;git&minus;path refs/heads/master</b> uses
<b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> and returns
<b>/path/main/.git/refs/heads/master</b>, since refs are
shared across all worktrees, except <b>refs/bisect</b> and
<b>refs/worktree</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>gitrepository-layout</b>(5) for more information. The
rule of thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a
path belongs to <b>$GIT_DIR</b> or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b>
when you need to directly access something inside
<b>$GIT_DIR</b>. Use <b>git rev&minus;parse
&minus;&minus;git&minus;path</b> to get the final path.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you manually
move a linked worktree, you need to update the <b>gitdir</b>
file in the entry&rsquo;s directory. For example, if a
linked worktree is moved to <b>/newpath/test&minus;next</b>
and its <b>.git</b> file points to
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test&minus;next</b>, then
update
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test&minus;next/gitdir</b> to
reference <b>/newpath/test&minus;next</b> instead. Better
yet, run <b>git worktree repair</b> to reestablish the
connection automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To prevent a
<b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> entry from being pruned (which can
be useful in some situations, such as when the entry&rsquo;s
worktree is stored on a portable device), use the <b>git
worktree lock</b> command, which adds a file named
<b>locked</b> to the entry&rsquo;s directory. The file
contains the reason in plain text. For example, if a linked
worktree&rsquo;s <b>.git</b> file points to
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test&minus;next</b> then a file
named
<b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test&minus;next/locked</b> will
prevent the <b>test&minus;next</b> entry from being pruned.
See <b>gitrepository-layout</b>(5) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> is enabled, the config file
<b>.git/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree</b> is read
after <b>.git/config</b> is.</p>

<h2>LIST OUTPUT FORMAT
<a name="LIST OUTPUT FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <b>worktree
list</b> command has two output formats. The default format
shows the details on a single line with columns. For
example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
list <br>
/path/to/bare&minus;source (bare) <br>
/path/to/linked&minus;worktree abcd1234 [master] <br>
/path/to/other&minus;linked&minus;worktree 1234abc (detached
HEAD)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
also shows annotations for each worktree, according to its
state. These annotations are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Porcelain
Format</b> <br>
The porcelain format has a line per attribute. If
<b>&minus;z</b> is given then the lines are terminated with
NUL rather than a newline. Attributes are listed with a
label and value separated by a single space. Boolean
attributes (like <b>bare</b> and <b>detached</b>) are listed
as a label only, and are present only if the value is true.
Some attributes (like <b>locked</b>) can be listed as a
label only or with a value depending upon whether a reason
is available. The first attribute of a worktree is always
<b>worktree</b>, an empty line indicates the end of the
record. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
list &minus;&minus;porcelain <br>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You are in the
middle of a refactoring session and your boss comes in and
demands that you fix something immediately. You might
typically use <b>git-stash</b>(1) to store your changes away
temporarily, however, your working tree is in such a state
of disarray (with new, moved, and removed files, and other
bits and pieces strewn around) that you don&rsquo;t want to
risk disturbing any of it. Instead, you create a temporary
linked worktree to make the emergency fix, remove it when
done, and then resume your earlier refactoring session.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git worktree
add &minus;b emergency&minus;fix ../temp master <br>
$ pushd ../temp <br>
# ... hack hack hack ... <br>
$ git commit &minus;a &minus;m 'emergency fix for boss' <br>
$ popd <br>
$ git worktree remove ../temp</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiple
checkout in general is still experimental, and the support
for submodules is incomplete. It is NOT recommended to make
multiple checkouts of a superproject.</p>
