</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemctl</b>
may be used to introspect and control the state of the
&quot;systemd&quot; system and service manager. Please refer
to <b>systemd</b>(1) for an introduction into the basic
concepts and functionality this tool manages.</p>

<h2>COMMANDS
<a name="COMMANDS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
commands are understood:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unit
Commands (Introspection and Modification) <br>
list&minus;units</b> [<i>PATTERN</i>...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List units that <b>systemd</b>
currently has in memory. This includes units that are either
referenced directly or through a dependency, units that are
pinned by applications programmatically, or units that were
active in the past and have failed. By default only units
which are active, have pending jobs, or have failed are
shown; this can be changed with option
<b>&minus;&minus;all</b>. If one or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are
specified, only units matching one of them are shown. The
units that are shown are additionally filtered by
<b>&minus;&minus;type=</b> and <b>&minus;&minus;state=</b>
if those options are specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
command does not show unit templates, but only instances of
unit templates. Units templates that aren't instantiated are
not runnable, and will thus never show up in the output of
this command. Specifically this means that foo@.service will
never be shown in this list &mdash; unless instantiated,
e.g. as foo@bar.service. Use
<b>list&minus;unit&minus;files</b> (see below) for listing
installed unit template files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Produces output
similar to</p>

possible values vary by unit type. The list of possible
LOAD, ACTIVE, and SUB states is not constant and new systemd
releases may both add and remove values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also see
<b>&minus;&minus;all</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;state=</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>is&minus;active</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Check whether any of the
specified units are active (i.e. running). Returns an exit
code <b>0</b> if at least one is active, or non&minus;zero
otherwise. Unless <b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b> is specified,
this will also print the current unit state to standard
output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>is&minus;failed</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Check whether any of the
specified units are in a &quot;failed&quot; state. Returns
an exit code <b>0</b> if at least one has failed,
non&minus;zero otherwise. Unless <b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b>
is specified, this will also print the current unit state to
standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>status</b>
[<i>PATTERN</i>...|<i>PID</i>...]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show runtime status information
about the whole system or about one or more units followed
by most recent log data from the journal. If no positional
arguments are specified, and no unit filter is given with
<b>&minus;&minus;type=</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;state=</b>, or
<b>&minus;&minus;failed</b>, shows the status of the whole
system. If combined with <b>&minus;&minus;all</b>, follows
that with the status of all units. If positional arguments
are specified, each positional argument is treated as either
a unit name to show, or a glob pattern to show units whose
names match that pattern, or a PID to show the unit
containing that PID. When <b>&minus;&minus;type=</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;state=</b>, or <b>&minus;&minus;failed</b>
are used, units are additionally filtered by the TYPE and
ACTIVE state.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This function
is intended to generate human&minus;readable output. If you
are looking for computer&minus;parsable output, use
<b>show</b> instead. By default, this function only shows 10
lines of output and ellipsizes lines to fit in the terminal
window. This can be changed with <b>&minus;&minus;lines</b>
and <b>&minus;&minus;full</b>, see above. In addition,
<b>journalctl &minus;&minus;unit=</b><i>NAME</i> or
<b>journalctl &minus;&minus;user&minus;unit=</b><i>NAME</i>
use a similar filter for messages and might be more
convenient.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
operation only displays <i>runtime</i> status, i.e.
information about the current invocation of the unit (if it
is running) or the most recent invocation (if it is not
running anymore, and has not been released from memory).
Information about earlier invocations, invocations from
previous system boots, or prior invocations that have
already been released from memory may be retrieved via
<b>journalctl &minus;&minus;unit=</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">systemd
implicitly loads units as necessary, so just running the
<b>status</b> will attempt to load a file. The command is
thus not useful for determining if something was already
loaded or not. The units may possibly also be quickly
unloaded after the operation is completed if there's no
reason to keep it in memory thereafter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The dot
(&quot;&acirc;&quot;) uses color on supported terminals to
summarize the unit state at a glance. Along with its color,
its shape varies according to its state:
&quot;inactive&quot; or &quot;maintenance&quot; is a white
circle (&quot;&acirc;&quot;), &quot;active&quot; is a green
dot (&quot;&acirc;&quot;), &quot;deactivating&quot; is a
white dot, &quot;failed&quot; or &quot;error&quot; is a red
cross (&quot;&times;&quot;), and &quot;reloading&quot; is a
green clockwise circle arrow
(&quot;&acirc;&raquo;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Loaded:&quot; line in the output will show
&quot;loaded&quot; if the unit has been loaded into memory.
Other possible values for &quot;Loaded:&quot; include:
&quot;error&quot; if there was a problem loading it,
&quot;not&minus;found&quot; if no unit file was found for
this unit, &quot;bad&minus;setting&quot; if an essential
unit file setting could not be parsed and &quot;masked&quot;
if the unit file has been masked. Along with showing the
path to the unit file, this line will also show the
enablement state. Enabled units are included in the
dependency network between units, and thus are started at
boot or via some other form of activation. See the full
table of possible enablement states &mdash; including the
definition of &quot;masked&quot; &mdash; in the
documentation for the <b>is&minus;enabled</b> command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;Active:&quot; line shows active state. The value is
usually &quot;active&quot; or &quot;inactive&quot;. Active
could mean started, bound, plugged in, etc depending on the
unit type. The unit could also be in process of changing
states, reporting a state of &quot;activating&quot; or
&quot;deactivating&quot;. A special &quot;failed&quot; state
is entered when the service failed in some way, such as a
crash, exiting with an error code or timing out. If the
failed state is entered the cause will be logged for later
reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>show</b>
[<i>PATTERN</i>...|<i>JOB</i>...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show properties of one or more
units, jobs, or the manager itself. If no argument is
specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If a
unit name is specified, properties of the unit are shown,
and if a job ID is specified, properties of the job are
shown. By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use
<b>&minus;&minus;all</b> to show those too. To select
specific properties to show, use
<b>&minus;&minus;property=</b>. This command is intended to
be used whenever computer&minus;parsable output is required.
Use <b>status</b> if you are looking for formatted
human&minus;readable output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Many properties
shown by <b>systemctl show</b> map directly to configuration
settings of the system and service manager and its unit
files. Note that the properties shown by the command are
generally more low&minus;level, normalized versions of the
original configuration settings and expose runtime state in
addition to configuration. For example, properties shown for
service units include the service's current main process
identifier as &quot;MainPID&quot; (which is runtime state),
and time settings are always exposed as properties ending in
the &quot;...USec&quot; suffix even if a matching
configuration options end in &quot;...Sec&quot;, because
microseconds is the normalized time unit used internally by
the system and service manager.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For details
about many of these properties, see the documentation of the
D&minus;Bus interface backing these properties, see
<b>org.freedesktop.systemd1</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>cat</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show backing files of one or
more units. Prints the &quot;fragment&quot; and
&quot;drop&minus;ins&quot; (source files) of units. Each
file is preceded by a comment which includes the file name.
Note that this shows the contents of the backing files on
disk, which may not match the system manager's understanding
of these units if any unit files were updated on disk and
the <b>daemon&minus;reload</b> command wasn't issued
since.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>help</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...|</b><i>PID</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show manual pages for one or
more units, if available. If a PID is given, the manual
pages for the unit the process belongs to are shown.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>list&minus;dependencies</b>
[<i>UNIT</i>...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Shows units required and wanted
by the specified units. This recursively lists units
following the <i>Requires=</i>, <i>Requisite=</i>,
<i>ConsistsOf=</i>, <i>Wants=</i>, <i>BindsTo=</i>
dependencies. If no units are specified, default.target is
implied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The units that
are shown are additionally filtered by
<b>&minus;&minus;type=</b> and <b>&minus;&minus;state=</b>
if those options are specified. Note that we won't be able
to use a tree structure in this case, so
<b>&minus;&minus;plain</b> is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
only target units are recursively expanded. When
<b>&minus;&minus;all</b> is passed, all other units are
recursively expanded as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Options
<b>&minus;&minus;reverse</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;after</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;before</b> may be used to change what types
of dependencies are shown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
command only lists units currently loaded into memory by the
service manager. In particular, this command is not suitable
to get a comprehensive list at all reverse dependencies on a
specific unit, as it won't list the dependencies declared by
units currently not loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>start</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Start (activate) one or more
units specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that unit
glob patterns expand to names of units currently in memory.
Units which are not active and are not in a failed state
usually are not in memory, and will not be matched by any
pattern. In addition, in case of instantiated units, systemd
is often unaware of the instance name until the instance has
been started. Therefore, using glob patterns with
<b>start</b> has limited usefulness. Also, secondary alias
names of units are not considered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Option
<b>&minus;&minus;all</b> may be used to also operate on
inactive units which are referenced by other loaded units.
Note that this is not the same as operating on
&quot;all&quot; possible units, because as the previous
paragraph describes, such a list is ill&minus;defined.
Nevertheless, <b>systemctl start &minus;&minus;all</b>
<i>GLOB</i> may be useful if all the units that should match
the pattern are pulled in by some target which is known to
be loaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>stop</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stop (deactivate) one or more
units specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
will fail if the unit does not exist or if stopping of the
unit is prohibited (see <i>RefuseManualStop=</i> in
<b>systemd.unit</b>(5)). It will <i>not</i> fail if any of
the commands configured to stop the unit (<i>ExecStop=</i>,
etc.) fail, because the manager will still forcibly
terminate the unit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reload</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Asks all units listed on the
command line to reload their configuration. Note that this
will reload the service&minus;specific configuration, not
the unit configuration file of systemd. If you want systemd
to reload the configuration file of a unit, use the
<b>daemon&minus;reload</b> command. In other words: for the
example case of Apache, this will reload Apache's httpd.conf
in the web server, not the apache.service systemd unit
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
should not be confused with the <b>daemon&minus;reload</b>
command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>restart</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stop and then start one or more
units specified on the command line. If the units are not
running yet, they will be started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
restarting a unit with this command does not necessarily
flush out all of the unit's resources before it is started
again. For example, the per&minus;service file descriptor
storage facility (see <i>FileDescriptorStoreMax=</i> in
<b>systemd.service</b>(5)) will remain intact as long as the
unit has a job pending, and is only cleared when the unit is
fully stopped and no jobs are pending anymore. If it is
intended that the file descriptor store is flushed out, too,
during a restart operation an explicit <b>systemctl stop</b>
command followed by <b>systemctl start</b> should be
issued.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>try&minus;restart</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stop and then start one or more
units specified on the command line if the units are
running. This does nothing if units are not running.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reload&minus;or&minus;restart</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reload one or more units if
they support it. If not, stop and then start them instead.
If the units are not running yet, they will be started.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>try&minus;reload&minus;or&minus;restart</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reload one or more units if
they support it. If not, stop and then start them instead.
This does nothing if the units are not running.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>isolate</b>
<i>UNIT</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Start the unit specified on the
command line and its dependencies and stop all others,
unless they have <b>IgnoreOnIsolate=yes</b> (see
<b>systemd.unit</b>(5)). If a unit name with no extension is
given, an extension of &quot;.target&quot; will be
assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
dangerous, since it will immediately stop processes that are
not enabled in the new target, possibly including the
graphical environment or terminal you are currently
using.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
operation is allowed only on units where
<b>AllowIsolate=</b> is enabled. See <b>systemd.unit</b>(5)
for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>kill</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Send a signal to one or more
processes of the unit. Use
<b>&minus;&minus;kill&minus;whom=</b> to select which
process to kill. Use <b>&minus;&minus;signal=</b> to select
the signal to send.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>clean</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove the configuration,
state, cache, logs or runtime data of the specified units.
Use <b>&minus;&minus;what=</b> to select which kind of
resource to remove. For service units this may be used to
remove the directories configured with
<i>ConfigurationDirectory=</i>, <i>StateDirectory=</i>,
<i>CacheDirectory=</i>, <i>LogsDirectory=</i> and
<i>RuntimeDirectory=</i>, see <b>systemd.exec</b>(5) for
details. For timer units this may be used to clear out the
persistent timestamp data if <i>Persistent=</i> is used and
<b>&minus;&minus;what=state</b> is selected, see
<b>systemd.timer</b>(5). This command only applies to units
that use either of these settings. If
<b>&minus;&minus;what=</b> is not specified, both the cache
and runtime data are removed (as these two types of data are
generally redundant and reproducible on the next invocation
of the unit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>freeze</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Freeze one or more units
specified on the command line using cgroup freezer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Freezing the
unit will cause all processes contained within the cgroup
corresponding to the unit to be suspended. Being suspended
means that unit's processes won't be scheduled to run on CPU
until thawed. Note that this command is supported only on
systems that use unified cgroup hierarchy. Unit is
automatically thawed just before we execute a job against
the unit, e.g. before the unit is stopped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>thaw</b>
<i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Thaw (unfreeze) one or more
units specified on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
inverse operation to the <b>freeze</b> command and resumes
the execution of processes in the unit's cgroup.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>set&minus;property</b>
<i>UNIT PROPERTY</i><b>=</b><i>VALUE</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the specified unit
properties at runtime where this is supported. This allows
changing configuration parameter properties such as resource
control settings at runtime. Not all properties may be
changed at runtime, but many resource control settings
(primarily those in <b>systemd.resource-control</b>(5)) may.
The changes are applied immediately, and stored on disk for
future boots, unless <b>&minus;&minus;runtime</b> is passed,
in which case the settings only apply until the next reboot.
The syntax of the property assignment follows closely the
syntax of assignments in unit files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
<b>systemctl set&minus;property foobar.service
CPUWeight=200</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the
specified unit appears to be inactive, the changes will be
only stored on disk as described previously hence they will
be effective when the unit will be started.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
command allows changing multiple properties at the same
time, which is preferable over setting them
individually.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
<b>systemctl set&minus;property foobar.service CPUWeight=200
MemoryMax=2G IPAccounting=yes</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Like with unit
file configuration settings, assigning an empty setting
usually resets a property to its defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:
<b>systemctl set&minus;property avahi&minus;daemon.service
IPAddressDeny=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bind</b>
<i>UNIT PATH</i> [<i>PATH</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Bind&minus;mounts a file or
directory from the host into the specified unit's mount
namespace. The first path argument is the source file or
directory on the host, the second path argument is the
destination file or directory in the unit's mount namespace.
When the latter is omitted, the destination path in the
unit's mount namespace is the same as the source path on the
host. When combined with the
<b>&minus;&minus;read&minus;only</b> switch, a
ready&minus;only bind mount is created. When combined with
the <b>&minus;&minus;mkdir</b> switch, the destination path
is first created before the mount is applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
option is currently only supported for units that run within
a mount namespace (e.g.: with <b>RootImage=</b>,
<b>PrivateMounts=</b>, etc.). This command supports
bind&minus;mounting directories, regular files, device
nodes, <b>AF_UNIX</b> socket nodes, as well as FIFOs. The
bind mount is ephemeral, and it is undone as soon as the
current unit process exists. Note that the namespace
mentioned here, where the bind mount will be added to, is
the one where the main service process runs. Other processes
(those exececuted by <b>ExecReload=</b>,

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mount&minus;image</b>
<i>UNIT IMAGE</i> [<i>PATH</i>
[<i>PARTITION_NAME</i>:<i>MOUNT_OPTIONS</i>]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mounts an image from the host
into the specified unit's mount namespace. The first path
argument is the source image on the host, the second path
argument is the destination directory in the unit's mount
namespace (i.e. inside
<b>RootImage=</b>/<b>RootDirectory=</b>). The following
argument, if any, is interpreted as a colon&minus;separated
tuple of partition name and comma&minus;separated list of
mount options for that partition. The format is the same as
the service <b>MountImages=</b> setting. When combined with
the <b>&minus;&minus;read&minus;only</b> switch, a
ready&minus;only mount is created. When combined with the
<b>&minus;&minus;mkdir</b> switch, the destination path is
first created before the mount is applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
option is currently only supported for units that run within
a mount namespace (i.e. with <b>RootImage=</b>,
<b>PrivateMounts=</b>, etc.). Note that the namespace
mentioned here where the image mount will be added to, is
the one where the main service process runs. Note that the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>service&minus;log&minus;level</b>
<i>SERVICE</i> [<i>LEVEL</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the <i>LEVEL</i> argument is

service <i>SERVICE</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the optional
argument <i>LEVEL</i> is provided, then change the current
log level of the service to <i>LEVEL</i>. The log level
should be a typical syslog log level, i.e. a value in the
range 0...7 or one of the strings <b>emerg</b>,
<b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>,
<b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>; see
<b>syslog</b>(3) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The service

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>service&minus;log&minus;target</b>
<i>SERVICE</i> [<i>TARGET</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If the <i>TARGET</i> argument

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the optional
argument <i>TARGET</i> is provided, then change the current

should be one of the strings <b>console</b> (for log output
to the service's standard error stream), <b>kmsg</b> (for
log output to the kernel log buffer), <b>journal</b> (for
log output to <b>systemd-journald.service</b>(8) using the
native journal protocol), <b>syslog</b> (for log output to
the classic syslog socket /dev/log), <b>null</b> (for no log
output whatsoever) or <b>auto</b> (for an automatically
determined choice, typically equivalent to <b>console</b> if
the service is invoked interactively, and <b>journal</b> or
<b>syslog</b> otherwise).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For most
services, only a small subset of log targets make sense. In
particular, most &quot;normal&quot; services should only
implement <b>console</b>, <b>journal</b>, and <b>null</b>.
Anything else is only appropriate for low&minus;level
services that are active in very early boot before proper
logging is established.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The service
must have the appropriate <i>BusName=destination</i>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>reset&minus;failed
[</b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reset the &quot;failed&quot;
state of the specified units, or if no unit name is passed,
reset the state of all units. When a unit fails in some way
(i.e. process exiting with non&minus;zero error code,
terminating abnormally or timing out), it will automatically
enter the &quot;failed&quot; state and its exit code and
status is recorded for introspection by the administrator
until the service is stopped/re&minus;started or reset with
this command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
resetting the &quot;failed&quot; state of a unit it also
resets various other per&minus;unit properties: the start
rate limit counter of all unit types is reset to zero, as is
the restart counter of service units. Thus, if a unit's
start limit (as configured with
<i>StartLimitIntervalSec=</i>/<i>StartLimitBurst=</i>) is
hit and the unit refuses to be started again, use this
command to make it startable again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unit File
Commands <br>
list&minus;unit&minus;files</b> [<i>PATTERN...</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List unit files installed on
the system, in combination with their enablement state (as
reported by <b>is&minus;enabled</b>). If one or more
<i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only unit files whose name
matches one of them are shown (patterns matching unit file
system paths are not supported).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike
<b>list&minus;units</b> this command will list template
units in addition to explicitly instantiated units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>enable</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>, <b>enable</b>
<i>PATH</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable one or more units or
unit instances. This will create a set of symlinks, as
encoded in the [Install] sections of the indicated unit
files. After the symlinks have been created, the system
manager configuration is reloaded (in a way equivalent to
<b>daemon&minus;reload</b>), in order to ensure the changes
are taken into account immediately. Note that this does
<i>not</i> have the effect of also starting any of the units
being enabled. If this is desired, combine this command with
the <b>&minus;&minus;now</b> switch, or invoke <b>start</b>
with appropriate arguments later. Note that in case of unit
instance enablement (i.e. enablement of units of the form
foo@bar.service), symlinks named the same as instances are
created in the unit configuration directory, however they
point to the single template unit file they are instantiated
from.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
expects either valid unit names (in which case various unit
file directories are automatically searched for unit files
with appropriate names), or absolute paths to unit files (in
which case these files are read directly). If a specified
unit file is located outside of the usual unit file
directories, an additional symlink is created, linking it
into the unit configuration path, thus ensuring it is found
when requested by commands such as <b>start</b>. The file
system where the linked unit files are located must be
accessible when systemd is started (e.g. anything underneath
/home/ or /var/ is not allowed, unless those directories are
located on the root file system).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
will print the file system operations executed. This output
may be suppressed by passing <b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
operation creates only the symlinks suggested in the
[Install] section of the unit files. While this command is
the recommended way to manipulate the unit configuration
directory, the administrator is free to make additional
changes manually by placing or removing symlinks below this
directory. This is particularly useful to create
configurations that deviate from the suggested default
installation. In this case, the administrator must make sure
to invoke <b>daemon&minus;reload</b> manually as necessary,
in order to ensure the changes are taken into account.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When using this
operation on units without install information, a warning
about it is shown. <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;warn</b> can be
used to suppress the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Enabling units
should not be confused with starting (activating) units, as
done by the <b>start</b> command. Enabling and starting
units is orthogonal: units may be enabled without being
started and started without being enabled. Enabling simply
hooks the unit into various suggested places (for example,
so that the unit is automatically started on boot or when a
particular kind of hardware is plugged in). Starting
actually spawns the daemon process (in case of service
units), or binds the socket (in case of socket units), and
so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Depending on
whether <b>&minus;&minus;system</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;user</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;runtime</b>, or
<b>&minus;&minus;global</b> is specified, this enables the
unit for the system, for the calling user only, for only
this boot of the system, or for all future logins of all
users. Note that in the last case, no systemd daemon
configuration is reloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using
<b>enable</b> on masked units is not supported and results
in an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>disable</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Disables one or more units.
This removes all symlinks to the unit files backing the
specified units from the unit configuration directory, and
hence undoes any changes made by <b>enable</b> or
<b>link</b>. Note that this removes <i>all</i> symlinks to
matching unit files, including manually created symlinks,
and not just those actually created by <b>enable</b> or
<b>link</b>. Note that while <b>disable</b> undoes the
effect of <b>enable</b>, the two commands are otherwise not
symmetric, as <b>disable</b> may remove more symlinks than a
prior <b>enable</b> invocation of the same unit created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
implicitly reloads the system manager configuration after
completing the operation. Note that this command does not
implicitly stop the units that are being disabled. If this

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reenable one or more units, as
specified on the command line. This is a combination of
<b>disable</b> and <b>enable</b> and is useful to reset the
symlinks a unit file is enabled with to the defaults
configured in its [Install] section. This command expects a
unit name only, it does not accept paths to unit files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>preset</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reset the enable/disable status
one or more unit files, as specified on the command line, to

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>mask</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Mask one or more units, as
specified on the command line. This will link these unit
files to /dev/null, making it impossible to start them. This
is a stronger version of <b>disable</b>, since it prohibits
all kinds of activation of the unit, including enablement
and manual activation. Use this option with care. This
honors the <b>&minus;&minus;runtime</b> option to only mask
temporarily until the next reboot of the system. The
<b>&minus;&minus;now</b> option may be used to ensure that
the units are also stopped. This command expects valid unit
names only, it does not accept unit file paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>unmask</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Unmask one or more unit files,

it does not accept unit file paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>link</b>
<i>PATH</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Link a unit file that is not in
the unit file search path into the unit file search path.
This command expects an absolute path to a unit file. The
effect of this may be undone with <b>disable</b>. The effect
of this command is that a unit file is made available for
commands such as <b>start</b>, even though it is not
installed directly in the unit search path. The file system
where the linked unit files are located must be accessible
when systemd is started (e.g. anything underneath /home/ or
/var/ is not allowed, unless those directories are located
on the root file system).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>revert</b>
<i>UNIT</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Revert one or more unit files
to their vendor versions. This command removes drop&minus;in
configuration files that modify the specified units, as well
as any user&minus;configured unit file that overrides a
matching vendor supplied unit file. Specifically, for a unit
&quot;foo.service&quot; the matching directories
&quot;foo.service.d/&quot; with all their contained files
are removed, both below the persistent and runtime
configuration directories (i.e. below /etc/systemd/system
and /run/systemd/system); if the unit file has a
vendor&minus;supplied version (i.e. a unit file located
below /usr/) any matching persistent or runtime unit file
that overrides it is removed, too. Note that if a unit file
has no vendor&minus;supplied version (i.e. is only defined
below /etc/systemd/system or /run/systemd/system, but not in
a unit file stored below /usr/), then it is not removed.
Also, if a unit is masked, it is unmasked.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Effectively,
this command may be used to undo all changes made with

Variable names cannot be empty or start with a digit. In
variable values, most characters are allowed, but the whole
sequence must be valid UTF&minus;8. (Note that control
characters like newline (<b>NL</b>), tab (<b>TAB</b>), or
the escape character (<b>ESC</b>), <i>are</i> valid ASCII
and thus valid UTF&minus;8). The total length of the
environment block is limited to <b>_SC_ARG_MAX</b> value
defined by <b>sysconf</b>(3).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>show&minus;environment</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Dump the systemd manager
environment block. This is the environment block that is
passed to all processes the manager spawns. The environment
block will be dumped in straightforward form suitable for
sourcing into most shells. If no special characters or
whitespace is present in the variable values, no escaping is
performed, and the assignments have the form
&quot;VARIABLE=value&quot;. If whitespace or characters
which have special meaning to the shell are present,
dollar&minus;single&minus;quote escaping is used, and
assignments have the form &quot;VARIABLE=$'value'&quot;.

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>set&minus;environment</b>
<i>VARIABLE=VALUE</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set one or more systemd manager
environment variables, as specified on the command line.
This command will fail if variable names and values do not
conform to the rules listed above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>unset&minus;environment</b>
<i>VARIABLE</i><b>...</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Unset one or more systemd
manager environment variables. If only a variable name is
specified, it will be removed regardless of its value. If a
variable and a value are specified, the variable is only
removed if it has the specified value.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>import&minus;environment</b>
<i>VARIABLE...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Import all, one or more
environment variables set on the client into the systemd
manager environment block. If a list of environment variable
names is passed, client&minus;side values are then imported
into the manager's environment block. If any names are not
valid environment variable names or have invalid values
according to the rules described above, an error is raised.
If no arguments are passed, the entire environment block
inherited by the <b>systemctl</b> process is imported. In
this mode, any inherited invalid environment variables are
quietly ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Importing of
the full inherited environment block (calling this command
without any arguments) is deprecated. A shell will set
dozens of variables which only make sense locally and are
only meant for processes which are descendants of the shell.
Such variables in the global environment block are confusing
to other processes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Manager
State Commands <br>
daemon&minus;reload</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reload the systemd manager
configuration. This will rerun all generators (see
<b>systemd.generator</b>(7)), reload all unit files, and
recreate the entire dependency tree. While the daemon is
being reloaded, all sockets systemd listens on behalf of
user configuration will stay accessible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This command
should not be confused with the <b>reload</b> command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>daemon&minus;reexec</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reexecute the systemd manager.
This will serialize the manager state, reexecute the process
and deserialize the state again. This command is of little
use except for debugging and package upgrades. Sometimes, it
might be helpful as a heavy&minus;weight
<b>daemon&minus;reload</b>. While the daemon is being
reexecuted, all sockets systemd listening on behalf of user
configuration will stay accessible.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>log&minus;level</b>
[<i>LEVEL</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If no argument is given, print
the current log level of the manager. If an optional
argument <i>LEVEL</i> is provided, then the command changes
the current log level of the manager to <i>LEVEL</i>
(accepts the same values as
<b>&minus;&minus;log&minus;level=</b> described in
<b>systemd</b>(1)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>log&minus;target</b>
[<i>TARGET</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If no argument is given, print
the current log target of the manager. If an optional
argument <i>TARGET</i> is provided, then the command changes
the current log target of the manager to <i>TARGET</i>
(accepts the same values as
<b>&minus;&minus;log&minus;target=</b>, described in
<b>systemd</b>(1)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>service&minus;watchdogs</b>
[yes|no]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If no argument is given, print
the current state of service runtime watchdogs of the
manager. If an optional boolean argument is provided, then
globally enables or disables the service runtime watchdogs
(<b>WatchdogSec=</b>) and emergency actions (e.g.
<b>OnFailure=</b> or <b>StartLimitAction=</b>); see
<b>systemd.service</b>(5). The hardware watchdog is not
affected by this setting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>System
Commands <br>
is&minus;system&minus;running</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Checks whether the system is
operational. This returns success (exit code 0) when the
system is fully up and running, specifically not in startup,
shutdown or maintenance mode, and with no failed services.
Failure is returned otherwise (exit code non&minus;zero). In
addition, the current state is printed in a short string to
standard output, see the table below. Use
<b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b> to suppress this output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>&minus;&minus;wait</b> to wait until the boot process is
completed before printing the current state and returning
the appropriate error status. If <b>&minus;&minus;wait</b>
is in use, states <i>initializing</i> or <i>starting</i>
will not be reported, instead the command will block until a

<i>ROOT</i> [<i>INIT</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Switches to a different root
directory and executes a new system manager process below
it. This is intended for use in the initrd, and will
transition from the initrd's system manager process (a.k.a.
&quot;init&quot; process) to the main system manager process
which is loaded from the actual host root files system. This
call takes two arguments: the directory that is to become
the new root directory, and the path to the new system
manager binary below it to execute as PID 1. If the latter
is omitted or the empty string, a systemd binary will
automatically be searched for and used as init. If the
system manager path is omitted, equal to the empty string or
identical to the path to the systemd binary, the state of
the initrd's system manager process is passed to the main
system manager, which allows later introspection of the
state of the services involved in the initrd boot phase.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>suspend</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suspend the system. This will

It will not wait for the suspend/resume cycle to
complete.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hibernate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Hibernate the system. This will
trigger activation of the special target unit
hibernate.target. This command is asynchronous, and will
return after the hibernation operation is successfully
enqueued. It will not wait for the hibernate/thaw cycle to
complete.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hybrid&minus;sleep</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Hibernate and suspend the

asynchronous, and will return after the hybrid sleep
operation is successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the
sleep/wake&minus;up cycle to complete.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>suspend&minus;then&minus;hibernate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suspend the system and
hibernate it after the delay specified in
systemd&minus;sleep.conf. This will trigger activation of
the special target unit
suspend&minus;then&minus;hibernate.target. This command is
asynchronous, and will return after the hybrid sleep
operation is successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the
sleep/wake&minus;up or hibernate/thaw cycle to complete.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Parameter
Syntax</b> <br>
Unit commands listed above take either a single unit name
(designated as <i>UNIT</i>), or multiple unit specifications
(designated as <i>PATTERN</i>...). In the first case, the
unit name with or without a suffix must be given. If the
suffix is not specified (unit name is
&quot;abbreviated&quot;), systemctl will append a suitable
suffix, &quot;.service&quot; by default, and a
type&minus;specific suffix in case of commands which operate
only on specific unit types. For example,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
start sshd</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
start sshd.service</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">are equivalent,
as are</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
isolate default</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
isolate default.target</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
(absolute) paths to device nodes are automatically converted
to device unit names, and other (absolute) paths to mount
unit names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
status /dev/sda <br>
# systemctl status /home</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">are equivalent
to:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
status dev&minus;sda.device <br>
# systemctl status home.mount</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the second
case, shell&minus;style globs will be matched against the
primary names of all units currently in memory; literal unit
names, with or without a suffix, will be treated as in the
first case. This means that literal unit names always refer
to exactly one unit, but globs may match zero units and this
is not considered an error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Glob patterns
use <b>fnmatch</b>(3), so normal shell&minus;style globbing
rules are used, and &quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot;,
&quot;[]&quot; may be used. See <b>glob</b>(7) for more
details. The patterns are matched against the primary names
of units currently in memory, and patterns which do not
match anything are silently skipped. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
stop sshd@*.service</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">will stop all
sshd@.service instances. Note that alias names of units, and
units that aren't in memory are not considered for glob
expansion.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For unit file
commands, the specified <i>UNIT</i> should be the name of
the unit file (possibly abbreviated, see above), or the
absolute path to the unit file:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl
enable foo.service</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># systemctl

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are understood:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;t</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;type=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The argument is a
comma&minus;separated list of unit types such as
<b>service</b> and <b>socket</b>. When units are listed with
<b>list&minus;units</b>, <b>list&minus;dependencies</b>,
<b>show</b>, or <b>status</b>, only units of the specified

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;state=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The argument is a
comma&minus;separated list of unit LOAD, SUB, or ACTIVE
states. When listing units with <b>list&minus;units</b>,
<b>list&minus;dependencies</b>, <b>show</b> or
<b>status</b>, show only those in the specified states. Use

exit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;p</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;property=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When showing unit/job/manager
properties with the <b>show</b> command, limit display to
properties specified in the argument. The argument should be
a comma&minus;separated list of property names, such as
&quot;MainPID&quot;. Unless specified, all known properties
are shown. If specified more than once, all properties with
the specified names are shown. Shell completion is
implemented for property names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For the manager
itself, <b>systemctl&nbsp;show</b> will show all available
properties, most of which are derived or closely match the
options described in <b>systemd-system.conf</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Properties for
units vary by unit type, so showing any unit (even a
non&minus;existent one) is a way to list properties
pertaining to this type. Similarly, showing any job will
list properties pertaining to all jobs. Properties for units
are documented in <b>systemd.unit</b>(5), and the pages for
individual unit types <b>systemd.service</b>(5),
<b>systemd.socket</b>(5), etc.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;P</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Equivalent to
<b>&minus;&minus;value &minus;&minus;property=</b>, i.e.
shows the value of the property without the property name or
&quot;=&quot;. Note that using <b>&minus;P</b> once will
also affect all properties listed with
<b>&minus;p</b>/<b>&minus;&minus;property=</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;a</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When listing units with
<b>list&minus;units</b>, also show inactive units and units
which are following other units. When showing
unit/job/manager properties, show all properties regardless
whether they are set or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To list all
units installed in the file system, use the
<b>list&minus;unit&minus;files</b> command instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When listing
units with <b>list&minus;dependencies</b>, recursively show
dependencies of all dependent units (by default only
dependencies of target units are shown).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
<b>status</b>, show journal messages in full, even if they
include unprintable characters or are very long. By default,
fields with unprintable characters are abbreviated as
&quot;blob data&quot;. (Note that the pager may escape
unprintable characters again.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;r</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;recursive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When listing units, also show
units of local containers. Units of local containers will be
prefixed with the container name, separated by a single
colon character (&quot;:&quot;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;reverse</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show reverse dependencies
between units with <b>list&minus;dependencies</b>, i.e.
follow dependencies of type <i>WantedBy=</i>,
<i>RequiredBy=</i>, <i>PartOf=</i>, <i>BoundBy=</i>, instead
of <i>Wants=</i> and similar.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;after</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With
<b>list&minus;dependencies</b>, show the units that are
ordered before the specified unit. In other words,
recursively list units following the <i>After=</i>
dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that any
<i>After=</i> dependency is automatically mirrored to create
a <i>Before=</i> dependency. Temporal dependencies may be
specified explicitly, but are also created implicitly for
units which are <i>WantedBy=</i> targets (see
<b>systemd.target</b>(5)), and as a result of other
directives (for example <i>RequiresMountsFor=</i>). Both
explicitly and implicitly introduced dependencies are shown
with <b>list&minus;dependencies</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When passed to
the <b>list&minus;jobs</b> command, for each printed job
show which other jobs are waiting for it. May be combined
with <b>&minus;&minus;before</b> to show both the jobs
waiting for each job as well as all jobs each job is waiting
for.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;before</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">With
<b>list&minus;dependencies</b>, show the units that are
ordered after the specified unit. In other words,
recursively list units following the <i>Before=</i>
dependency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When passed to
the <b>list&minus;jobs</b> command, for each printed job
show which other jobs it is waiting for. May be combined
with <b>&minus;&minus;after</b> to show both the jobs
waiting for each job as well as all jobs each job is waiting
for.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;with&minus;dependencies</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>status</b>,
<b>cat</b>, <b>list&minus;units</b>, and
<b>list&minus;unit&minus;files</b>, those commands print all
specified units and the dependencies of those units.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Options
<b>&minus;&minus;reverse</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;after</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;before</b> may be used to change what types
of dependencies are shown.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;l</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;full</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not ellipsize unit names,
process tree entries, journal output, or truncate unit

<b>list&minus;units</b>, <b>list&minus;jobs</b>, and
<b>list&minus;timers</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also, show
installation targets in the output of
<b>is&minus;enabled</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;value</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When printing properties with
<b>show</b>, only print the value, and skip the property
name and &quot;=&quot;. Also see option <b>&minus;P</b>
above.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;types</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When showing sockets, show the
type of the socket.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;job&minus;mode=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When queuing a new job, this
option controls how to deal with already queued jobs. It
takes one of &quot;fail&quot;, &quot;replace&quot;,
&quot;replace&minus;irreversibly&quot;, &quot;isolate&quot;,
&quot;ignore&minus;dependencies&quot;,
&quot;ignore&minus;requirements&quot;, &quot;flush&quot;, or
&quot;triggering&quot;. Defaults to &quot;replace&quot;,
except when the <b>isolate</b> command is used which implies
the &quot;isolate&quot; job mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;fail&quot; is specified and a requested operation
conflicts with a pending job (more specifically: causes an
already pending start job to be reversed into a stop job or
vice versa), cause the operation to fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;replace&quot; (the default) is specified, any
conflicting pending job will be replaced, as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;replace&minus;irreversibly&quot; is specified, operate
like &quot;replace&quot;, but also mark the new jobs as
irreversible. This prevents future conflicting transactions
from replacing these jobs (or even being enqueued while the
irreversible jobs are still pending). Irreversible jobs can
still be cancelled using the <b>cancel</b> command. This job

covering both the requested job and any added because of
unit dependencies. Note that the output will only include
jobs immediately part of the transaction requested. It is
possible that service start&minus;up program code run as
effect of the enqueued jobs might request further jobs to be
pulled in. This means that completion of the listed jobs
might ultimately entail more jobs than the listed ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;check&minus;inhibitors=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When system shutdown or sleep
state is requested, this option controls checking of
inhibitor locks. It takes one of &quot;auto&quot;,
&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. Defaults to
&quot;auto&quot;, which will behave like &quot;yes&quot; for
interactive invocations (i.e. from a TTY) and &quot;no&quot;
for non&minus;interactive invocations. &quot;yes&quot; lets
the request respect inhibitor locks. &quot;no&quot; lets the
request ignore inhibitor locks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Applications
can establish inhibitor locks to prevent certain important
operations (such as CD burning) from being interrupted by
system shutdown or sleep. Any user may take these locks and
privileged users may override these locks. If any locks are
taken, shutdown and sleep state requests will normally fail
(unless privileged). However, if &quot;no&quot; is specified
or &quot;auto&quot; is specified on a non&minus;interactive
requests, the operation will be attempted. If locks are
present, the operation may require additional
privileges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Option

(like <b>show</b>). Errors are always printed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;warn</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Don't generate the warnings

[Install] section).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;block</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not synchronously wait for
the requested operation to finish. If this is not specified,
the job will be verified, enqueued and <b>systemctl</b> will
wait until the unit's start&minus;up is completed. By
passing this argument, it is only verified and enqueued.
This option may not be combined with
<b>&minus;&minus;wait</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;wait</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Synchronously wait for started
units to terminate again. This option may not be combined
with <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;block</b>. Note that this
will wait forever if any given unit never terminates (by
itself or by getting stopped explicitly); particularly
services which use &quot;RemainAfterExit=yes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;global</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>enable</b>

directory, thus enabling or disabling a unit file globally
for all future logins of all users.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;reload</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>enable</b>

configuration after executing the changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;ask&minus;password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>start</b> and
related commands, disables asking for passwords. Background
services may require input of a password or passphrase
string, for example to unlock system hard disks or
cryptographic certificates. Unless this option is specified
and the command is invoked from a terminal, <b>systemctl</b>
will query the user on the terminal for the necessary
secrets. Use this option to switch this behavior off. In
this case, the password must be supplied by some other means
(for example graphical password agents) or the service might
fail. This also disables querying the user for
authentication for privileged operations.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;kill&minus;whom=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>kill</b>,
choose which processes to send a signal to. Must be one of
<b>main</b>, <b>control</b> or <b>all</b> to select whether
to kill only the main process, the control process or all
processes of the unit. The main process of the unit is the
one that defines the life&minus;time of it. A control
process of a unit is one that is invoked by the manager to
induce state changes of it. For example, all processes
started due to the <i>ExecStartPre=</i>, <i>ExecStop=</i> or
<i>ExecReload=</i> settings of service units are control
processes. Note that there is only one control process per
unit at a time, as only one state change is executed at a
time. For services of type <i>Type=forking</i>, the initial
process started by the manager for <i>ExecStart=</i> is a
control process, while the process ultimately forked off by
that one is then considered the main process of the unit (if
it can be determined). This is different for service units
of other types, where the process forked off by the manager
for <i>ExecStart=</i> is always the main process itself. A
service unit consists of zero or one main process, zero or
one control process plus any number of additional processes.
Not all unit types manage processes of these types however.
For example, for mount units, control processes are defined
(which are the invocations of /usr/bin/mount and
/usr/bin/umount), but no main process is defined. If
omitted, defaults to <b>all</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;s</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;signal=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>kill</b>,
choose which signal to send to selected processes. Must be
one of the well&minus;known signal specifiers such as
<b>SIGTERM</b>, <b>SIGINT</b> or <b>SIGSTOP</b>. If omitted,
defaults to <b>SIGTERM</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The special
value &quot;help&quot; will list the known values and the
program will exit immediately, and the special value
&quot;list&quot; will list known values along with the
numerical signal numbers and the program will exit
immediately.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;what=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Select what type of
per&minus;unit resources to remove when the <b>clean</b>
command is invoked, see below. Takes one of
<b>configuration</b>, <b>state</b>, <b>cache</b>,
<b>logs</b>, <b>runtime</b> to select the type of resource.
This option may be specified more than once, in which case
all specified resource types are removed. Also accepts the
special value <b>all</b> as a shortcut for specifying all
five resource types. If this option is not specified
defaults to the combination of <b>cache</b> and
<b>runtime</b>, i.e. the two kinds of resources that are
generally considered to be redundant and can be
reconstructed on next invocation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;f</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;force</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>enable</b>,
overwrite any existing conflicting symlinks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
<b>edit</b>, create all of the specified units which do not
already exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When used with
<b>halt</b>, <b>poweroff</b>, <b>reboot</b> or <b>kexec</b>,
execute the selected operation without shutting down all
units. However, all processes will be killed forcibly and
all file systems are unmounted or remounted read&minus;only.
This is hence a drastic but relatively safe option to
request an immediate reboot. If <b>&minus;&minus;force</b>
is specified twice for these operations (with the exception
of <b>kexec</b>), they will be executed immediately, without
terminating any processes or unmounting any file systems.
Warning: specifying <b>&minus;&minus;force</b> twice with
any of these operations might result in data loss. Note that
when <b>&minus;&minus;force</b> is specified twice the
selected operation is executed by <b>systemctl</b> itself,
and the system manager is not contacted. This means the
command should succeed even when the system manager has
crashed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;message=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>halt</b>,
<b>poweroff</b> or <b>reboot</b>, set a short message
explaining the reason for the operation. The message will be
logged together with the default shutdown message.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;now</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with <b>enable</b>,
the units will also be started. When used with
<b>disable</b> or <b>mask</b>, the units will also be
stopped. The start or stop operation is only carried out
when the respective enable or disable operation has been
successful.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;root=</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When used with
<b>enable</b>/<b>disable</b>/<b>is&minus;enabled</b> (and
related commands), use the specified root path when looking
for unit files. If this option is present, <b>systemctl</b>
will operate on the file system directly, instead of
communicating with the <b>systemd</b> daemon to carry out
changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;image=</b><i>image</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a path to a disk image
file or block device node. If specified, all operations are
applied to file system in the indicated disk image. This
option is similar to <b>&minus;&minus;root=</b>, but
operates on file systems stored in disk images or block
devices. The disk image should either contain just a file
system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition
table, following the <b><font color="#0000FF">Discoverable

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_EDITOR</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Editor to
use when editing units; overrides <i>$EDITOR</i> and
<i>$VISUAL</i>. If neither <i>$SYSTEMD_EDITOR</i> nor
<i>$EDITOR</i> nor <i>$VISUAL</i> are present or if it is
set to an empty string or if their execution failed,
systemctl will try to execute well known editors in this
order: <b>editor</b>(1), <b>nano</b>(1), <b>vim</b>(1),
<b>vi</b>(1).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The
maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a
higher log level, i.e. less important ones, will be
suppressed). Either one of (in order of decreasing
importance) <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>,
<b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>,
<b>debug</b>, or an integer in the range 0...7. See
<b>syslog</b>(3) for more information.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A
boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be
colored according to priority.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
setting is only useful when messages are written directly to
the terminal, because <b>journalctl</b>(1) and other tools
that display logs will color messages based on the log level
on their own.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A
boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with
a timestamp.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">This
setting is only useful when messages are written directly to
the terminal or a file, because <b>journalctl</b>(1) and
other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based
on the entry metadata on their own.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">A
boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename
and line number in the source code where the message
originates.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that the log location is often attached as metadata to
journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging
programs.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The
destination for log messages. One of <b>console</b> (log to
the attached tty), <b>console&minus;prefixed</b> (log to the
attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and
&quot;facility&quot;, see <b>syslog</b>(3), <b>kmsg</b> (log
to the kernel circular log buffer), <b>journal</b> (log to
the journal), <b>journal&minus;or&minus;kmsg</b> (log to the
journal if available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto</b>
(determine the appropriate log target automatically, the
default), <b>null</b> (disable log output).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Pager to
use when <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;pager</b> is not given;
overrides <i>$PAGER</i>. If neither <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i>
nor <i>$PAGER</i> are set, a set of well&minus;known pager
implementations are tried in turn, including <b>less</b>(1)
and <b>more</b>(1), until one is found. If no pager
implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting
this environment variable to an empty string or the value
&quot;cat&quot; is equivalent to passing
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;pager</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note:
if <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set,
<i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> (as well as <i>$PAGER</i>) will be
silently ignored.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Override
the options passed to <b>less</b> (by default
&quot;FRSXMK&quot;).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Users
might want to change two options in particular:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>K</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><font color="#000000">This
option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C
is pressed. To allow <b>less</b> to handle Ctrl+C itself to
switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this
option.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
the value of <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i> does not include
&quot;K&quot;, and the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>,
Ctrl+C will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be
handled by the pager.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>X</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;"><font color="#000000">This
option instructs the pager to not send termcap
initialization and deinitialization strings to the terminal.
It is set by default to allow command output to remain
visible in the terminal even after the pager exits.
Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from
working, in particular paged output cannot be scrolled with
the mouse.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">See
<b>less</b>(1) for more discussion.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Override
the charset passed to <b>less</b> (by default
&quot;utf&minus;8&quot;, if the invoking terminal is
determined to be UTF&minus;8 compatible).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. When true, the &quot;secure&quot; mode of
the pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If
<i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set at all, secure mode
is enabled if the effective UID is not the same as the owner
of the login session, see <b>geteuid</b>(2) and
<b>sd_pid_get_owner_uid</b>(3). In secure mode,
<b>LESSSECURE=1</b> will be set when invoking the pager, and
the pager shall disable commands that open or create new
files or start new subprocesses. When
<i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set at all, pagers which
are not known to implement secure mode will not be used.
(Currently only <b>less</b>(1) implements secure
mode.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note:
when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for
example under <b>sudo</b>(8) or <b>pkexec</b>(1), care must
be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are
not enabled. &quot;Secure&quot; mode for the pager may be
enabled automatically as describe above. Setting
<i>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</i> or not removing it from the
inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary
commands. Note that if the <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> or
<i>$PAGER</i> variables are to be honoured,
<i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> must be set too. It might be
reasonable to completely disable the pager using
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;pager</b> instead.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd</b> and related
utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the
output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can
take one of the following special values: &quot;16&quot;,
&quot;256&quot; to restrict the use of colors to the base 16
or 256 ANSI colors, respectively. This can be specified to
override the automatic decision based on <i>$TERM</i> and
what the console is connected to.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">The value
must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should
be generated in the output for terminal emulators supporting
this. This can be specified to override the decision that
<b>systemd</b> makes based on <i>$TERM</i> and other
conditions.</font></p>
