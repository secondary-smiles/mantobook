PUBLIC LICENSE <br>
Version 1, February 1989 <br>
Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <br>
51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110&minus;1301 USA
<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br>
Preamble <br>
The license agreements of most software companies try to
keep users <br>
at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General
Public <br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
change free <br>
software&minus;&minus;to make sure the software is free for
all its users. The <br>
General Public License applies to the Free Software
Foundation's <br>
software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it. <br>
You can use it for your programs, too. <br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,
not <br>
price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed
to make <br>
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies
of free <br>
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, <br>
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free <br>
programs; and that you know you can do these things. <br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that
forbid <br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
the rights. <br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you <br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. <br>
For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program,
whether <br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the
rights that <br>
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the <br>
source code. And you must tell them their rights. <br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the
software, <br>
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to <br>
copy, distribute and/or modify the software. <br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain <br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
free <br>
software. If the software is modified by someone else and
passed on, <br>
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
the original, <br>
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the <br>
original authors' reputations. <br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
and <br>
modification follow. <br>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE <br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND
MODIFICATION <br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other
work which <br>
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
may be <br>
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.
The <br>
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or
work, and a &quot;work based <br>
on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work
containing the <br>
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications. <br>
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. <br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
Program's <br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you <br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate <br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all
the <br>
notices that refer to this General Public License and to the
absence of <br>
any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a
copy of <br>
this General Public License along with the Program. You may
charge a <br>
fee for the physical act of transferring a copy. <br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any
portion <br>
of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the
terms of <br>
Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:
<br>
a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that <br>
you changed the files and the date of any change; and <br>
b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or
publish, that <br>
in whole or in part contains the Program or any part
thereof, <br>
either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no
charge <br>
to all third parties under the terms of this General Public
License <br>
(except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to
some or <br>
all third parties, at your option). <br>
c) If the modified program normally reads commands
interactively <br>
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
<br>
interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print
or <br>
display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
notice <br>
and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
you <br>
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
program <br>
under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
copy of <br>
this General Public License. <br>
d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
a <br>
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
in <br>
exchange for a fee. <br>
Mere aggregation of another independent work with the
Program (or its <br>
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium
does not <br>
bring the other work under the scope of these terms. <br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or
<br>
derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or
executable form <br>
under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that
you also do <br>
one of the following: <br>
a) accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine&minus;readable <br>
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
<br>
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, <br>
b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
three <br>
years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
charge <br>
for the cost of distribution) a complete
machine&minus;readable copy of <br>
the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
terms of <br>
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, <br>
c) accompany it with the information you received as to
where the <br>
corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative
is <br>
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
<br>
received the program in object code or executable form
alone.) <br>
Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making <br>
modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source
code <br>
means all the source code for all modules it contains; but,
as a <br>
special exception, it need not include source code for
modules which <br>
are standard libraries that accompany the operating system
on which the <br>
executable file runs, or for standard header files or
definitions files <br>
that accompany that operating system. <br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or
transfer the <br>
Program except as expressly provided under this General
Public License. <br>
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
distribute or <br>
transfer the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your <br>
rights to use the Program under this License. However,
parties who <br>
have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you
under this <br>
General Public License will not have their licenses
terminated so long <br>
as such parties remain in full compliance. <br>
5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any
work <br>
based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this
license to <br>
do so, and all its terms and conditions. <br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based
on the <br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the <br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
subject to <br>
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. <br>
7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new <br>
versions of the General Public License from time to time.
Such new <br>
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may <br>
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. <br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Program <br>
specifies a version number of the license which applies to
it and &quot;any <br>
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the
terms and <br>
conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by <br>
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a <br>
version number of the license, you may choose any version
ever <br>
published by the Free Software Foundation. <br>
8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
other free <br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
to the <br>
author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the <br>
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
Foundation; we <br>
sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be
guided by the <br>
two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives
of our free <br>
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
generally. <br>
NO WARRANTY <br>
9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
NO <br>
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. <br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR <br>
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, <br>
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED <br>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. <br>
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS <br>
WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
COST OF <br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br>
10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
TO IN <br>
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
MAY MODIFY <br>
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU <br>
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
USE THE <br>
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING <br>
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A <br>
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF <br>
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH <br>
DAMAGES. <br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br>
Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs <br>
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
greatest <br>
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to
make it <br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change
under these <br>
terms. <br>
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is
safest <br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively <br>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
at least <br>
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the
full notice is found. <br>
&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of
what it <br>
does.&gt; <br>
Copyright (C) 19yy &lt;name of author&gt; <br>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it
and/or <br>
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as <br>
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 1,
or (at <br>
your option) any later version. <br>
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be
useful, <br>
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty
of <br>
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
<br>
GNU General Public License for more details. <br>
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public
License <br>
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
<br>
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston MA
<br>
02110&minus;1301 USA <br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
paper <br>
mail. <br>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice
like this <br>
when it starts in an interactive mode: <br>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
<br>
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type <br>
'show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to <br>
redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c' for
<br>
details. <br>
The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show
the <br>
appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course,
the <br>
commands you use may be called something other than 'show w'
and 'show <br>
c'; they could even be mouse&minus;clicks or menu
items&minus;&minus;whatever suits your <br>
program. <br>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a
programmer) or your <br>
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot;
for the program, if <br>
necessary. Here a sample; alter the names: <br>
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
the <br>
program 'Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make
passes <br>
at assemblers) written by James Hacker. <br>
