[ <i>options</i> ] [ <i>filename</i> ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>jpegtran</b>
performs various useful transformations of JPEG files. It
can translate the coded representation from one variant of
JPEG to another, for example from baseline JPEG to
progressive JPEG or vice versa. It can also perform some
rearrangements of the image data, for example turning an
image from landscape to portrait format by rotation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For EXIF files
and JPEG files containing Exif data, you may prefer to use
<b>exiftran</b> instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>jpegtran</b>
works by rearranging the compressed data (DCT coefficients),
without ever fully decoding the image. Therefore, its
transformations are lossless: there is no image degradation
at all, which would not be true if you used <b>djpeg</b>
followed by <b>cjpeg</b> to accomplish the same conversion.
But by the same token, <b>jpegtran</b> cannot perform lossy
operations such as changing the image quality. However,
while the image data is losslessly transformed, metadata can
be removed. See the <b>&minus;copy</b> option for
specifics.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>jpegtran</b>
reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or the standard input if no
file is named, and produces a JPEG/JFIF file on the standard
output.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All switch
names may be abbreviated; for example,
<b>&minus;optimize</b> may be written <b>&minus;opt</b> or
<b>&minus;o</b>. Upper and lower case are equivalent.
British spellings are also accepted (e.g.,
<b>&minus;optimise</b>), though for brevity these are not
mentioned below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To specify the
coded JPEG representation used in the output file,
<b>jpegtran</b> accepts a subset of the switches recognized
by <b>cjpeg</b>: <b><br>
&minus;optimize</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Perform optimization of entropy
encoding parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;progressive</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Create progressive JPEG
file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;restart</b>
<i>N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Emit a JPEG restart marker
every N MCU rows, or every N MCU blocks if &quot;B&quot; is
attached to the number.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;arithmetic</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use arithmetic coding.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;scans</b>
<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use the scan script given in
the specified text file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>cjpeg</b>(1) for more details about these switches. If
you specify none of these switches, you get a plain
baseline-JPEG output file. The quality setting and so forth
are determined by the input file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The image can
be losslessly transformed by giving one of these switches:
<b><br>
&minus;flip horizontal</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mirror image horizontally
(left-right).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;flip vertical</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Mirror image vertically
(top-bottom).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;rotate 90</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rotate image 90 degrees
clockwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;rotate 180</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rotate image 180 degrees.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;rotate 270</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rotate image 270 degrees
clockwise (or 90 ccw).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;transpose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Transpose image (across
UL-to-LR axis).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;transverse</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Transverse transpose (across
UR-to-LL axis).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The transpose
transformation has no restrictions regarding image
dimensions. The other transformations operate rather oddly
if the image dimensions are not a multiple of the iMCU size
(usually 8 or 16 pixels), because they can only transform
complete blocks of DCT coefficient data in the desired
way.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>jpegtran</b>&rsquo;s
default behavior when transforming an odd-size image is
designed to preserve exact reversibility and mathematical
consistency of the transformation set. As stated, transpose
is able to flip the entire image area. Horizontal mirroring
leaves any partial iMCU column at the right edge untouched,
but is able to flip all rows of the image. Similarly,
vertical mirroring leaves any partial iMCU row at the bottom
edge untouched, but is able to flip all columns. The other
transforms can be built up as sequences of transpose and
flip operations; for consistency, their actions on edge
pixels are defined to be the same as the end result of the
corresponding transpose-and-flip sequence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For practical
use, you may prefer to discard any untransformable edge
pixels rather than having a strange-looking strip along the
right and/or bottom edges of a transformed image. To do
this, add the <b>&minus;trim</b> switch:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>&minus;trim</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="53%">


<p>Drop non-transformable edge blocks.</p></td>
<td width="25%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Obviously, a
transformation with <b>&minus;trim</b> is not reversible, so
strictly speaking <b>jpegtran</b> with this switch is not
lossless. Also, the expected mathematical equivalences
between the transformations no longer hold. For example,
<b>&minus;rot 270 -trim</b> trims only the bottom edge, but
<b>&minus;rot 90 -trim</b> followed by <b>&minus;rot 180
-trim</b> trims both edges.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;perfect</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If you are only interested in
perfect transformations, add the <b>&minus;perfect</b>
switch. This causes <b>jpegtran</b> to fail with an error if
the transformation is not perfect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
you may want to do</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>(jpegtran
&minus;rot 90 -perfect</b> <i>foo.jpg</i> <b>|| djpeg</b>
<i>foo.jpg</i> <b>| pnmflip &minus;r90 | cjpeg)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">to do a perfect
rotation, if available, or an approximated one if not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This version of
<b>jpegtran</b> also offers a lossless crop option, which
discards data outside of a given image region but losslessly
preserves what is inside. Like the rotate and flip
transforms, lossless crop is restricted by the current JPEG
format; the upper left corner of the selected region must
fall on an iMCU boundary. If it doesn&rsquo;t, then it is
silently moved up and/or left to the nearest iMCU boundary
(the lower right corner is unchanged.) Thus, the output
image covers at least the requested region, but it may cover
more. The adjustment of the region dimensions may be
optionally disabled by attaching an</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The image can
be losslessly cropped by giving the switch: <b><br>
&minus;crop WxH+X+Y</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Crop the image to a rectangular
region of width W and height H, starting at point X,Y. The
lossless crop feature discards data outside of a given image
region but losslessly preserves what is inside. Like the
rotate and flip transforms, lossless crop is restricted by
the current JPEG format; the upper left corner of the
selected region must fall on an iMCU boundary. If it
doesn&rsquo;t, then it is silently moved up and/or left to
the nearest iMCU boundary (the lower right corner is
unchanged.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If W or H is
larger than the width/height of the input image, then the
output image is expanded in size, and the expanded region is
filled in with zeros (neutral gray). Attaching an
&rsquo;f&rsquo; character (&quot;flatten&quot;) to the width
number will cause each block in the expanded region to be
filled in with the DC coefficient of the nearest block in
the input image rather than grayed out. Attaching an
&rsquo;r&rsquo; character (&quot;reflect&quot;) to the width
number will cause the expanded region to be filled in with
repeated reflections of the input image rather than grayed
out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A complementary
lossless wipe option is provided to discard (gray out) data
inside a given image region while losslessly preserving what
is outside: <b><br>
&minus;wipe WxH+X+Y</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Wipe (gray out) a rectangular
region of width W and height H from the input image,
starting at point X,Y.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Attaching an
&rsquo;f&rsquo; character (&quot;flatten&quot;) to the width
number will cause the region to be filled with the average
of adjacent blocks rather than grayed out. If the wipe
region and the region outside the wipe region, when adjusted
to the nearest iMCU boundary, form two horizontally adjacent
rectangles, then attaching an &rsquo;r&rsquo; character
(&quot;reflect&quot;) to the width number will cause the
wipe region to be filled with repeated reflections of the
outside region rather than grayed out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A lossless drop
option is also provided, which allows another JPEG image to
be inserted (&quot;dropped&quot;) into the input image data
at a given position, replacing the existing image data at
that position: <b><br>
&minus;drop +X+Y filename</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Drop (insert) another image at
point X,Y</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both the input
image and the drop image must have the same subsampling
level. It is best if they also have the same quantization
(quality.) Otherwise, the quantization of the output image
will be adapted to accommodate the higher of the input image
quality and the drop image quality. The trim option can be
used with the drop option to requantize the drop image to
match the input image. Note that a grayscale image can be
dropped into a full-color image or vice versa, as long as
the full-color image has no vertical subsampling. If the
input image is grayscale and the drop image is full-color,
then the chrominance channels from the drop image will be
discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Other
not-strictly-lossless transformation switches are: <b><br>
&minus;grayscale</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Force grayscale output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
discards the chrominance channels if the input image is
YCbCr (ie, a standard color JPEG), resulting in a grayscale
JPEG file. The luminance channel is preserved exactly, so
this is a better method of reducing to grayscale than
decompression, conversion, and recompression. This switch is
particularly handy for fixing a monochrome picture that was
mistakenly encoded as a color JPEG. (In such a case, the
space savings from getting rid of the near-empty chroma
channels won&rsquo;t be large; but the decoding time for a
grayscale JPEG is substantially less than that for a color
JPEG.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>jpegtran</b>
also recognizes these switches that control what to do with
&quot;extra&quot; markers, such as comment blocks: <b><br>
&minus;copy none</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Copy no extra markers from
source file. This setting suppresses all comments and other
metadata in the source file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;copy comments</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Copy only comment markers. This
setting copies comments from the source file but discards
any other metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;copy icc</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Copy only ICC profile markers.
This setting copies the ICC profile from the source file but
discards any other metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;copy all</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Copy all extra markers. This
setting preserves miscellaneous markers found in the source
file, such as JFIF thumbnails, Exif data, and Photoshop
settings. In some files, these extra markers can be sizable.
Note that this option will copy thumbnails as-is; they will
not be transformed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behavior is <b>-copy comments</b>. (Note: in IJG releases v6
and v6a, <b>jpegtran</b> always did the equivalent of
<b>-copy none</b>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additional
switches recognized by jpegtran are: <b><br>
&minus;icc</b> <i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Embed ICC color management
profile contained in the specified file. Note that this will
cause <b>jpegtran</b> to ignore any APP2 markers in the
input file, even if <b>-copy all</b> or <b>-copy icc</b> is
specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;maxmemory</b>
<i>N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set limit for amount of memory
to use in processing large images. Value is in thousands of
bytes, or millions of bytes if &quot;M&quot; is attached to
the number. For example, <b>&minus;max 4m</b> selects
4000000 bytes. If more space is needed, an error will
occur.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;maxscans</b>
<i>N</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Abort if the input image
contains more than <i>N</i> scans. This feature demonstrates
a method by which applications can guard against
denial-of-service attacks instigated by specially-crafted
malformed JPEG images containing numerous scans with missing
image data or image data consisting only of &quot;EOB
runs&quot; (a feature of progressive JPEG images that allows
potentially hundreds of thousands of adjoining zero-value
pixels to be represented using only a few bytes.) Attempting
to transform such malformed JPEG images can cause excessive
CPU activity, since the decompressor must fully process each
scan (even if the scan is corrupt) before it can proceed to
the next scan.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;outfile</b>
<i>name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Send output image to the named
file, not to standard output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;report</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Report transformation
progress.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;strict</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Treat all warnings as fatal.
This feature also demonstrates a method by which
applications can guard against attacks instigated by
specially-crafted malformed JPEG images. Enabling this
option will cause the decompressor to abort if the input
image contains incomplete or corrupt image data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable debug printout. More
<b>&minus;v</b>&rsquo;s give more output. Also, version
information is printed at startup.</p>
