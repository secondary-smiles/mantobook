<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Updates files
in the working tree to match the version in the index or the
specified tree. If no pathspec was given, <i>git
checkout</i> will also update <b>HEAD</b> to set the
specified branch as the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
checkout</i> [&lt;branch&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">To prepare for working on
<b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>, switch to it by updating the index
and the files in the working tree, and by pointing
<b>HEAD</b> at the branch. Local modifications to the files
in the working tree are kept, so that they can be committed
to the <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> is not found but there does exist a
tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it
<b>&lt;remote&gt;</b>) with a matching name and
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;guess</b> is not specified, treat
as equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;b &lt;branch&gt; &minus;&minus;track
&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You could omit
<b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>, in which case the command degenerates
to &quot;check out the current branch&quot;, which is a
glorified no&minus;op with rather expensive
side&minus;effects to show only the tracking information, if
exists, for the current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
checkout</i> &minus;b|&minus;B &lt;new&minus;branch&gt;
[&lt;start&minus;point&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifying <b>&minus;b</b>
causes a new branch to be created as if <b>git-branch</b>(1)
were called and then checked out. In this case you can use
the <b>&minus;&minus;track</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;track</b> options, which will be
passed to <i>git branch</i>. As a convenience,
<b>&minus;&minus;track</b> without <b>&minus;b</b> implies
branch creation; see the description of
<b>&minus;&minus;track</b> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&minus;B</b> is given, <b>&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</b> is
created if it doesn&rsquo;t exist; otherwise, it is reset.
This is the transactional equivalent of</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git branch
&minus;f &lt;branch&gt; [&lt;start&minus;point&gt;] <br>
$ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">that is to say,
the branch is not reset/created unless &quot;git
checkout&quot; is successful.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
checkout</i> &minus;&minus;detach [&lt;branch&gt;], <i>git
checkout</i> [&minus;&minus;detach] &lt;commit&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Prepare to work on top of
<b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>, by detaching <b>HEAD</b> at it (see
&quot;DETACHED HEAD&quot; section), and updating the index
and the files in the working tree. Local modifications to
the files in the working tree are kept, so that the
resulting working tree will be the state recorded in the
commit plus the local modifications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> argument is a branch name, the
<b>&minus;&minus;detach</b> option can be used to detach
<b>HEAD</b> at the tip of the branch (<b>git checkout
&lt;branch&gt;</b> would check out that branch without
detaching <b>HEAD</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Omitting
<b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> detaches <b>HEAD</b> at the tip of the
current branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
checkout</i>
[&minus;f|&minus;&minus;ours|&minus;&minus;theirs|&minus;m|&minus;&minus;conflict=&lt;style&gt;]
[&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;] [&minus;&minus;]
&lt;pathspec&gt;..., <i>git checkout</i>
[&minus;f|&minus;&minus;ours|&minus;&minus;theirs|&minus;m|&minus;&minus;conflict=&lt;style&gt;]
[&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;]
&minus;&minus;pathspec&minus;from&minus;file=&lt;file&gt;
[&minus;&minus;pathspec&minus;file&minus;nul]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Overwrite the contents of the
files that match the pathspec. When the
<b>&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</b> (most often a commit) is not
given, overwrite working tree with the contents in the
index. When the <b>&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</b> is given,
overwrite both the index and the working tree with the
contents at the <b>&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The index may
contain unmerged entries because of a previous failed merge.
By default, if you try to check out such an entry from the
index, the checkout operation will fail and nothing will be
checked out. Using <b>&minus;f</b> will ignore these
unmerged entries. The contents from a specific side of the
merge can be checked out of the index by using
<b>&minus;&minus;ours</b> or <b>&minus;&minus;theirs</b>.
With <b>&minus;m</b>, changes made to the working tree file
can be discarded to re&minus;create the original conflicted
merge result.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
checkout</i> (&minus;p|&minus;&minus;patch)
[&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;] [&minus;&minus;]
[&lt;pathspec&gt;...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is similar to the previous
mode, but lets you use the interactive interface to show the
&quot;diff&quot; output and choose which hunks to use in the
result. See below for the description of
<b>&minus;&minus;patch</b> option.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;q,
&minus;&minus;quiet</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Quiet, suppress feedback
messages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;progress,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;progress</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Progress status is reported on
the standard error stream by default when it is attached to
a terminal, unless <b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b> is specified.
This flag enables progress reporting even if not attached to
a terminal, regardless of <b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;f,
&minus;&minus;force</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When switching branches,
proceed even if the index or the working tree differs from
<b>HEAD</b>, and even if there are untracked files in the
way. This is used to throw away local changes and any
untracked files or directories that are in the way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When checking
out paths from the index, do not fail upon unmerged entries;
instead, unmerged entries are ignored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ours,
&minus;&minus;theirs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When checking out paths from
the index, check out stage #2 (<i>ours</i>) or #3
(<i>theirs</i>) for unmerged paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
during <b>git rebase</b> and <b>git pull
&minus;&minus;rebase</b>, <i>ours</i> and <i>theirs</i> may
appear swapped; <b>&minus;&minus;ours</b> gives the version
from the branch the changes are rebased onto, while
<b>&minus;&minus;theirs</b> gives the version from the
branch that holds your work that is being rebased.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is because
<b>rebase</b> is used in a workflow that treats the history
at the remote as the shared canonical one, and treats the
work done on the branch you are rebasing as the
third&minus;party work to be integrated, and you are
temporarily assuming the role of the keeper of the canonical
history during the rebase. As the keeper of the canonical
history, you need to view the history from the remote as
<b>ours</b> (i.e. &quot;our shared canonical history&quot;),
while what you did on your side branch as <b>theirs</b>
(i.e. &quot;one contributor&rsquo;s work on top of
it&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;b
&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a new branch named
<b>&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</b>, start it at
<b>&lt;start&minus;point&gt;</b>, and check the resulting
branch out; see <b>git-branch</b>(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;B
&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Creates the branch
<b>&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</b>, start it at
<b>&lt;start&minus;point&gt;</b>; if it already exists, then
reset it to <b>&lt;start&minus;point&gt;</b>. And then check
the resulting branch out. This is equivalent to running
&quot;git branch&quot; with &quot;&minus;f&quot; followed by
&quot;git checkout&quot; of that branch; see
<b>git-branch</b>(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;t,
&minus;&minus;track[=(direct|inherit)]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When creating a new branch, set
up &quot;upstream&quot; configuration. See
&quot;&minus;&minus;track&quot; in <b>git-branch</b>(1) for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no
<b>&minus;b</b> option is given, the name of the new branch
will be derived from the remote&minus;tracking branch, by
looking at the local part of the refspec configured for the
corresponding remote, and then stripping the initial part up
to the &quot;*&quot;. This would tell us to use <b>hack</b>
as the local branch when branching off of <b>origin/hack</b>
(or <b>remotes/origin/hack</b>, or even
<b>refs/remotes/origin/hack</b>). If the given name has no
slash, or the above guessing results in an empty name, the
guessing is aborted. You can explicitly give a name with
<b>&minus;b</b> in such a case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;track</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not set up
&quot;upstream&quot; configuration, even if the
<b>branch.autoSetupMerge</b> configuration variable is
true.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;guess,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;guess</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> is not
found but there does exist a tracking branch in exactly one
remote (call it <b>&lt;remote&gt;</b>) with a matching name,
treat as equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;b &lt;branch&gt; &minus;&minus;track
&lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the branch
exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named by the
<b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> configuration variable,
we&rsquo;ll use that one for the purposes of disambiguation,
even if the <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> isn&rsquo;t unique across
all remotes. Set it to e.g.
<b>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</b> to always checkout
remote branches from there if <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> is
ambiguous but exists on the <i>origin</i> remote. See also
<b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;guess</b>
is the default behavior. Use
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;guess</b> to disable it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
behavior can be set via the <b>checkout.guess</b>
configuration variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;l</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create the new branch&rsquo;s
reflog; see <b>git-branch</b>(1) for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;d,
&minus;&minus;detach</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Rather than checking out a
branch to work on it, check out a commit for inspection and
discardable experiments. This is the default behavior of
<b>git checkout &lt;commit&gt;</b> when
<b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> is not a branch name. See the
&quot;DETACHED HEAD&quot; section below for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;orphan
&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Create a new <i>orphan</i>
branch, named <b>&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</b>, started from
<b>&lt;start&minus;point&gt;</b> and switch to it. The first
commit made on this new branch will have no parents and it
will be the root of a new history totally disconnected from
all the other branches and commits.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The index and
the working tree are adjusted as if you had previously run
<b>git checkout &lt;start&minus;point&gt;</b>. This allows
you to start a new history that records a set of paths
similar to <b>&lt;start&minus;point&gt;</b> by easily
running <b>git commit &minus;a</b> to make the root
commit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This can be
useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit
without exposing its full history. You might want to do this
to publish an open source branch of a project whose current
tree is &quot;clean&quot;, but whose full history contains
proprietary or otherwise encumbered bits of code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
start a disconnected history that records a set of paths
that is totally different from the one of
<b>&lt;start&minus;point&gt;</b>, then you should clear the
index and the working tree right after creating the orphan
branch by running <b>git rm &minus;rf .</b> from the top
level of the working tree. Afterwards you will be ready to
prepare your new files, repopulating the working tree, by
copying them from elsewhere, extracting a tarball, etc.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;skip&minus;worktree&minus;bits</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In sparse checkout mode, <b>git
checkout &minus;&minus; &lt;paths&gt;</b> would update only
entries matched by <b>&lt;paths&gt;</b> and sparse patterns
in <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse&minus;checkout</b>. This option
ignores the sparse patterns and adds back any files in
<b>&lt;paths&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;m,
&minus;&minus;merge</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When switching branches, if you
have local modifications to one or more files that are
different between the current branch and the branch to which
you are switching, the command refuses to switch branches in
order to preserve your modifications in context. However,
with this option, a three&minus;way merge between the
current branch, your working tree contents, and the new
branch is done, and you will be on the new branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When a merge
conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting paths
are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the conflicts and
mark the resolved paths with <b>git add</b> (or <b>git
rm</b> if the merge should result in deletion of the
path).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When checking
out paths from the index, this option lets you recreate the
conflicted merge in the specified paths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When switching
branches with <b>&minus;&minus;merge</b>, staged changes may
be lost.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;conflict=&lt;style&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The same as
<b>&minus;&minus;merge</b> option above, but changes the way
the conflicting hunks are presented, overriding the
<b>merge.conflictStyle</b> configuration variable. Possible
values are &quot;merge&quot; (default), &quot;diff3&quot;,
and &quot;zdiff3&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;p,
&minus;&minus;patch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Interactively select hunks in
the difference between the <b>&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</b> (or
the index, if unspecified) and the working tree. The chosen
hunks are then applied in reverse to the working tree (and
if a <b>&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</b> was specified, the
index).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
you can use <b>git checkout &minus;p</b> to selectively
discard edits from your current working tree. See the
&ldquo;Interactive Mode&rdquo; section of <b>git-add</b>(1)
to learn how to operate the <b>&minus;&minus;patch</b>
mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
option uses the no overlay mode by default (see also
<b>&minus;&minus;overlay</b>), and currently doesn&rsquo;t
support overlay mode.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;other&minus;worktrees</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><b>git checkout</b> refuses
when the wanted ref is already checked out by another
worktree. This option makes it check the ref out anyway. In
other words, the ref can be held by more than one
worktree.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;overwrite&minus;ignore,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;overwrite&minus;ignore</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Silently overwrite ignored
files when switching branches. This is the default behavior.
Use <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;overwrite&minus;ignore</b> to
abort the operation when the new branch contains ignored
files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;recurse&minus;submodules,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;recurse&minus;submodules</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Using
<b>&minus;&minus;recurse&minus;submodules</b> will update
the content of all active submodules according to the commit
recorded in the superproject. If local modifications in a
submodule would be overwritten the checkout will fail unless
<b>&minus;f</b> is used. If nothing (or
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;recurse&minus;submodules</b>) is
used, submodules working trees will not be updated. Just
like <b>git-submodule</b>(1), this will detach <b>HEAD</b>
of the submodule.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;overlay,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;overlay</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In the default overlay mode,
<b>git checkout</b> never removes files from the index or
the working tree. When specifying
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;overlay</b>, files that appear in
the index and working tree, but not in
<b>&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</b> are removed, to make them
match <b>&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</b> exactly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;pathspec&minus;from&minus;file=&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pathspec is passed in
<b>&lt;file&gt;</b> instead of commandline args. If
<b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is exactly <b>&minus;</b> then standard
input is used. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or
CR/LF. Pathspec elements can be quoted as explained for the
configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b> (see
<b>git-config</b>(1)). See also
<b>&minus;&minus;pathspec&minus;file&minus;nul</b> and
global <b>&minus;&minus;literal&minus;pathspecs</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;pathspec&minus;file&minus;nul</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only meaningful with
<b>&minus;&minus;pathspec&minus;from&minus;file</b>.
Pathspec elements are separated with NUL character and all
other characters are taken literally (including newlines and
quotes).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Branch to checkout; if it
refers to a branch (i.e., a name that, when prepended with
&quot;refs/heads/&quot;, is a valid ref), then that branch
is checked out. Otherwise, if it refers to a valid commit,
your <b>HEAD</b> becomes &quot;detached&quot; and you are no
longer on any branch (see below for details).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can use the
<b>@{&minus;N}</b> syntax to refer to the N&minus;th last
branch/commit checked out using &quot;git checkout&quot;
operation. You may also specify <b>&minus;</b> which is
synonymous to <b>@{&minus;1}</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case, you may use <b>A...B</b> as a shortcut for the merge
base of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> if there is exactly one merge
base. You can leave out at most one of <b>A</b> and
<b>B</b>, in which case it defaults to <b>HEAD</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;new&minus;branch&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Name for the new branch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;start&minus;point&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of a commit at which
to start the new branch; see <b>git-branch</b>(1) for
details. Defaults to <b>HEAD</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case, you may use <b>&quot;A...B&quot;</b> as a shortcut for
the merge base of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> if there is exactly
one merge base. You can leave out at most one of <b>A</b>
and <b>B</b>, in which case it defaults to <b>HEAD</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Tree to checkout from (when
paths are given). If not specified, the index will be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case, you may use <b>&quot;A...B&quot;</b> as a shortcut for
the merge base of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> if there is exactly
one merge base. You can leave out at most one of <b>A</b>
and <b>B</b>, in which case it defaults to <b>HEAD</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not interpret any more
arguments as options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;pathspec&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limits the paths affected by
the operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For more
details, see the <i>pathspec</i> entry in
<b>gitglossary</b>(7).</p>

<h2>DETACHED HEAD
<a name="DETACHED HEAD"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>HEAD</b>
normally refers to a named branch (e.g. <b>master</b>).
Meanwhile, each branch refers to a specific commit.
Let&rsquo;s look at a repo with three commits, one of them
tagged, and with branch <b>master</b> checked out:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
branch 'master') <br>
| <br>
v <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a commit
is created in this state, the branch is updated to refer to
the new commit. Specifically, <i>git commit</i> creates a
new commit <b>d</b>, whose parent is commit <b>c</b>, and
then updates branch <b>master</b> to refer to new commit
<b>d</b>. <b>HEAD</b> still refers to branch <b>master</b>
and so indirectly now refers to commit <b>d</b>:</p>

tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is sometimes
useful to be able to checkout a commit that is not at the
tip of any named branch, or even to create a new commit that
is not referenced by a named branch. Let&rsquo;s look at
what happens when we checkout commit <b>b</b> (here we show
two ways this may be done):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
v2.0 # or <br>
$ git checkout master^^</p>

^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Notice that
regardless of which checkout command we use, <b>HEAD</b> now
refers directly to commit <b>b</b>. This is known as being
in detached <b>HEAD</b> state. It means simply that
<b>HEAD</b> refers to a specific commit, as opposed to
referring to a named branch. Let&rsquo;s see what happens
when we create a commit:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ edit; git
add; git commit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
commit 'e') <br>

^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is now a
new commit <b>e</b>, but it is referenced only by
<b>HEAD</b>. We can of course add yet another commit in this
state:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ edit; git
add; git commit</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
commit 'f') <br>

branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd') <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In fact, we can
perform all the normal Git operations. But, let&rsquo;s look
at what happens when we then checkout <b>master</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
master</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">HEAD (refers to
branch 'master') <br>
e&minus;&minus;&minus;f | <br>

branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd') <br>
^ <br>
| <br>
tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
to realize that at this point nothing refers to commit
<b>f</b>. Eventually commit <b>f</b> (and by extension
commit <b>e</b>) will be deleted by the routine Git garbage
collection process, unless we create a reference before that
happens. If we have not yet moved away from commit <b>f</b>,
any of these will create a reference to it:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;b foo # or &quot;git switch &minus;c foo&quot;
<b>(1)</b> <br>
$ git branch foo <b>(2)</b> <br>
$ git tag foo <b>(3)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b>
creates a new branch <b>foo</b>, which refers to commit
<b>f</b>, and then updates <b>HEAD</b> to refer to branch
<b>foo</b>. In other words, we&rsquo;ll no longer be in
detached <b>HEAD</b> state after this command. <b><br>
2.</b> similarly creates a new branch <b>foo</b>, which
refers to commit <b>f</b>, but leaves <b>HEAD</b> detached.
<b><br>
3.</b> creates a new tag <b>foo</b>, which refers to commit
<b>f</b>, leaving <b>HEAD</b> detached.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If we have
moved away from commit <b>f</b>, then we must first recover
its object name (typically by using git reflog), and then we
can create a reference to it. For example, to see the last
two commits to which <b>HEAD</b> referred, we can use either
of these commands:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git reflog
&minus;2 HEAD # or <br>
$ git log &minus;g &minus;2 HEAD</p>

<h2>ARGUMENT DISAMBIGUATION
<a name="ARGUMENT DISAMBIGUATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When there is
only one argument given and it is not <b>&minus;&minus;</b>
(e.g. <b>git checkout abc</b>), and when the argument is
both a valid <b>&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</b> (e.g. a branch
<b>abc</b> exists) and a valid <b>&lt;pathspec&gt;</b> (e.g.
a file or a directory whose name is &quot;abc&quot; exists),
Git would usually ask you to disambiguate. Because checking
out a branch is so common an operation, however, <b>git
checkout abc</b> takes &quot;abc&quot; as a
<b>&lt;tree&minus;ish&gt;</b> in such a situation. Use
<b>git checkout &minus;&minus; &lt;pathspec&gt;</b> if you
want to checkout these paths out of the index.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. The
following sequence checks out the <b>master</b> branch,
reverts the <b>Makefile</b> to two revisions back, deletes
<b>hello.c</b> by mistake, and gets it back from the
index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
master <b>(1)</b> <br>
$ git checkout master~2 Makefile <b>(2)</b> <br>
$ rm &minus;f hello.c <br>
$ git checkout hello.c <b>(3)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>1.</b>
switch branch <b><br>
2.</b> take a file out of another commit <b><br>
3.</b> restore <b>hello.c</b> from the index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
check out <i>all</i> C source files out of the index, you
can say</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;&minus; '*.c'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the quotes
around <b>*.c</b>. The file <b>hello.c</b> will also be
checked out, even though it is no longer in the working
tree, because the file globbing is used to match entries in
the index (not in the working tree by the shell).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you have an
unfortunate branch that is named <b>hello.c</b>, this step
would be confused as an instruction to switch to that
branch. You should instead write:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;&minus; hello.c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. After
working in the wrong branch, switching to the correct branch
would be done using:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
mytopic</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, your
&quot;wrong&quot; branch and correct <b>mytopic</b> branch
may differ in files that you have modified locally, in which
case the above checkout would fail like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
mytopic <br>
error: You have local changes to 'frotz'; not switching
branches.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can give
the <b>&minus;m</b> flag to the command, which would try a
three&minus;way merge:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;m mytopic <br>
Auto&minus;merging frotz</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">After this
three&minus;way merge, the local modifications are
<i>not</i> registered in your index file, so <b>git diff</b>
would show you what changes you made since the tip of the
new branch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. When a merge
conflict happens during switching branches with the
<b>&minus;m</b> option, you would see something like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ git checkout
&minus;m mytopic <br>
Auto&minus;merging frotz <br>
ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz <br>
fatal: merge program failed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">At this point,
<b>git diff</b> shows the changes cleanly merged as in the
previous example, as well as the changes in the conflicted
files. Edit and resolve the conflict and mark it resolved
with <b>git add</b> as usual:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">$ edit frotz
<br>
$ git add frotz</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Everything
below this line in this section is selectively included from
the <b>git-config</b>(1) documentation. The content is the
same as what&rsquo;s found there:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">checkout.defaultRemote</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When you run <b>git checkout
&lt;something&gt;</b> or <b>git switch &lt;something&gt;</b>
and only have one remote, it may implicitly fall back on
checking out and tracking e.g.
<b>origin/&lt;something&gt;</b>. This stops working as soon
as you have more than one remote with a
<b>&lt;something&gt;</b> reference. This setting allows for
setting the name of a preferred remote that should always
win when it comes to disambiguation. The typical
use&minus;case is to set this to <b>origin</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Currently this
is used by <b>git-switch</b>(1) and <b>git-checkout</b>(1)
when <b>git checkout &lt;something&gt;</b> or <b>git switch
&lt;something&gt;</b> will checkout the
<b>&lt;something&gt;</b> branch on another remote, and by
<b>git-worktree</b>(1) when <b>git worktree add</b> refers
to a remote branch. This setting might be used for other
checkout&minus;like commands or functionality in the
future.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">checkout.guess</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Provides the default value for
the <b>&minus;&minus;guess</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;guess</b> option in <b>git
checkout</b> and <b>git switch</b>. See <b>git-switch</b>(1)
and <b>git-checkout</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">checkout.workers</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The number of parallel workers
to use when updating the working tree. The default is one,
i.e. sequential execution. If set to a value less than one,
Git will use as many workers as the number of logical cores
available. This setting and
<b>checkout.thresholdForParallelism</b> affect all commands
that perform checkout. E.g. checkout, clone, reset,
sparse&minus;checkout, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note: parallel
checkout usually delivers better performance for
repositories located on SSDs or over NFS. For repositories
on spinning disks and/or machines with a small number of
cores, the default sequential checkout often performs
better. The size and compression level of a repository might
also influence how well the parallel version performs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">checkout.thresholdForParallelism</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When running parallel checkout
with a small number of files, the cost of subprocess
spawning and inter&minus;process communication might
outweigh the parallelization gains. This setting allows to
define the minimum number of files for which parallel
checkout should be attempted. The default is 100.</p>
