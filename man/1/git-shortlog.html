</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
shortlog</i> [&lt;options&gt;]

&lt;path&gt;...] <br>
git log &minus;&minus;pretty=short | <i>git shortlog</i>
[&lt;options&gt;]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Summarizes
<i>git log</i> output in a format suitable for inclusion in
release announcements. Each commit will be grouped by author
and title.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
&quot;[PATCH]&quot; will be stripped from the commit
description.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no revisions
are passed on the command line and either standard input is
not a terminal or there is no current branch, <i>git
shortlog</i> will output a summary of the log read from
standard input, without reference to the current
repository.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;n,
&minus;&minus;numbered</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sort output according to the
number of commits per author instead of author alphabetic
order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;s,
&minus;&minus;summary</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Suppress commit description and
provide a commit count summary only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;e,
&minus;&minus;email</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show the email address of each
author.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;format[=&lt;format&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of the commit subject,
use some other information to describe each commit.
<i>&lt;format&gt;</i> can be any string accepted by the
<b>&minus;&minus;format</b> option of <i>git log</i>, such
as <i>* [%h] %s</i>. (See the &quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot;
section of <b>git-log</b>(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Each
pretty&minus;printed commit will be rewrapped before it is
shown.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;date=&lt;format&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show dates formatted according
to the given date string. (See the <b>&minus;&minus;date</b>
option in the &quot;Commit Formatting&quot; section of
<b>git-log</b>(1)). Useful with
<b>&minus;&minus;group=format:&lt;format&gt;</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;group=&lt;type&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Group commits based on
<b>&lt;type&gt;</b>. If no <b>&minus;&minus;group</b> option
is specified, the default is <b>author</b>.
<b>&lt;type&gt;</b> is one of:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>author</b>, commits are grouped by author</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>committer</b>, commits are grouped by committer (the same
as <b>&minus;c</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>trailer:&lt;field&gt;</b>, the <b>&lt;field&gt;</b> is
interpreted as a case&minus;insensitive commit message
trailer (see <b>git-interpret-trailers</b>(1)). For example,
if your project uses <b>Reviewed&minus;by</b> trailers, you
might want to see who has been reviewing with <b>git
shortlog &minus;ns
&minus;&minus;group=trailer:reviewed&minus;by</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>format:&lt;format&gt;</b>, any string accepted by the
<b>&minus;&minus;format</b> option of <i>git log</i>. (See
the &quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot; section of
<b>git-log</b>(1).)</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
commits that do not include the trailer will not be counted.
Likewise, commits with multiple trailers (e.g., multiple
signoffs) may be counted more than once (but only once per
unique trailer value in that commit).</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Shortlog will
attempt to parse each trailer value as a <b>name
&lt;email&gt;</b> identity. If successful, the mailmap is
applied and the email is omitted unless the
<b>&minus;&minus;email</b> option is specified. If the value
cannot be parsed as an identity, it will be taken literally
and completely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>&minus;&minus;group</b> is specified multiple times,
commits are counted under each value (but again, only once
per unique value in that commit). For example, <b>git
shortlog &minus;&minus;group=author
&minus;&minus;group=trailer:co&minus;authored&minus;by</b>
counts both authors and co&minus;authors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;c,
&minus;&minus;committer</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is an alias for
<b>&minus;&minus;group=committer</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;w[&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;indent1&gt;[,&lt;indent2&gt;]]]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Linewrap the output by wrapping
each line at <b>width</b>. The first line of each entry is
indented by <b>indent1</b> spaces, and the second and
subsequent lines are indented by <b>indent2</b> spaces.
<b>width</b>, <b>indent1</b>, and <b>indent2</b> default to
76, 6 and 9 respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If width is
<b>0</b> (zero) then indent the lines of the output without
wrapping them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;revision&minus;range&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show only commits in the
specified revision range. When no
&lt;revision&minus;range&gt; is specified, it defaults to
<b>HEAD</b> (i.e. the whole history leading to the current
commit). <b>origin..HEAD</b> specifies all the commits
reachable from the current commit (i.e. <b>HEAD</b>), but
not from <b>origin</b>. For a complete list of ways to spell
&lt;revision&minus;range&gt;, see the &quot;Specifying
Ranges&quot; section of <b>gitrevisions</b>(7).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">[&minus;&minus;]
&lt;path&gt;...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider only commits that are
enough to explain how the files that match the specified
paths came to be.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Paths may need
to be prefixed with <b>&minus;&minus;</b> to separate them
from options or the revision range, when confusion
arises.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Commit
Limiting</b> <br>
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed
using the special notations explained in the description,
additional commit limiting may be applied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using more
options generally further limits the output (e.g.
<b>&minus;&minus;since=&lt;date1&gt;</b> limits to commits
newer than <b>&lt;date1&gt;</b>, and using it with
<b>&minus;&minus;grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b> further limits to
commits whose log message has a line that matches
<b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>), unless otherwise noted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that these
are applied before commit ordering and formatting options,
such as <b>&minus;&minus;reverse</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&lt;number&gt;,
&minus;n &lt;number&gt;,
&minus;&minus;max&minus;count=&lt;number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the number of commits to
output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;skip=&lt;number&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Skip <i>number</i> commits
before starting to show the commit output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;since=&lt;date&gt;,
&minus;&minus;after=&lt;date&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show commits more recent than a
specific date.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;since&minus;as&minus;filter=&lt;date&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show all commits more recent
than a specific date. This visits all commits in the range,
rather than stopping at the first commit which is older than
a specific date.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;until=&lt;date&gt;,
&minus;&minus;before=&lt;date&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show commits older than a
specific date.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;author=&lt;pattern&gt;,
&minus;&minus;committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones with author/committer header lines that match the
specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
<b>&minus;&minus;author=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose
author matches any of the given patterns are chosen
(similarly for multiple
<b>&minus;&minus;committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;grep&minus;reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones with reflog entries that match the specified pattern
(regular expression). With more than one
<b>&minus;&minus;grep&minus;reflog</b>, commits whose reflog
message matches any of the given patterns are chosen. It is
an error to use this option unless
<b>&minus;&minus;walk&minus;reflogs</b> is in use.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones with log message that matches the specified pattern
(regular expression). With more than one
<b>&minus;&minus;grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose
message matches any of the given patterns are chosen (but
see <b>&minus;&minus;all&minus;match</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>&minus;&minus;notes</b> is in effect, the message from
the notes is matched as if it were part of the log
message.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;all&minus;match</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones that match all given <b>&minus;&minus;grep</b>, instead
of ones that match at least one.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;invert&minus;grep</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the commits output to
ones with log message that do not match the pattern
specified with
<b>&minus;&minus;grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;i,
&minus;&minus;regexp&minus;ignore&minus;case</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Match the regular expression
limiting patterns without regard to letter case.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;basic&minus;regexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider the limiting patterns
to be basic regular expressions; this is the default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;E,
&minus;&minus;extended&minus;regexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider the limiting patterns
to be extended regular expressions instead of the default
basic regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;F,
&minus;&minus;fixed&minus;strings</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider the limiting patterns
to be fixed strings (don&rsquo;t interpret pattern as a
regular expression).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;P,
&minus;&minus;perl&minus;regexp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Consider the limiting patterns
to be Perl&minus;compatible regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
these types of regular expressions is an optional
compile&minus;time dependency. If Git wasn&rsquo;t compiled
with support for them providing this option will cause it to
die.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;remove&minus;empty</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Stop when a given path
disappears from the tree.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;merges</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Print only merge commits. This
is exactly the same as
<b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;parents=2</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;no&minus;merges</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not print commits with more
than one parent. This is exactly the same as
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;parents=1</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;min&minus;parents=&lt;number&gt;,
&minus;&minus;max&minus;parents=&lt;number&gt;,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;min&minus;parents,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;max&minus;parents</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Show only commits which have at
least (or at most) that many parent commits. In particular,
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;parents=1</b> is the same as
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;merges</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;parents=2</b> is the same as
<b>&minus;&minus;merges</b>.
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;parents=0</b> gives all root
commits and <b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;parents=3</b> all
octopus merges.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;min&minus;parents</b>
and <b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;max&minus;parents</b> reset
these limits (to no limit) again. Equivalent forms are
<b>&minus;&minus;min&minus;parents=0</b> (any commit has 0
or more parents) and
<b>&minus;&minus;max&minus;parents=&minus;1</b> (negative
numbers denote no upper limit).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;first&minus;parent</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When finding commits to
include, follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a
merge commit. This option can give a better overview when
viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because
merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting
to updated upstream from time to time, and this option
allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to
your history by such a merge.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;first&minus;parent&minus;only</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When finding commits to exclude
(with a <i>^</i>), follow only the first parent commit upon
seeing a merge commit. This can be used to find the set of
changes in a topic branch from the point where it diverged
from the remote branch, given that arbitrary merges can be
valid topic branch changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;not</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reverses the meaning of the
<i>^</i> prefix (or lack thereof) for all following revision
specifiers, up to the next <b>&minus;&minus;not</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;all</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs in
<b>refs/</b>, along with <b>HEAD</b>, are listed on the
command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs in
<b>refs/heads</b> are listed on the command line as
<i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given,
limit branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern
lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end
is implied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs in
<b>refs/tags</b> are listed on the command line as
<i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given,
limit tags to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern
lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end
is implied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs in
<b>refs/remotes</b> are listed on the command line as
<i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given,
limit remote&minus;tracking branches to ones matching given
shell glob. If pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or
<i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;glob=&lt;glob&minus;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all the refs
matching shell glob <i>&lt;glob&minus;pattern&gt;</i> are
listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. Leading
<i>refs/</i>, is automatically prepended if missing. If
pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at
the end is implied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;exclude=&lt;glob&minus;pattern&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not include refs matching
<i>&lt;glob&minus;pattern&gt;</i> that the next
<b>&minus;&minus;all</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;branches</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;tags</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;remotes</b>, or
<b>&minus;&minus;glob</b> would otherwise consider.
Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns up
to the next <b>&minus;&minus;all</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;branches</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;tags</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;remotes</b>, or <b>&minus;&minus;glob</b>
option (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated
patterns).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The patterns
given should not begin with <b>refs/heads</b>,
<b>refs/tags</b>, or <b>refs/remotes</b> when applied to
<b>&minus;&minus;branches</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;tags</b>, or
<b>&minus;&minus;remotes</b>, respectively, and they must
begin with <b>refs/</b> when applied to
<b>&minus;&minus;glob</b> or <b>&minus;&minus;all</b>. If a
trailing <i>/*</i> is intended, it must be given
explicitly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;exclude&minus;hidden=[receive|uploadpack]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not include refs that would
be hidden by <b>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</b> or
<b>git&minus;upload&minus;pack</b> by consulting the
appropriate <b>receive.hideRefs</b> or
<b>uploadpack.hideRefs</b> configuration along with
<b>transfer.hideRefs</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). This
option affects the next pseudo&minus;ref option
<b>&minus;&minus;all</b> or <b>&minus;&minus;glob</b> and is
cleared after processing them.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;reflog</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all objects
mentioned by reflogs are listed on the command line as
<b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;alternate&minus;refs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if all objects
mentioned as ref tips of alternate repositories were listed
on the command line. An alternate repository is any
repository whose object directory is specified in
<b>objects/info/alternates</b>. The set of included objects
may be modified by <b>core.alternateRefsCommand</b>, etc.
See <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;single&minus;worktree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, all working trees
will be examined by the following options when there are
more than one (see <b>git-worktree</b>(1)):
<b>&minus;&minus;all</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;reflog</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;indexed&minus;objects</b>. This option
forces them to examine the current working tree only.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;missing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Upon seeing an invalid object
name in the input, pretend as if the bad input was not
given.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;bisect</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Pretend as if the bad bisection
ref <b>refs/bisect/bad</b> was listed and as if it was
followed by <b>&minus;&minus;not</b> and the good bisection
refs <b>refs/bisect/good&minus;*</b> on the command
line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;stdin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to the
<i>&lt;commit&gt;</i> listed on the command line, read them
from the standard input. If a <b>&minus;&minus;</b>
separator is seen, stop reading commits and start reading
paths to limit the result.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;cherry&minus;mark</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like
<b>&minus;&minus;cherry&minus;pick</b> (see below) but mark
equivalent commits with <b>=</b> rather than omitting them,
and inequivalent ones with <b>+</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;cherry&minus;pick</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Omit any commit that introduces
the same change as another commit on the &ldquo;other
side&rdquo; when the set of commits are limited with
symmetric difference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you have two branches, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, a usual way to
list all commits on only one side of them is with
<b>&minus;&minus;left&minus;right</b> (see the example below
in the description of the
<b>&minus;&minus;left&minus;right</b> option). However, it
shows the commits that were cherry&minus;picked from the
other branch (for example, &ldquo;3rd on b&rdquo; may be
cherry&minus;picked from branch A). With this option, such
pairs of commits are excluded from the output.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;left&minus;only,
&minus;&minus;right&minus;only</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">List only commits on the
respective side of a symmetric difference, i.e. only those
which would be marked <b>&lt;</b> resp. <b>&gt;</b> by
<b>&minus;&minus;left&minus;right</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
<b>&minus;&minus;cherry&minus;pick
&minus;&minus;right&minus;only A...B</b> omits those commits
from <b>B</b> which are in <b>A</b> or are
patch&minus;equivalent to a commit in <b>A</b>. In other
words, this lists the <b>+</b> commits from <b>git cherry A
B</b>. More precisely, <b>&minus;&minus;cherry&minus;pick
&minus;&minus;right&minus;only
&minus;&minus;no&minus;merges</b> gives the exact list.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;cherry</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A synonym for
<b>&minus;&minus;right&minus;only
&minus;&minus;cherry&minus;mark
&minus;&minus;no&minus;merges</b>; useful to limit the
output to the commits on our side and mark those that have
been applied to the other side of a forked history with
<b>git log &minus;&minus;cherry upstream...mybranch</b>,
similar to <b>git cherry upstream mybranch</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;g,
&minus;&minus;walk&minus;reflogs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of walking the commit
ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one
to older ones. When this option is used you cannot specify
commits to exclude (that is, <i>^commit</i>,
<i>commit1..commit2</i>, and <i>commit1...commit2</i>
notations cannot be used).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With
<b>&minus;&minus;pretty</b> format other than <b>oneline</b>
and <b>reference</b> (for obvious reasons), this causes the
output to have two extra lines of information taken from the
reflog. The reflog designator in the output may be shown as
<b>ref@{Nth}</b> (where <b>Nth</b> is the
reverse&minus;chronological index in the reflog) or as
<b>ref@{timestamp}</b> (with the timestamp for that entry),
depending on a few rules:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">1. If the

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>History
Simplification</b> <br>
Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history,
for example the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;.
But there are two parts of <i>History Simplification</i>,
one part is selecting the commits and the other is how to do
it, as there are various strategies to simplify the
history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options select the commits to be shown:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;paths&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits modifying the given
&lt;paths&gt; are selected.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;simplify&minus;by&minus;decoration</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits that are referred by
some branch or tag are selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that extra
commits can be shown to give a meaningful history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options affect the way the simplification is performed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Default
mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Simplifies the history to the
simplest history explaining the final state of the tree.
Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the end
result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the same
content)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;show&minus;pulls</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Include all commits from the
default mode, but also any merge commits that are not
TREESAME to the first parent but are TREESAME to a later
parent. This mode is helpful for showing the merge commits
that &quot;first introduced&quot; a change to a branch.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as the default mode, but
does not prune some history.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;dense</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only the selected commits are
shown, plus some to have a meaningful history.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;sparse</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All commits in the simplified
history are shown.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;simplify&minus;merges</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Additional option to
<b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b> to remove some
needless merges from the resulting history, as there are no
selected commits contributing to this merge.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ancestry&minus;path[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When given a range of commits
to display (e.g. <i>commit1..commit2</i> or <i>commit2
^commit1</i>), only display commits in that range that are
ancestors of &lt;commit&gt;, descendants of &lt;commit&gt;,
or &lt;commit&gt; itself. If no commit is specified, use
<i>commit1</i> (the excluded part of the range) as
&lt;commit&gt;. Can be passed multiple times; if so, a
commit is included if it is any of the commits given or if
it is an ancestor or descendant of one of them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A more detailed
explanation follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Suppose you
specified <b>foo</b> as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall call
commits that modify <b>foo</b> !TREESAME, and the rest
TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for <b>foo</b>, they look
different and equal, respectively.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
following, we will always refer to the same example history
to illustrate the differences between simplification
settings. We assume that you are filtering for a file
<b>foo</b> in this commit graph:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">.&minus;A&minus;&minus;&minus;M&minus;&minus;&minus;N&minus;&minus;&minus;O&minus;&minus;&minus;P&minus;&minus;&minus;Q
<br>
/ / / / / / <br>
I B C D E Y <br>
\ / / / / / <br>

&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;'
X</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The horizontal
line of history A&minus;&minus;&minus;Q is taken to be the
first parent of each merge. The commits are:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>I</b>
is the initial commit, in which <b>foo</b> exists with
contents &ldquo;asdf&rdquo;, and a file <b>quux</b> exists
with contents &ldquo;quux&rdquo;. Initial commits are
compared to an empty tree, so <b>I</b> is !TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; In
<b>A</b>, <b>foo</b> contains just &ldquo;foo&rdquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>B</b>
contains the same change as <b>A</b>. Its merge <b>M</b> is
trivial and hence TREESAME to all parents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>C</b>
does not change <b>foo</b>, but its merge <b>N</b> changes
it to &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;, so it is not TREESAME to any
parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>D</b>
sets <b>foo</b> to &ldquo;baz&rdquo;. Its merge <b>O</b>
combines the strings from <b>N</b> and <b>D</b> to
&ldquo;foobarbaz&rdquo;; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any
parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>E</b>
changes <b>quux</b> to &ldquo;xyzzy&rdquo;, and its merge
<b>P</b> combines the strings to &ldquo;quux xyzzy&rdquo;.
<b>P</b> is TREESAME to <b>O</b>, but not to <b>E</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; <b>X</b>
is an independent root commit that added a new file
<b>side</b>, and <b>Y</b> modified it. <b>Y</b> is TREESAME
to <b>X</b>. Its merge <b>Q</b> added <b>side</b> to
<b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b> is TREESAME to <b>P</b>, but not to
<b>Y</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rev&minus;list</b>
walks backwards through history, including or excluding
commits based on whether
<b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b> and/or parent
rewriting (via <b>&minus;&minus;parents</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;children</b>) are used. The following
settings are available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Default
mode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits are included if they
are not TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed,
see <b>&minus;&minus;sparse</b> below). If the commit was a
merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that
parent. (Even if there are several TREESAME parents, follow
only one of them.) Otherwise, follow all parents.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This results
in:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">.&minus;A&minus;&minus;&minus;N&minus;&minus;&minus;O
<br>
/ / / <br>

I&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;D</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note how the
rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
available, removed <b>B</b> from consideration entirely.
<b>C</b> was considered via <b>N</b>, but is TREESAME. Root
commits are compared to an empty tree, so <b>I</b> is
!TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Parent/child
relations are only visible with
<b>&minus;&minus;parents</b>, but that does not affect the
commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the
parent lines.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;full&minus;history
without parent rewriting</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This mode differs from the
default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge,
even if it is TREESAME to one of them. Even if more than one
side of the merge has commits that are included, this does
not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we
get</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">I A B N D O P
Q</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>M</b> was
excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents. <b>E</b>,
<b>C</b> and <b>B</b> were all walked, but only <b>B</b> was
!TREESAME, so the others do not appear.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk
about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so
we show them disconnected.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;full&minus;history
with parent rewriting</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ordinary commits are only
included if they are !TREESAME (though this can be changed,
see <b>&minus;&minus;sparse</b> below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Merges are
always included. However, their parent list is rewritten:
Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included
themselves. This results in</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">.&minus;A&minus;&minus;&minus;M&minus;&minus;&minus;N&minus;&minus;&minus;O&minus;&minus;&minus;P&minus;&minus;&minus;Q
<br>
/ / / / / <br>
I B / D / <br>
\ / / / / <br>

&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Compare to
<b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b> without rewriting
above. Note that <b>E</b> was pruned away because it is
TREESAME, but the parent list of P was rewritten to contain
<b>E</b>'s parent <b>I</b>. The same happened for <b>C</b>
and <b>N</b>, and <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Q</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME affects
inclusion:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;dense</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Commits that are walked are
included if they are not TREESAME to any parent.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;sparse</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All commits that are walked are
included.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
without <b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b>, this still
simplifies merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we
follow only that one, so the other sides of the merge are
never walked.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;simplify&minus;merges</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">First, build a history graph in
the same way that <b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b>
with parent rewriting does (see above).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Then simplify
each commit <b>C</b> to its replacement <b>C'</b> in the
final history according to the following rules:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Set
<b>C'</b> to <b>C</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Replace
each parent <b>P</b> of <b>C'</b> with its simplification
<b>P'</b>. In the process, drop parents that are ancestors
of other parents or that are root commits TREESAME to an
empty tree, and remove duplicates, but take care to never
drop all parents that we are TREESAME to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; If after
this parent rewriting, <b>C'</b> is a root or merge commit
(has zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or
!TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its
only parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The effect of
this is best shown by way of comparing to
<b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b> with parent
rewriting. The example turns into:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">.&minus;A&minus;&minus;&minus;M&minus;&minus;&minus;N&minus;&minus;&minus;O
<br>
/ / / <br>
I B D <br>
\ / / <br>

&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the major
differences in <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b> over
<b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>N</b>'s parent list had <b>I</b> removed, because it is
an ancestor of the other parent <b>M</b>. Still, <b>N</b>
remained because it is !TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>P</b>'s parent list similarly had <b>I</b> removed.
<b>P</b> was then removed completely, because it had one
parent and is TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">&bull;
<b>Q</b>'s parent list had <b>Y</b> simplified to <b>X</b>.
<b>X</b> was then removed, because it was a TREESAME root.
<b>Q</b> was then removed completely, because it had one
parent and is TREESAME.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is
another simplification mode available:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ancestry&minus;path[=&lt;commit&gt;]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Limit the displayed commits to
those which are an ancestor of &lt;commit&gt;, or which are
a descendant of &lt;commit&gt;, or are &lt;commit&gt;
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As an example
use case, consider the following commit history:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">D&minus;&minus;&minus;E&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;F
<br>
/ \ \ <br>

B&minus;&minus;&minus;C&minus;&minus;&minus;G&minus;&minus;&minus;H&minus;&minus;&minus;I&minus;&minus;&minus;J
<br>
/ \ <br>

A&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;K&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;L&minus;&minus;M</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A regular
<i>D..M</i> computes the set of commits that are ancestors
of <b>M</b>, but excludes the ones that are ancestors of
<b>D</b>. This is useful to see what happened to the history
leading to <b>M</b> since <b>D</b>, in the sense that
&ldquo;what does <b>M</b> have that did not exist in
<b>D</b>&rdquo;. The result in this example would be all the
commits, except <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (and <b>D</b> itself,
of course).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When we want to
find out what commits in <b>M</b> are contaminated with the
bug introduced by <b>D</b> and need fixing, however, we
might want to view only the subset of <i>D..M</i> that are
actually descendants of <b>D</b>, i.e. excluding <b>C</b>
and <b>K</b>. This is exactly what the
<b>&minus;&minus;ancestry&minus;path</b> option does.
Applied to the <i>D..M</i> range, it results in:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">E&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;F
<br>
\ \ <br>

G&minus;&minus;&minus;H&minus;&minus;&minus;I&minus;&minus;&minus;J
<br>
\ <br>
L&minus;&minus;M</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">We can also use
<b>&minus;&minus;ancestry&minus;path=D</b> instead of
<b>&minus;&minus;ancestry&minus;path</b> which means the
same thing when applied to the <i>D..M</i> range but is just
more explicit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If we instead
are interested in a given topic within this range, and all
commits affected by that topic, we may only want to view the
subset of <b>D..M</b> which contain that topic in their
ancestry path. So, using
<b>&minus;&minus;ancestry&minus;path=H D..M</b> for example
would result in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">E <br>
\ <br>

G&minus;&minus;&minus;H&minus;&minus;&minus;I&minus;&minus;&minus;J
<br>
\ <br>
L&minus;&minus;M</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Whereas
<b>&minus;&minus;ancestry&minus;path=K D..M</b> would result
in</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">K&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;L&minus;&minus;M</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before
discussing another option,
<b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;pulls</b>, we need to create a
new example history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A common
problem users face when looking at simplified history is
that a commit they know changed a file somehow does not
appear in the file&rsquo;s simplified history. Let&rsquo;s
demonstrate a new example and show how options such as
<b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;simplify&minus;merges</b> works in that
case:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">.&minus;A&minus;&minus;&minus;M&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;C&minus;&minus;N&minus;&minus;&minus;O&minus;&minus;&minus;P
<br>
/ / \ \ \/ / / <br>
I B \ R&minus;'&lsquo;&minus;Z' / <br>
\ / \/ / <br>
\ / /\ / <br>
&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&minus;X&minus;&minus;'
&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&minus;Y&minus;&minus;'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For this
example, suppose <b>I</b> created <b>file.txt</b> which was
modified by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b> in different
ways. The single&minus;parent commits <b>C</b>, <b>Z</b>,
and <b>Y</b> do not change <b>file.txt</b>. The merge commit
<b>M</b> was created by resolving the merge conflict to
include both changes from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and hence is
not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <b>R</b>, however,
was created by ignoring the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at
<b>M</b> and taking only the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at
<b>X</b>. Hence, <b>R</b> is TREESAME to <b>X</b> but not
<b>M</b>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create
<b>N</b> is to take the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at
<b>R</b>, so <b>N</b> is TREESAME to <b>R</b> but not
<b>C</b>. The merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> are
TREESAME to their first parents, but not to their second
parents, <b>Z</b> and <b>Y</b> respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
default mode, <b>N</b> and <b>R</b> both have a TREESAME
parent, so those edges are walked and the others are
ignored. The resulting history graph is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">I&minus;&minus;&minus;X</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using
<b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b>, Git walks every
edge. This will discover the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>
and the merge <b>M</b>, but also will reveal the merge
commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b>. With parent rewriting, the
resulting graph is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">.&minus;A&minus;&minus;&minus;M&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;N&minus;&minus;&minus;O&minus;&minus;&minus;P
<br>
/ / \ \ \/ / / <br>
I B \ R&minus;'&lsquo;&minus;&minus;' / <br>
\ / \/ / <br>
\ / /\ / <br>
&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&minus;X&minus;&minus;'
&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;&minus;'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here, the merge
commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> contribute extra noise, as
they did not actually contribute a change to
<b>file.txt</b>. They only merged a topic that was based on
an older version of <b>file.txt</b>. This is a common issue
in repositories using a workflow where many contributors
work in parallel and merge their topic branches along a
single trunk: many unrelated merges appear in the
<b>&minus;&minus;full&minus;history</b> results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When using the
<b>&minus;&minus;simplify&minus;merges</b> option, the
commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> disappear from the results.
This is because the rewritten second parents of <b>O</b> and
<b>P</b> are reachable from their first parents. Those edges
are removed and then the commits look like
single&minus;parent commits that are TREESAME to their
parent. This also happens to the commit <b>N</b>, resulting
in a history view as follows:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">.&minus;A&minus;&minus;&minus;M&minus;&minus;.
<br>
/ / \ <br>
I B R <br>
\ / / <br>
\ / / <br>
&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&minus;X&minus;&minus;'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this view,
we see all of the important single&minus;parent changes from
<b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b>. We also see the
carefully&minus;resolved merge <b>M</b> and the
not&minus;so&minus;carefully&minus;resolved merge <b>R</b>.
This is usually enough information to determine why the
commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> &quot;disappeared&quot; from
history in the default view. However, there are a few issues
with this approach.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first issue
is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
<b>&minus;&minus;simplify&minus;merges</b> option requires
walking the entire commit history before returning a single
result. This can make the option difficult to use for very
large repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The second
issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are working
on the same repository, it is important which merge commits
introduced a change into an important branch. The
problematic merge <b>R</b> above is not likely to be the
merge commit that was used to merge into an important
branch. Instead, the merge <b>N</b> was used to merge
<b>R</b> and <b>X</b> into the important branch. This commit
may have information about why the change <b>X</b> came to
override the changes from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> in its
commit message.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;show&minus;pulls</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In addition to the commits
shown in the default history, show each merge commit that is
not TREESAME to its first parent but is TREESAME to a later
parent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When a merge
commit is included by <b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;pulls</b>,
the merge is treated as if it &quot;pulled&quot; the change
from another branch. When using
<b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;pulls</b> on this example (and
no other options) the resulting graph is:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">I&minus;&minus;&minus;X&minus;&minus;&minus;R&minus;&minus;&minus;N</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here, the merge
commits <b>R</b> and <b>N</b> are included because they
pulled the commits <b>X</b> and <b>R</b> into the base
branch, respectively. These merges are the reason the
commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> do not appear in the default
history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>&minus;&minus;show&minus;pulls</b> is paired with
<b>&minus;&minus;simplify&minus;merges</b>, the graph
includes all of the necessary information:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">.&minus;A&minus;&minus;&minus;M&minus;&minus;.
N <br>
/ / \ / <br>
I B R <br>
\ / / <br>
\ / / <br>
&lsquo;&minus;&minus;&minus;X&minus;&minus;'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Notice that
since <b>M</b> is reachable from <b>R</b>, the edge from
<b>N</b> to <b>M</b> was simplified away. However, <b>N</b>
still appears in the history as an important commit because

option allows you to view only the big picture of the
topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not
