<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Introduction</b>
<br>
The dvidvi program converts a dvi file into another dvi
file, with perhaps certain changes.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Parameters</b>
<br>
-f n page n is first page selected <br>
-l n page n is last page selected</p>

<p style="margin-left:26%;">-n n select at most n pages.
Notice that n is the number of pages selected, independently
of the number of pages actually contained in a sheet <br>
-i { n1..n2 | n1 }[,...] <br>
include pages (ranges allowed). When this option is used,
ONLY the specified pages are selected. However, we can
exclude from these pages with the option -x <br>
-x { n1..n2 | n1 }[,...] <br>
exclude pages (ranges allowed) <br>
-q work in quiet mode, that is do not print in the screen
messages of how the work is being done. <br>
-r reverse the order of the pages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The page
numbers for the above options -f -l -i and -x can be
specified in different ways.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">1) If a number n is given, it
is interpreted as the n&rsquo;th page from the beginning of
the .dvi file. Of course, this number is independent of the
page number assigned by TeX. <br>
2) TeX page numbers are those who are actually written in
the page; these page numbers can be modified, for example,
by using the TeX commands \pagenumbering,
\setcounter{page}{n}, and \addtocounter{page}{n}. A TeX page
number can be specified by preceding the number n with the
character @. Thus, if you specify -f @25 -l @30 you select
the pages between 25 and 30, these numbers being those
assigned by TeX. <br>
3) However, several pages can have the same TeX page number
in a .dvi file. For example, the introductory pages in a
book are numbered i, ii, and so on until the first chapter
begins and then, the pages are numbered 1, 2, etc. In this
case, the pages numbered i and 1 in the .dvi file have the
same TeX page number. If you want to select for example the
second occurrence of the page numbered 1, you can specify a
page number as (@2)1. Thus @1 is equivalent to (@1)1. For
example, if you specify -f (@2)1 -l(@2)10 you select the
pages between 1 and 10 of the first chapter, not the
introductory pages between i and x.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is
another parameter that tells dvidvi how you want to change
page layout and specifications. This is the -m
parameter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">* The number preceding the
colon is the modulo value. Everything will be done in chunks
of pages this big. If there is no colon, than the default
value is assumed to be one. The last chunk of pages is
padded with as many blank pages as necessary. <br>
* Following the colon is a comma-separated list of page
numbers. These page numbers are with respect to the current
chunk of pages, and must lie in the range zero to the modulo
value less one. If a negative sign precedes the number, then
the page is taken from the mirror chunk; if there are m
chunks, then the mirror chunk of chunk n is the chunk
numbered m-n-1. Put simply, it is the chunk numbered the
same, only from the end. This can be used to reverse pages.
If no number is given, the page number defaults to 1. <br>
* Following each page number is an optional offset value in
parenthesis, which consists of a pair of comma-separated
dimensions. Each dimension is a decimal number with an
optional unit of measure. The default unit of measure is
inches, or the last unit of measure used. All units are in
true dimensions. Allowable units of measure are the same
that TeX allows: in, mm, cm, pt, pc, dd, and cc.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:26%; margin-top: 1em">-m - Reverses
the order of the pages. This time, both the modulo and the
page number are defaulted. <br>
-m 2:0 Selects the first, third, fifth, etc. pages from the
file. Print this one after printing the next, taking the
paper out of the feed tray and reinserting it into the paper
feed. <br>
-m 2:-1 Selects the second, fourth, etc. pages, and writes
them in reverse order. <br>
-m 4:-1,2(4.25in,0in) <br>
-m 4:-3,0(4.25in,0in) <br>
Useful for printing a little booklet, four pages to a sheet,
double-sided, for stapling in the middle. Print the first
one, put the stack back into the printer upside down, and
print the second. The &lsquo;in&rsquo; specifications are
superfluous. <br>
-m ,(1pt,1) <br>
Scare your system administrator! Actually, things are so
blurry with this option, you may want to send enemies
letters printed like this. *Long* letters. <br>
-m 4:0(5.5in,4.25),3(0,4.25) <br>
-m 4:1(0in,4.25),2(5.5,4.25) <br>
Print a four-page card on one sheet. Print the first, rotate
the paper 180 degrees and feed it again. (PostScript people
can do funny tricks with PostScript so this isn&rsquo;t
necessary.)</p>
