<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setup and
enable a security passphrase for one or more NVDIMMs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For this
command to succeed, it is expected that the master key has
previously been loaded into the user keyring. More
information on how this can be done can be found in the
kernel documentation at: <br>

&lt;https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/security/keys/trusted&minus;encrypted.html&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The passphrase
blobs are created in the /etc/ndctl/keys directory with a
file name format of
&quot;nvdimm_&lt;dimm&minus;unique&minus;id&gt;_&lt;hostname&gt;.blob&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
will fail if the passphrase is already in the user keyring
or if a passphrase blob already exists in
/etc/ndctl/keys.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS

</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;dimm&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A <i>nmemX</i> device name, or
a dimm id number. Restrict the operation to the specified
dimm(s). The keyword <i>all</i> can be specified to indicate
the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not
supplying a &minus;&minus;dimm option at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;b,
&minus;&minus;bus=</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A bus id number, or a provider
string (e.g. &quot;ACPI.NFIT&quot;). Restrict the operation
to the specified bus(es). The keyword <i>all</i> can be
specified to indicate the lack of any restriction, however
this is the same as not supplying a &minus;&minus;bus option
at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;k,
&minus;&minus;key_handle=</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Handle for the master
<i>kek</i> (key&minus;encryption&minus;key) that will be
used for sealing the passphrase(s) for the given DIMM(s).
The format is: &lt;key type&gt;:&lt;key description&gt; e.g.

<h2>THEORY OF OPERATION
<a name="THEORY OF OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Intel
Device Specific Methods (DSM) specification v1.7 and v1.8
[1] introduced the following security management operations:
enable passhprase, update passphrase, unlock DIMM, disable
security, freeze security, secure (crypto) erase, overwrite,
master passphrase enable, master passphrase update, and
master passphrase secure erase.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
management for NVDIMMs is comprised of two parts. The front
end uses the Linux key management framework (trusted and
encrypted keys [2]) to store the encrypted passphrases in
the kernel&minus;managed keyring. The interface for this is
the <i>keyutils</i> utility which uses the key management
APIs in the Linux kernel. The back end takes the decrypted
payload (which is the DIMM passphrase) and passes it to the
DIMM.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike other
DSMs which are composed by libndctl and sent to the kernel
via an ioctl, the security DSMs are managed through the
<i>security</i> sysfs attribute under the <i>dimm</i>
device. A <i>key&minus;ID</i> is written to the
<i>security</i> attribute and the kernel pulls the
associated key material from the user keyring that is
maintained by the kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The security
process begins with the generation of a <i>master key</i>
that is used to seal (encrypt) the passphrase for the DIMM.
There can either be one common <i>master key</i> that is
used to encrypt every DIMM&rsquo;s passphrase, or a separate
key can be generated for each DIMM. The <i>master key</i> is
also referred to as the
<i>key&minus;encryption&minus;key</i> (kek). The <i>kek</i>
can either be generated by the TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
on the system, or alternatively, the <i>System Master
Key</i> can also be used as the <i>kek</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For testing
purposes a user key with randomized payload can also be used
as a <i>kek</i>. See [2] for details. To perform any
security operations, it is expected that the <i>kek</i> has
been added to the kernel&rsquo;s user keyring as shown in
example below:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"># keyctl show
<br>
Session Keyring <br>
736023423 &minus;&minus;alswrv 0 0 keyring: _ses <br>
675104189 &minus;&minus;alswrv 0 65534 \_ keyring: _uid.0
<br>
680187394 &minus;&minus;alswrv 0 0 \_ trusted:
nvdimm&minus;master</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before
performing any of the security operations, all the regions
associated with the DIMM in question need to be disabled.
For the <i>overwrite</i> operation, in addition to the
<i>regions</i>, the <i>dimm</i> also needs to be
disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
sub&minus;sections describe specifics of each security
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>UNLOCK</b>
<br>
Unlock is performed by the kernel, however a preparation
step must happen before the unlock DSM can be issued by the
kernel. It is expected that from the initramfs, a setup
command (ndctl <i>load&minus;keys</i>) is executed before
the libnvdimm module is loaded by modprobe. This command
will inject the <i>kek</i> and the encrypted passphrases
into the kernel&rsquo;s user keyring. During the
<i>probe</i> of the libnvdimm driver, it will:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. Check the
security state of the device and see if the DIMM is
locked</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. Request the
associated encrypted passphrase from the kernel&rsquo;s user
key ring</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. Use the
<i>kek</i> to decrypt the passphrase</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. Create the
unlock DSM, copy the decrypted payload into the DSM</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. Issue the
DSM to unlock the DIMM</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the DIMM is
already unlocked, the kernel will attempt to revalidate the
passphrase. If we fail to revalidate the passphrase, the
kernel will freeze the security and disallow any further
security configuration changes. A kernel module parameter is
available to override this behavior.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SETUP USER
PASSPHRASE</b> <br>
To setup the passphrase for a DIMM, it is expected that the
<i>kek</i> to be used is present in the kernel&rsquo;s user
keyring. The <i>kek</i> encrypts the DIMM passphrase using
the <i>enc32</i> key format. The plaintext passphrase is
never provided by or made visible to the user. It is instead
randomly generated by the kernel and userspace does not have
access to it. Upon encryption, a binary blob of the
passphrase is written to the passphrase blob storage
directory (/etc/ndctl/keys). The user is responsible for
backing up the passphrase blobs to a secure location.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>UPDATE USER
PASSPHRASE</b> <br>
The update user passphrase operation uses the same DSM
command as enable user passphrase. Most of the work is done
on the key management side. The user has the option of
providing a new <i>kek</i> for the new passphrase, but
continuing to use the existing <i>kek</i> is also
acceptable. The following operations are performed for
<i>update&minus;passphrase</i>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. Remove the
encrypted passphrase from the kernel&rsquo;s user
keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. Rename the
passphrase blob to old.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. Load this
old passphrase blob into the keyring with an &quot;old&quot;
name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. Create the
new passphrase and encrypt with the <i>kek</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. Send DSM
with the old and new decrypted passphrases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">6. Remove old
passphrase and the passphrase blob from the keyring.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>REMOVE USER
PASSPHRASE</b> <br>
The <i>key&minus;ID</i> for the passphrase to be removed is
written to sysfs. The kernel then sends the DSM to disable
security, and the passphrase is then removed from the
keyring, and the associated passphrase blob is deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>CRYPTO
(SECURE) ERASE</b> <br>
This operation is similar to remove&minus;passphrase. The
kernel issues a WBINVD instruction before and after the
operation to ensure no data corruption from a stale CPU
cache. Use ndctl&rsquo;s sanitize&minus;dimm command with
the &minus;&minus;crypto&minus;erase option to perform this
operation.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>OVERWRITE</b>
<br>
This is invoked using &minus;&minus;overwrite option for
ndctl <i>sanitize&minus;dimm</i>. The overwrite operation
wipes the entire NVDIMM. The operation can take a
significant amount of time. NOTE: When the command returns
successfully, it just means overwrite has been successfully
started, and not that the overwrite is complete.
Subsequently, 'ndctl wait&minus;overwrite&rsquo;can be used
to wait for the NVDIMMs that are performing overwrite. Upon
successful completion of an overwrite, the WBINVD
instruction is issued by the kernel. If both
&minus;&minus;crypto&minus;erase and &minus;&minus;overwrite
options are supplied, then crypto&minus;erase is performed
before overwrite.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SECURITY
FREEZE</b> <br>
This operation does not require a passphrase. This will
cause any security command other than a status query to be
locked out until the next boot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>MASTER
PASSPHRASE SETUP, UPDATE, and CRYPTO ERASE</b> <br>
These operations are similar to the user passphrase enable
and update. The only difference is that a different
passphrase is used. The master passphrase has no relation to
the master key (<i>kek</i>) which is used for encryption of
either passphrase.</p>
