<h2>SCOPE
<a name="SCOPE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes the format of the <b>lesskey</b> source file,
which is used by <b>less</b> version 582 and later. In
previous versions of <b>less</b>, a separate program called
<b>lesskey</b> was used to compile the <b>lesskey</b> source
file into a format understood by <b>less</b>. This
compilation step is no longer required and the
<b>lesskey</b> program is therefore deprecated, although the
file format remains supported by <b>less</b> itself.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<b>lesskey</b> file specifies a set of key bindings and
environment variables to be used by subsequent invocations
of <b>less</b>.</p>

<h2>FILE FORMAT
<a name="FILE FORMAT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The input file
consists of one or more <i>sections</i>. Each section starts
with a line that identifies the type of section. Possible
sections are: <br>
#command</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Customizes command key
bindings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">#line-edit</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Customizes line-editing key
bindings.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Blank lines and
lines which start with a pound sign (#) are ignored, except
as noted below.</p>

<h2>COMMAND SECTION
<a name="COMMAND SECTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
section begins with the line</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#command</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the command
section is the first section in the file, this line may be
omitted. The command section consists of lines of the
form:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>string</i>
&lt;whitespace&gt; <i>action</i> [extra-string]
&lt;newline&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whitespace is
any sequence of one or more spaces and/or tabs. The
<i>string</i> is the command key(s) which invoke the action.
The <i>string</i> may be a single command key, or a sequence
of up to 15 keys. The <i>action</i> is the name of the less
action, from the list below. The characters in the
<i>string</i> may appear literally, or be prefixed by a
caret to indicate a control key. A backslash followed by one
to three octal digits may be used to specify a character by
its octal value. A backslash followed by certain characters
specifies input characters as follows:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-30457401.png" alt="Image grohtml-30457401.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">\k followed by
a single character represents the char(s) produced when one
of these keys is pressed:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-30457402.png" alt="Image grohtml-30457402.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">A backslash
followed by any other character indicates that character is
to be taken literally. Characters which must be preceded by
backslash include caret, space, tab and the backslash
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">An action may
be followed by an &quot;extra&quot; string. When such a
command is entered while running <b>less</b>, the action is
performed, and then the extra string is parsed, just as if
it were typed in to <b>less</b>. This feature can be used in
certain cases to extend the functionality of a command. For
example, see the &quot;{&quot; and &quot;:t&quot; commands
in the example below. The extra string has a special meaning
for the &quot;quit&quot; action: when <b>less</b> quits, the
first character of the extra string is used as its exit
status.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
input file describes the set of default command keys used by
<b>less</b>. Documentation on each command can be found in
the man page, under the key sequence which invokes the
command.</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-30457403.png" alt="Image grohtml-30457403.png"></p>

<h2>PRECEDENCE
<a name="PRECEDENCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Commands
specified by <b>lesskey</b> take precedence over the default
commands. A default command key may be disabled by including
it in the input file with the action &quot;invalid&quot;.
Alternatively, a key may be defined to do nothing by using
the action &quot;noaction&quot;. &quot;noaction&quot; is
similar to &quot;invalid&quot;, but <b>less</b> will give an
error beep for an &quot;invalid&quot; command, but not for a
&quot;noaction&quot; command. In addition, ALL default
commands may be disabled by adding this control line to the
input file:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#stop</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will cause
all default commands to be ignored. The #stop line should be
the last line in that section of the file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Be aware that
#stop can be dangerous. Since all default commands are
disabled, you must provide sufficient commands before the
#stop line to enable all necessary actions. For example,
failure to provide a &quot;quit&quot; command can lead to
frustration.</p>

<h2>LINE EDITING SECTION
<a name="LINE EDITING SECTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
line-editing section begins with the line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#line-edit</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
specifies new key bindings for the line editing commands, in
a manner similar to the way key bindings for ordinary
commands are specified in the #command section. The
line-editing section consists of a list of keys and actions,
one per line as in the example below.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
input file describes the set of default line-editing keys
used by <b>less</b>:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-30457404.png" alt="Image grohtml-30457404.png"></p>

<h2>LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<a name="LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The environment
variable section begins with the line</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#env</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Following this
line is a list of environment variable assignments. Each
line consists of an environment variable name, an equals
sign (=) and the value to be assigned to the environment
variable. White space before and after the equals sign is
ignored. Variables assigned in this way are visible only to
<b>less</b>. If a variable is specified in the system
environment and also in a lesskey file, the value in the
lesskey file takes precedence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the variable
name is followed by += rather than =, the string is appended
to the variable&rsquo;s existing value. This currently works
only if any += lines immediately follow the same
variable&rsquo;s original definition (with an = line),
without any intervening definitions of other variables. It
can append only to a variable defined earlier in the file;
it cannot append to a variable in the system
environment.</p>

<h2>CONDITIONAL CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONDITIONAL CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a line
begins with #version followed by a relational operator and a
version number, the remainder of the line is parsed if and
only if the running version of <b>less</b> (or
<b>lesskey</b>) matches the operator. This can be helpful if
a lesskey file is used by different versions of
<b>less</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
suppose that a new command named
&rsquo;sideways-search&rsquo; is added in <b>less</b>
version 777. Then the following line would assign the
command to the Q key, but only in versions of <b>less</b>
which support it. The line would be ignored by versions
earlier than 777.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#version &gt;=
777 Q sideways-search</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These six
operators are supported:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-30457405.png" alt="Image grohtml-30457405.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The #version
feature is not supported in <b>less</b> and <b>lesskey</b>
before version 594. In those older versions, all #version
lines are ignored.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLE
<a name="EXAMPLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
input file sets the &minus;i and &minus;S options when is
run and, on version 595 and higher, adds a
&minus;&minus;color option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#env</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="41%">


<p>LESS = &minus;i&nbsp;&minus;S</p></td>
<td width="54%">
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="41%">



<p>#version&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;595&nbsp;&nbsp;LESS&nbsp;+=&nbsp;&minus;&minus;color=Hkc</p> </td>

<h2>WARNINGS
<a name="WARNINGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On MS-DOS and
OS/2 systems, certain keys send a sequence of characters
which start with a NUL character (0). This NUL character
should be represented as \340 in a lesskey file.</p>
