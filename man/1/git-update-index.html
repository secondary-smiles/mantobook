<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Modifies the
index. Each file mentioned is updated into the index and any
<i>unmerged</i> or <i>needs updating</i> state is
cleared.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See also
<b>git-add</b>(1) for a more user&minus;friendly way to do
some of the most common operations on the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The way <i>git
update&minus;index</i> handles files it is told about can be
modified using the various options:</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;add</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a specified file isn&rsquo;t
in the index already then it&rsquo;s added. Default
behaviour is to ignore new files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;remove</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If a specified file is in the
index but is missing then it&rsquo;s removed. Default
behavior is to ignore removed file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;refresh</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Looks at the current index and
checks to see if merges or updates are needed by checking
stat() information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;q</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Quiet. If &minus;&minus;refresh
finds that the index needs an update, the default behavior
is to error out. This option makes <i>git
update&minus;index</i> continue anyway.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;submodules</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not try to update
submodules. This option is only respected when passed before
&minus;&minus;refresh.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;unmerged</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If &minus;&minus;refresh finds
unmerged changes in the index, the default behavior is to
error out. This option makes <i>git update&minus;index</i>
continue anyway.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;missing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Ignores missing files during a
&minus;&minus;refresh</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;cacheinfo
&lt;mode&gt;,&lt;object&gt;,&lt;path&gt;,
&minus;&minus;cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt; &lt;object&gt;
&lt;path&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Directly insert the specified
info into the index. For backward compatibility, you can
also give these three arguments as three separate
parameters, but new users are encouraged to use a
single&minus;parameter form.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;index&minus;info</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Read index information from
stdin.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;chmod=(+|&minus;)x</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the execute permissions on
the updated files.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]assume&minus;unchanged</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When this flag is specified,
the object names recorded for the paths are not updated.
Instead, this option sets/unsets the &quot;assume
unchanged&quot; bit for the paths. When the &quot;assume
unchanged&quot; bit is on, the user promises not to change
the file and allows Git to assume that the working tree file
matches what is recorded in the index. If you want to change
the working tree file, you need to unset the bit to tell
Git. This is sometimes helpful when working with a big
project on a filesystem that has very slow lstat(2) system
call (e.g. cifs).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Git will fail
(gracefully) in case it needs to modify this file in the
index e.g. when merging in a commit; thus, in case the
assumed&minus;untracked file is changed upstream, you will
need to handle the situation manually.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;really&minus;refresh</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like
<b>&minus;&minus;refresh</b>, but checks stat information
unconditionally, without regard to the &quot;assume
unchanged&quot; setting.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]skip&minus;worktree</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When one of these flags is
specified, the object name recorded for the paths are not
updated. Instead, these options set and unset the
&quot;skip&minus;worktree&quot; bit for the paths. See
section &quot;Skip&minus;worktree bit&quot; below for more
information.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]ignore&minus;skip&minus;worktree&minus;entries</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not remove
skip&minus;worktree (AKA &quot;index&minus;only&quot;)
entries even when the <b>&minus;&minus;remove</b> option was
specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]fsmonitor&minus;valid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When one of these flags is
specified, the object name recorded for the paths are not
updated. Instead, these options set and unset the
&quot;fsmonitor valid&quot; bit for the paths. See section
&quot;File System Monitor&quot; below for more
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;g,
&minus;&minus;again</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Runs <i>git
update&minus;index</i> itself on the paths whose index
entries are different from those from the <b>HEAD</b>
commit.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;unresolve</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Restores the <i>unmerged</i> or
<i>needs updating</i> state of a file during a merge if it
was cleared by accident.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;info&minus;only</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not create objects in the
object database for all &lt;file&gt; arguments that follow
this flag; just insert their object IDs into the index.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;force&minus;remove</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Remove the file from the index
even when the working directory still has such a file.
(Implies &minus;&minus;remove.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;replace</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, when a file
<b>path</b> exists in the index, <i>git
update&minus;index</i> refuses an attempt to add
<b>path/file</b>. Similarly if a file <b>path/file</b>
exists, a file <b>path</b> cannot be added. With
&minus;&minus;replace flag, existing entries that conflict
with the entry being added are automatically removed with
warning messages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;stdin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Instead of taking list of paths
from the command line, read list of paths from the standard
input. Paths are separated by LF (i.e. one path per line) by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;verbose</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Report what is being added and
removed from index.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;index&minus;version
&lt;n&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Write the resulting index out
in the named on&minus;disk format version. Supported
versions are 2, 3 and 4. The current default version is 2 or
3, depending on whether extra features are used, such as
<b>git add &minus;N</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Version 4
performs a simple pathname compression that reduces index
size by 30%&minus;50% on large repositories, which results
in faster load time. Version 4 is relatively young (first
released in 1.8.0 in October 2012). Other Git
implementations such as JGit and libgit2 may not support it
yet.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;z</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only meaningful with
<b>&minus;&minus;stdin</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;index&minus;info</b>; paths are separated
with NUL character instead of LF.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;split&minus;index,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;split&minus;index</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable or disable split index
mode. If split&minus;index mode is already enabled and
<b>&minus;&minus;split&minus;index</b> is given again, all
changes in $GIT_DIR/index are pushed back to the shared
index file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These options
take effect whatever the value of the <b>core.splitIndex</b>
configuration variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). But a
warning is emitted when the change goes against the
configured value, as the configured value will take effect
next time the index is read and this will remove the
intended effect of the option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;untracked&minus;cache,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;untracked&minus;cache</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable or disable untracked
cache feature. Please use
<b>&minus;&minus;test&minus;untracked&minus;cache</b> before
enabling it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These options
take effect whatever the value of the
<b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable (see
<b>git-config</b>(1)). But a warning is emitted when the
change goes against the configured value, as the configured
value will take effect next time the index is read and this
will remove the intended effect of the option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;test&minus;untracked&minus;cache</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Only perform tests on the
working directory to make sure untracked cache can be used.
You have to manually enable untracked cache using
<b>&minus;&minus;untracked&minus;cache</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;force&minus;untracked&minus;cache</b> or
the <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable
afterwards if you really want to use it. If a test fails the
exit code is 1 and a message explains what is not working as
needed, otherwise the exit code is 0 and OK is printed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;force&minus;untracked&minus;cache</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Same as
<b>&minus;&minus;untracked&minus;cache</b>. Provided for
backwards compatibility with older versions of Git where
<b>&minus;&minus;untracked&minus;cache</b> used to imply
<b>&minus;&minus;test&minus;untracked&minus;cache</b> but
this option would enable the extension unconditionally.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;fsmonitor,
&minus;&minus;no&minus;fsmonitor</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enable or disable files system
monitor feature. These options take effect whatever the
value of the <b>core.fsmonitor</b> configuration variable
(see <b>git-config</b>(1)). But a warning is emitted when
the change goes against the configured value, as the
configured value will take effect next time the index is
read and this will remove the intended effect of the
option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Do not interpret any more
arguments as options.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;file&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Files to act on. Note that
files beginning with <i>.</i> are discarded. This includes
<b>./file</b> and <b>dir/./file</b>. If you don&rsquo;t want
this, then use cleaner names. The same applies to
directories ending <i>/</i> and paths with <i>//</i></p>

<h2>USING &minus;&minus;REFRESH
<a name="USING &minus;&minus;REFRESH"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>&minus;&minus;refresh</b></i>
does not calculate a new sha1 file or bring the index up to
date for mode/content changes. But what it <b>does</b> do is
to &quot;re&minus;match&quot; the stat information of a file
with the index, so that you can refresh the index for a file
that hasn&rsquo;t been changed but where the stat entry is
out of date.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
you&rsquo;d want to do this after doing a <i>git
read&minus;tree</i>, to link up the stat index details with
the proper files.</p>

<h2>USING &minus;&minus;CACHEINFO OR &minus;&minus;INFO&minus;ONLY
<a name="USING &minus;&minus;CACHEINFO OR &minus;&minus;INFO&minus;ONLY"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;cacheinfo</b>
is used to register a file that is not in the current
working directory. This is useful for minimum&minus;checkout
merging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To pretend you
have a file at path with mode and sha1, say:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
update&minus;index &minus;&minus;add &minus;&minus;cacheinfo
&lt;mode&gt;,&lt;sha1&gt;,&lt;path&gt;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;info&minus;only</b>
is used to register files without placing them in the object
database. This is useful for status&minus;only
repositories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Both
<b>&minus;&minus;cacheinfo</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;info&minus;only</b> behave similarly: the
index is updated but the object database isn&rsquo;t.
<b>&minus;&minus;cacheinfo</b> is useful when the object is
in the database but the file isn&rsquo;t available locally.
<b>&minus;&minus;info&minus;only</b> is useful when the file
is available, but you do not wish to update the object
database.</p>

<h2>USING &minus;&minus;INDEX&minus;INFO
<a name="USING &minus;&minus;INDEX&minus;INFO"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;index&minus;info</b>
is a more powerful mechanism that lets you feed multiple
entry definitions from the standard input, and designed
specifically for scripts. It can take inputs of three
formats:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. mode SP type
SP sha1 TAB path</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This format is
to stuff <b>git ls&minus;tree</b> output into the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. mode SP sha1
SP stage TAB path</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This format is
to put higher order stages into the index file and matches
<i>git ls&minus;files &minus;&minus;stage</i> output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. mode SP sha1
TAB path</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This format is
no longer produced by any Git command, but is and will
continue to be supported by <b>update&minus;index
&minus;&minus;index&minus;info</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To place a
higher stage entry to the index, the path should first be
removed by feeding a mode=0 entry for the path, and then
feeding necessary input lines in the third format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
starting with this index:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
ls&minus;files &minus;s <br>
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 0 frotz</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">you can feed
the following input to
<b>&minus;&minus;index&minus;info</b>:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
update&minus;index &minus;&minus;index&minus;info <br>
0 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 frotz <br>
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1 frotz <br>
100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2 frotz</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first line
of the input feeds 0 as the mode to remove the path; the
SHA&minus;1 does not matter as long as it is well formatted.
Then the second and third line feeds stage 1 and stage 2
entries for that path. After the above, we would end up with
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git
ls&minus;files &minus;s <br>
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1 frotz <br>
100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2 frotz</p>

<h2>USING &ldquo;ASSUME UNCHANGED&rdquo; BIT
<a name="USING &ldquo;ASSUME UNCHANGED&rdquo; BIT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many operations
in Git depend on your filesystem to have an efficient
<b>lstat(2)</b> implementation, so that <b>st_mtime</b>
information for working tree files can be cheaply checked to
see if the file contents have changed from the version
recorded in the index file. Unfortunately, some filesystems
have inefficient <b>lstat(2)</b>. If your filesystem is one
of them, you can set &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit to
paths you have not changed to cause Git not to do this
check. Note that setting this bit on a path does not mean
Git will check the contents of the file to see if it has
changed &mdash; it makes Git to omit any checking and assume
it has <b>not</b> changed. When you make changes to working
tree files, you have to explicitly tell Git about it by
dropping &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit, either before or
after you modify them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to set
&quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit, use
<b>&minus;&minus;assume&minus;unchanged</b> option. To
unset, use
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;assume&minus;unchanged</b>. To see
which files have the &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit set,
use <b>git ls&minus;files &minus;v</b> (see
<b>git-ls-files</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
looks at <b>core.ignorestat</b> configuration variable. When
this is true, paths updated with <b>git update&minus;index
paths...</b> and paths updated with other Git commands that
update both index and working tree (e.g. <i>git apply
&minus;&minus;index</i>, <i>git checkout&minus;index
&minus;u</i>, and <i>git read&minus;tree &minus;u</i>) are
automatically marked as &quot;assume unchanged&quot;. Note
that &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit is <b>not</b> set if
<b>git update&minus;index &minus;&minus;refresh</b> finds
the working tree file matches the index (use <b>git
update&minus;index &minus;&minus;really&minus;refresh</b> if
you want to mark them as &quot;assume unchanged&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes users
confuse the assume&minus;unchanged bit with the
skip&minus;worktree bit. See the final paragraph in the
&quot;Skip&minus;worktree bit&quot; section below for an
explanation of the differences.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To update and
refresh only the files already checked out:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git

8.</b> you can tell about the change after the fact. <b><br>
9.</b> now it checks with lstat(2) and finds it has been
changed.</p>

<h2>SKIP&minus;WORKTREE BIT
<a name="SKIP&minus;WORKTREE BIT"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Skip&minus;worktree
bit can be defined in one (long) sentence: Tell git to avoid
writing the file to the working directory when reasonably
possible, and treat the file as unchanged when it is not
present in the working directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that not
all git commands will pay attention to this bit, and some
only partially support it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
update&minus;index flags and the read&minus;tree
capabilities relating to the skip&minus;worktree bit
predated the introduction of the
<b>git-sparse-checkout</b>(1) command, which provides a much
easier way to configure and handle the skip&minus;worktree
bits. If you want to reduce your working tree to only deal
with a subset of the files in the repository, we strongly
encourage the use of <b>git-sparse-checkout</b>(1) in
preference to the low&minus;level update&minus;index and
read&minus;tree primitives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The primary
purpose of the skip&minus;worktree bit is to enable sparse
checkouts, i.e. to have working directories with only a
subset of paths present. When the skip&minus;worktree bit is
set, Git commands (such as <b>switch</b>, <b>pull</b>,
<b>merge</b>) will avoid writing these files. However, these
commands will sometimes write these files anyway in
important cases such as conflicts during a merge or rebase.
Git commands will also avoid treating the lack of such files
as an intentional deletion; for example <b>git add
&minus;u</b> will not stage a deletion for these files and
<b>git commit &minus;a</b> will not make a commit deleting
them either.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Although this
bit looks similar to assume&minus;unchanged bit, its goal is
different. The assume&minus;unchanged bit is for leaving the
file in the working tree but having Git omit checking it for
changes and presuming that the file has not been changed
(though if it can determine without stat&rsquo;ing the file
that it has changed, it is free to record the changes).
skip&minus;worktree tells Git to ignore the absence of the
file, avoid updating it when possible with commands that
normally update much of the working directory (e.g.
<b>checkout</b>, <b>switch</b>, <b>pull</b>, etc.), and not
have its absence be recorded in commits. Note that in sparse
checkouts (setup by <b>git sparse&minus;checkout</b> or by
configuring core.sparseCheckout to true), if a file is
marked as skip&minus;worktree in the index but is found in
the working tree, Git will clear the skip&minus;worktree bit
for that file.</p>

<h2>SPLIT INDEX
<a name="SPLIT INDEX"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This mode is
designed for repositories with very large indexes, and aims
at reducing the time it takes to repeatedly write these
indexes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this mode,
the index is split into two files, $GIT_DIR/index and
$GIT_DIR/sharedindex.&lt;SHA&minus;1&gt;. Changes are
accumulated in $GIT_DIR/index, the split index, while the
shared index file contains all index entries and stays
unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All changes in
the split index are pushed back to the shared index file
when the number of entries in the split index reaches a
level specified by the splitIndex.maxPercentChange config
variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each time a new
shared index file is created, the old shared index files are
deleted if their modification time is older than what is
specified by the splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire config
variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid
deleting a shared index file that is still used, its
modification time is updated to the current time every time
a new split index based on the shared index file is either
created or read from.</p>

<h2>UNTRACKED CACHE
<a name="UNTRACKED CACHE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This cache is
meant to speed up commands that involve determining
untracked files such as <b>git status</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This feature
works by recording the mtime of the working tree directories
and then omitting reading directories and stat calls against
files in those directories whose mtime hasn&rsquo;t changed.
For this to work the underlying operating system and file
system must change the <b>st_mtime</b> field of directories
if files in the directory are added, modified or
deleted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can test
whether the filesystem supports that with the
<b>&minus;&minus;test&minus;untracked&minus;cache</b>
option. The <b>&minus;&minus;untracked&minus;cache</b>
option used to implicitly perform that test in older
versions of Git, but that&rsquo;s no longer the case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
enable (or disable) this feature, it is easier to use the
<b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable (see
<b>git-config</b>(1)) than using the
<b>&minus;&minus;untracked&minus;cache</b> option to <b>git
update&minus;index</b> in each repository, especially if you
want to do so across all repositories you use, because you
can set the configuration variable to <b>true</b> (or
<b>false</b>) in your <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b> just once and
have it affect all repositories you touch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable is
changed, the untracked cache is added to or removed from the
index the next time a command reads the index; while when
<b>&minus;&minus;[no&minus;|force&minus;]untracked&minus;cache</b>
are used, the untracked cache is immediately added to or
removed from the index.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before 2.17,
the untracked cache had a bug where replacing a directory
with a symlink to another directory could cause it to
incorrectly show files tracked by git as untracked. See the
&quot;status: add a failing test showing a
core.untrackedCache bug&quot; commit to git.git. A
workaround for that is (and this might work for other
undiscovered bugs in the future):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$ git &minus;c
core.untrackedCache=false status</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This bug has
also been shown to affect non&minus;symlink cases of
replacing a directory with a file when it comes to the
internal structures of the untracked cache, but no case has
been reported where this resulted in wrong &quot;git
status&quot; output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
cases where existing indexes written by git versions before
2.17 will reference directories that don&rsquo;t exist
anymore, potentially causing many &quot;could not open
directory&quot; warnings to be printed on &quot;git
status&quot;. These are new warnings for existing issues
that were previously silently discarded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As with the bug
described above the solution is to one&minus;off do a
&quot;git status&quot; run with
<b>core.untrackedCache=false</b> to flush out the leftover
bad data.</p>

<h2>FILE SYSTEM MONITOR
<a name="FILE SYSTEM MONITOR"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This feature is
intended to speed up git operations for repos that have
large working directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It enables git
to work together with a file system monitor (see
<b>git-fsmonitor--daemon</b>(1) and the
&quot;fsmonitor&minus;watchman&quot; section of
<b>githooks</b>(5)) that can inform it as to what files have
been modified. This enables git to avoid having to lstat()
every file to find modified files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When used in
conjunction with the untracked cache, it can further improve
performance by avoiding the cost of scanning the entire
working directory looking for new files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
enable (or disable) this feature, it is easier to use the
<b>core.fsmonitor</b> configuration variable (see
<b>git-config</b>(1)) than using the
<b>&minus;&minus;fsmonitor</b> option to <b>git
update&minus;index</b> in each repository, especially if you
want to do so across all repositories you use, because you
can set the configuration variable in your
<b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b> just once and have it affect all
repositories you touch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the
<b>core.fsmonitor</b> configuration variable is changed, the
file system monitor is added to or removed from the index
the next time a command reads the index. When
<b>&minus;&minus;[no&minus;]fsmonitor</b> are used, the file
system monitor is immediately added to or removed from the
index.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
honors <b>core.filemode</b> configuration variable. If your
repository is on a filesystem whose executable bits are
unreliable, this should be set to <i>false</i> (see
<b>git-config</b>(1)). This causes the command to ignore
differences in file modes recorded in the index and the file
mode on the filesystem if they differ only on executable
bit. On such an unfortunate filesystem, you may need to use
<i>git update&minus;index &minus;&minus;chmod=</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Quite
similarly, if <b>core.symlinks</b> configuration variable is
set to <i>false</i> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)), symbolic
links are checked out as plain files, and this command does
not modify a recorded file mode from symbolic link to
regular file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
looks at <b>core.ignorestat</b> configuration variable. See
<i>Using &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit</i> section
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
also looks at <b>core.trustctime</b> configuration variable.
It can be useful when the inode change time is regularly
modified by something outside Git (file system crawlers and
backup systems use ctime for marking files processed) (see
<b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The untracked
cache extension can be enabled by the
<b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable (see
<b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users often try
to use the assume&minus;unchanged and skip&minus;worktree
bits to tell Git to ignore changes to files that are
tracked. This does not work as expected, since Git may still
check working tree files against the index when performing
certain operations. In general, Git does not provide a way
to ignore changes to tracked files, so alternate solutions
are recommended.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
the file you want to change is some sort of config file, the
repository can include a sample config file that can then be
copied into the ignored name and modified. The repository
can even include a script to treat the sample file as a
template, modifying and copying it automatically.</p>
