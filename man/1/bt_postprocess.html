<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>btparse</b> parses a BibTeX entry, it initially stores
the results in an abstract syntax tree ( <small>AST</small>
), in a form exactly mirroring the parsed data. For example,
the entry</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@Article{Jones:1997a,
<br>
AuThOr = &quot;Bob Jones&quot; # and # &quot;Jim Smith
&quot;, <br>
TITLE = &quot;Feeding Habits of <br>
the Common Cockroach&quot;, <br>
JoUrNaL = j_ent, <br>
YEAR = 1997 <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">would parse to
an <small>AST</small> that could be represented as
follows:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(entry,&quot;Article&quot;)
<br>
(key,&quot;Jones:1997a&quot;) <br>
(field,&quot;AuThOr&quot;) <br>
(string,&quot;Bob Jones&quot;) <br>
(macro,&quot;and&quot;) <br>
(string,&quot;Jim Smith &quot;) <br>
(field,&quot;TITLE&quot;) <br>
(string,&quot;Feeding Habits of the Common Cockroach&quot;)
<br>
(field,&quot;JoUrNaL&quot;) <br>
(macro,&quot;j_ent&quot;) <br>
(field,&quot;YEAR&quot;) <br>
(number,&quot;1997&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The advantage
of this form is that all the important information in the
entry is readily available by traversing the tree using the
functions described in bt_traversal. This obvious problem is
that the data is a little too raw to be immediately useful:
entry types and field names are inconsistently capitalized,
strings are full of unwanted whitespace, field values not
reduced to single strings, and so forth.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All of these
problems are addressed by <b>btparse</b>&rsquo;s
post-processing functions, described here. Normally, you
won&rsquo;t have to call these
functions&minus;&minus;&minus;the library does the Right
Thing for you after parsing each entry, and you can
customize what exactly the Right Thing is for your
application. (For instance, you can tell it to expand
macros, but not to concatenate substrings together.)
However, it&rsquo;s conceivable that you might wish to move
the post-processing into your own code and out of the
library&rsquo;s control. More likely, you could have strings
that come from something other than BibTeX files that you
would like to have treated as BibTeX strings; for that
situation, the post-processing functions are essential.
Finally, you might just be curious about what exactly
happens to your data after it&rsquo;s parsed. If so,
you&rsquo;ve come to the right place for excruciatingly
detailed explanations.</p>

<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>btparse</b>
offers four points of entry to its post-processing code. Of
these, probably only the first and
last&minus;&minus;&minus;for processing individual strings
and whole entries&minus;&minus;&minus;will be commonly
used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Post-processing
entry points</b> <br>
To understand why four entry points are offered, an
explanation of the sample <small>AST</small> shown above
will help. First of all, the whole entry is represented by
the &quot;(entry,&quot;Article&quot;)&quot; node; this node
has the entry key and all its field/value pairs as children.
Entry nodes are returned by &quot;bt_parse_entry()&quot; and
&quot;bt_parse_entry_s()&quot; (see bt_input) as well as
&quot;bt_next_entry()&quot; (which traverses a list of
entries returned from
&quot;bt_parse_file()&quot;&minus;&minus;&minus;see
bt_traversal). Whole entries may be post-processed with
&quot;bt_postprocess_entry()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may also
need to post-process a single field, or just the value
associated with it. (The difference is that processing the
field can change the field name&minus;&minus;&minus;e.g. to
lowercase&minus;&minus;&minus;in addition to the field
value.) The &quot;(field,&quot;AuThOr&quot;)&quot; node
above is an example of a field sub-AST, and
&quot;(string,&quot;Bob Jones&quot;)&quot; is the first node
in the list of simple values representing that field&rsquo;s
value. (Recall that a field value is, in general, a list of
simple values.) Field nodes are returned by
&quot;bt_next_field()&quot;, value nodes by
&quot;bt_next_value()&quot;. The former may be passed to
&quot;bt_postprocess_field()&quot; for post-processing, the
latter to &quot;bt_postprocess_value()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Finally,
individual strings may wander into your program from many
places other than a <b>btparse</b> <small>AST.</small> For
that reason, &quot;bt_postprocess_string()&quot; is
available for post-processing arbitrary strings.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Post-processing
options</b> <br>
All of the post-processing routines have an
&quot;options&quot; parameter, which you can use to
fine-tune the post-processing. (This is just like the
per-metatype string-processing options that you can set
before parsing entries; see &quot;bt_set_stringopts()&quot;
in bt_input.) Like elsewhere in the library,
&quot;options&quot; is a bitmap constructed by or&rsquo;ing
together various predefined constants. These constants and
their effects are documented in &quot;String processing
option macros&quot; in btparse. <br>
bt_postprocess_string ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">void bt_postprocess_string
(char * s, <br>
btshort options)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Post-processes
an individual string, &quot;s&quot;, which is modified in
place. The only post-processing option that makes sense on
individual strings is whether to collapse whitespace
according to the BibTeX rules; thus, if &quot;options &amp;
BTO_COLLAPSE&quot; is false, this function has no effect.
(Although it makes a complete pass over the string anyways.
This is for future expansion.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The exact rules
for collapsing whitespace are simple: non-space whitespace
characters (tabs and newlines mainly) are converted to
space, any strings of more than one space within are
collapsed to a single space, and any leading or trailing
spaces are deleted. (Ensuring that all whitespace is spaces
is actually done by <b>btparse</b>&rsquo;s lexical scanner,
so strings in <b>btparse</b> ASTs will never have whitespace
apart from space. Likewise, any strings passed to
<b>bt_postprocess_string()</b> should not contain non-space
whitespace characters.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bt_postprocess_value ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">char * bt_postprocess_value
(AST * value, <br>
btshort options, <br>
boolean replace);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Post-processes
a single field value, which is the head of a list of simple
values as returned by &quot;bt_next_value()&quot;. All of
the relevant string-processing options come into play here:
conversion of numbers to strings (&quot;BTO_CONVERT&quot;),
macro expansion (&quot;BTO_EXPAND&quot;), collapsing of
whitespace (&quot;BTO_COLLAPSE&quot;), and string pasting
(&quot;BTO_PASTE&quot;). Since pasting substrings together
without first expanding macros and converting numbers would
be nonsensical, attempting to do so is a fatal error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;replace&quot; is true, then the list headed by
&quot;value&quot; will be replaced by a list representing
the processed value. That is, if string pasting is turned on
(&quot;options &amp; BTO_PASTE&quot; is true), then this
list will be collapsed to a single node containing the
single string that results from pasting together all the
substrings. If string pasting is not on, then each node in
the list will be left intact, but will have its text
replaced by processed text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If
&quot;replace&quot; is false, then a new string will be
built on the fly and returned by the function. Note that if
pasting is not on in this case, you will only get the last
string in the list. (It doesn&rsquo;t really make a lot of
sense to post-process a value without pasting unless
you&rsquo;re replacing it with the new value, though.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
string that resulted from processing the whole value, which
only makes sense if pasting was on or there was only one
value in the list. If a multiple-value list was processed
without pasting, the last string in the list is returned
(after processing).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Consider what
might be done to the value of the &quot;author&quot; field
in the above example, which is the concatenation of a
string, a macro, and another string. Assume that the macro
&quot;and&quot; expands to &quot; and &quot;, and that the
variable &quot;value&quot; points to the sub-AST for this
value. The original sub-AST corresponding to this value
is</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(string,&quot;Bob
Jones&quot;) <br>
(macro,&quot;and&quot;) <br>
(string,&quot;Jim Smith &quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To fully
process this value in-place, you would call</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">bt_postprocess_value
(value, BTO_FULL, TRUE);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This would
convert the value to a single-element list,</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(string,&quot;Bob
Jones and Jim Smith&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">and return the
fully-processed string &quot;Bob Jones and Jim Smith&quot;.
Note that the &quot;and&quot; macro has been expanded,
interpolated between the two literal strings, everything
pasted together, and finally whitespace collapsed.
(Collapsing whitespace before concatenating the strings
would be a bad idea.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(Incidentally,
&quot;BTO_FULL&quot; is just a macro for the combination of
all possible string-processing options, currently:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">BTO_CONVERT |
BTO_EXPAND | BTO_PASTE | BTO_COLLAPSE</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
other similar shortcut macros: &quot;BTO_MACRO&quot; to
express the special string-processing done on macro values,
which is the same as &quot;BTO_FULL&quot; except for the
absence of &quot;BTO_COLLAPSE&quot;; and
&quot;BTO_MINIMAL&quot;, which means no string-processing is
to be done.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Let&rsquo;s say
you&rsquo;d rather preserve the list nature of the value,
while expanding macros and converting any numbers to
strings. (This conversion is trivial: it just changes the
type of the node from &quot;BTAST_NUMBER&quot; to
&quot;BTAST_STRING&quot;. &quot;Number&quot; values are
always stored as a string of digits, just as they appear in
the file.) This would be done with the call</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">bt_postprocess_value
<br>
(value, BTO_CONVERT|BTO_EXPAND|BTO_COLLAPSE,TRUE);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">which would
change the list to</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(string,&quot;Bob
Jones&quot;) <br>
(string,&quot;and&quot;) <br>
(string,&quot;Jim Smith&quot;)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
whitespace is collapsed here <i>before</i> any concatenation
can be done; this is probably a bad idea. But you can do it
if you wish. (If you get any ideas about cooking up your own
value post-processing scheme by doing it in little steps
like this, take a look at the source to
&quot;bt_postprocess_value()&quot;; it should dissuade you
from such a venture.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bt_postprocess_field ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">char * bt_postprocess_field
(AST * field, <br>
btshort options, <br>
boolean replace);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is little
more than a front-end to &quot;bt_postprocess_value()&quot;;
the only difference is that you pass it a &quot;field&quot;
<small>AST</small> node (eg. the
&quot;(field,&quot;AuThOr&quot;)&quot; in the above
example), and that it transforms the field name in addition
to its value. In particular, the field name is forced to
lowercase; this behaviour is (currently) not optional.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Returns the
string returned by &quot;bt_postprocess_value()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bt_postprocess_entry ()</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">void bt_postprocess_entry (AST
* entry, <br>
btshort options);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Post-processes
all values in an entry. If &quot;entry&quot; points to the
<small>AST</small> for a &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;macro
definition&quot; entry, then the values are just what
you&rsquo;d expect: everything on the right-hand side of a
field or macro &quot;assignment.&quot; You can also
post-process comment and preamble entries, though. Comment
entries are essentially one big string, so only whitespace
collapsing makes sense on them. Preambles may have multiple
strings pasted together, so all the string-processing
options apply to them. (And there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent
you from using macros in a preamble.)</p>
