<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl5303delta
&minus; what is new for perl v5.30.3</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes differences between the 5.30.2 release and the
5.30.3 release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.30.1, first read
perl5302delta, which describes differences between 5.30.1
and 5.30.2.</p>

<h2>Security

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>[
<small>CVE&minus;2020&minus;10543</small> ] Buffer overflow
caused by a crafted regular expression</b> <br>
A signed &quot;size_t&quot; integer overflow in the storage
space calculations for nested regular expression quantifiers
could cause a heap buffer overflow in Perl&rsquo;s regular
expression compiler that overwrites memory allocated after
the regular expression storage space with attacker supplied
data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The target
system needs a sufficient amount of memory to allocate
partial expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the
overflow occurring. This requirement is unlikely to be met
on 64&minus;bit systems.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Discovered by:
ManhND of The Tarantula Team, VinCSS (a member of
Vingroup).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>[
<small>CVE&minus;2020&minus;10878</small> ] Integer overflow
via malformed bytecode produced by a crafted regular
expression</b> <br>
Integer overflows in the calculation of offsets between
instructions for the regular expression engine could cause
corruption of the intermediate language state of a compiled
regular expression. An attacker could abuse this behaviour
to insert instructions into the compiled form of a Perl
regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Discovered by:
Hugo van der Sanden and Slaven Rezic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>[
<small>CVE&minus;2020&minus;12723</small> ] Buffer overflow
caused by a crafted regular expression</b> <br>
Recursive calls to &quot;S_study_chunk()&quot; by
Perl&rsquo;s regular expression compiler to optimize the
intermediate language representation of a regular expression
could cause corruption of the intermediate language state of
a compiled regular expression.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Discovered by:
Sergey Aleynikov.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Additional
Note</b> <br>
An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to
any of the above flaws if it evaluates regular expressions
supplied by the attacker. Evaluating regular expressions in
this fashion is known to be dangerous since the regular
expression engine does not protect against denial of service
attacks in this usage scenario.</p>

<h2>Incompatible Changes

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.30.3
represents approximately 3 months of development since Perl
5.30.2 and contains approximately 1,100 lines of changes
across 42 files from 7 authors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Excluding
auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
were approximately 350 lines of changes to 8 .pm, .t, .c and
.h files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl continues
to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
community of users and developers. The following people are
known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl
5.30.3:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Chris
&rsquo;BinGOs&rsquo; Williams, Hugo van der Sanden, John
Lightsey, Karl Williamson, Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Steve
Hay.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The list above
is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it
does not include the names of the (very much appreciated)
contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug
tracker.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many of the
changes included in this version originated in the
<small>CPAN</small> modules included in Perl&rsquo;s core.
We&rsquo;re grateful to the entire <small>CPAN</small>
community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<h2>Reporting Bugs
<a name="Reporting Bugs"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you find
what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
database at &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.
There may also be information at
&lt;https://www.perl.org/&gt;, the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
&lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;. Be sure to
trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the bug you
are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
&quot; <small>SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT
INFORMATION&quot;</small> in perlsec for details of how to
report the issue.</p>
