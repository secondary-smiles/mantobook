&minus; what is new for perl v5.8.1</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes differences between the 5.8.0 release and the
5.8.1 release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read
the perl58delta, which describes differences between 5.6.0
and 5.8.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In case you are
wondering about 5.6.1, it was bug-fix-wise rather identical
to the development release 5.7.1. Confused? This timeline
hopefully helps a bit: it lists the new major releases,
their maintenance releases, and the development
releases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">New Maintenance
Development <br>
5.6.0 2000&minus;Mar&minus;22 <br>
5.7.0 2000&minus;Sep&minus;02 <br>
5.6.1 2001&minus;Apr&minus;08 <br>
5.7.1 2001&minus;Apr&minus;09 <br>

<h2>Incompatible Changes
<a name="Incompatible Changes"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Hash
Randomisation</b> <br>
Mainly due to security reasons, the &quot;random
ordering&quot; of hashes has been made even more random.
Previously while the order of hash elements from
<b>keys()</b>, <b>values()</b>, and <b>each()</b> was
essentially random, it was still repeatable. Now, however,
the order varies between different runs of Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl has
never guaranteed any ordering of the hash keys</b>, and the
ordering has already changed several times during the
lifetime of Perl 5. Also, the ordering of hash keys has
always been, and continues to be, affected by the insertion
order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The added
randomness may affect applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One possible
scenario is when output of an application has included hash
data. For example, if you have used the Data::Dumper module
to dump data into different files, and then compared the
files to see whether the data has changed, now you will have
false positives since the order in which hashes are dumped
will vary. In general the cure is to sort the keys (or the
values); in particular for Data::Dumper to use the
&quot;Sortkeys&quot; option. If some particular order is
really important, use tied hashes: for example the
Tie::IxHash module which by default preserves the order in
which the hash elements were added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More subtle
problem is reliance on the order of &quot;global
destruction&quot;. That is what happens at the end of
execution: Perl destroys all data structures, including user
data. If your destructors (the <small>DESTROY</small>
subroutines) have assumed any particular ordering to the
global destruction, there might be problems ahead. For
example, in a destructor of one object you cannot assume
that objects of any other class are still available, unless
you hold a reference to them. If the environment variable
<small>PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</small> is set to a non-zero
value, or if Perl is exiting a spawned thread, it will also
destruct the ordinary references and the symbol tables that
are no longer in use. You can&rsquo;t call a class method or
an ordinary function on a class that has been collected that
way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hash
randomisation is certain to reveal hidden assumptions about
some particular ordering of hash elements, and outright
bugs: it revealed a few bugs in the Perl core and core
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To disable the
hash randomisation in runtime, set the environment variable
<small>PERL_HASH_SEED</small> to 0 (zero) before running
Perl (for more information see &quot;
<small>PERL_HASH_SEED&quot;</small> in perlrun), or to
disable the feature completely in compile time, compile with
&quot;&minus;DNO_HASH_SEED&quot; (see
<i><small>INSTALL</small></i> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec for
the original rationale behind this change.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>UTF&minus;8</small>
On Filehandles No Longer Activated By Locale</b> <br>
In Perl 5.8.0 all filehandles, including the standard
filehandles, were implicitly set to be in Unicode
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> if the locale settings indicated
the use of <small>UTF&minus;8.</small> This feature caused
too many problems, so the feature was turned off and
redesigned: see &quot;Core Enhancements&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Single-number
v&minus;strings are no longer v&minus;strings before
&quot;=&gt;&quot;</b> <br>
The version strings or v&minus;strings (see &quot;Version
Strings&quot; in perldata) feature introduced in Perl 5.6.0
has been a source of some confusion-- especially when the
user did not want to use it, but Perl thought it knew
better. Especially troublesome has been the feature that
before a &quot;=&gt;&quot; a version string (a &quot;v&quot;
followed by digits) has been interpreted as a v&minus;string
instead of a string literal. In other words:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%h = ( v65
=&gt; 42 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">has meant since
Perl 5.6.0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%h = ( 'A'
=&gt; 42 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(at least in
platforms of <small>ASCII</small> progeny) Perl 5.8.1
restores the more natural interpretation</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%h = ( 'v65'
=&gt; 42 );</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
multi-number v&minus;strings like v65.66 and 65.66.67 still
continue to be v&minus;strings in Perl 5.8.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>(Win32) The
&minus;C Switch Has Been Repurposed</b> <br>
The &minus;C switch has changed in an incompatible way. The
old semantics of this switch only made sense in Win32 and
only in the &quot;use utf8&quot; universe in 5.6.x releases,
and do not make sense for the Unicode implementation in
5.8.0. Since this switch could not have been used by anyone,
it has been repurposed. The behavior that this switch
enabled in 5.6.x releases may be supported in a transparent,
data-dependent fashion in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the new
life of this switch, see &quot; <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
no longer default under <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
locales&quot;, and &quot;&minus;C&quot; in perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>(Win32) The
/d Switch Of cmd.exe</b> <br>
Perl 5.8.1 uses the /d switch when running the cmd.exe shell
internally for <b>system()</b>, backticks, and when opening
pipes to external programs. The extra switch disables the
execution of AutoRun commands from the registry, which is
generally considered undesirable when running external
programs. If you wish to retain compatibility with the older
behavior, set <small>PERL5SHELL</small> in your environment
to &quot;cmd /x/c&quot;.</p>

<h2>Core Enhancements
<a name="Core Enhancements"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>UTF&minus;8</small>
no longer default under <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
locales</b> <br>
In Perl 5.8.0 many Unicode features were introduced. One of
them was found to be of more nuisance than benefit: the
automagic (and silent)
&quot;UTF&minus;8&minus;ification&quot; of filehandles,
including the standard filehandles, if the user&rsquo;s
locale settings indicated use of
<small>UTF&minus;8.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you had &quot;en_US.UTF&minus;8&quot; as your locale, your
<small>STDIN</small> and <small>STDOUT</small> were
automatically &quot; <small>UTF&minus;8&quot;,</small> in
other words an implicit binmode(..., &quot;:utf8&quot;) was
made. This meant that trying to print, say,
<b>chr</b>(0xff), ended up printing the bytes 0xc3 0xbf.
Hardly what you had in mind unless you were aware of this
feature of Perl 5.8.0. The problem is that the vast majority
of people weren&rsquo;t: for example in RedHat releases 8
and 9 the <b>default</b> locale setting is
<small>UTF&minus;8,</small> so all RedHat users got
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> filehandles, whether they wanted
it or not. The pain was intensified by the Unicode
implementation of Perl 5.8.0 (still) having nasty bugs,
especially related to the use of s/// and tr///. (Bugs that
have been fixed in 5.8.1)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore a
decision was made to backtrack the feature and change it
from implicit silent default to explicit conscious option.
The new Perl command line option &quot;&minus;C&quot; and
its counterpart environment variable
<small>PERL_UNICODE</small> can now be used to control how
Perl and Unicode interact at interfaces like I/O and for
example the command line arguments. See &quot;&minus;C&quot;
in perlrun and &quot; <small>PERL_UNICODE&quot;</small> in
perlrun for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unsafe
signals again available</b> <br>
In Perl 5.8.0 the so-called &quot;safe signals&quot; were
introduced. This means that Perl no longer handles signals
immediately but instead &quot;between opcodes&quot;, when it
is safe to do so. The earlier immediate handling easily
could corrupt the internal state of Perl, resulting in
mysterious crashes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
new safer model has its problems too. Because now an opcode,
a basic unit of Perl execution, is never interrupted but
instead let to run to completion, certain operations that
can take a long time now really do take a long time. For
example, certain network operations have their own blocking
and timeout mechanisms, and being able to interrupt them
immediately would be nice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore perl
5.8.1 introduces a &quot;backdoor&quot; to restore the
pre&minus;5.8.0 (pre&minus;5.7.3, really) signal behaviour.
Just set the environment variable
<small>PERL_SIGNALS</small> to &quot;unsafe&quot;, and the
old immediate (and unsafe) signal handling behaviour
returns. See &quot; <small>PERL_SIGNALS&quot;</small> in
perlrun and &quot;Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)&quot; in
perlipc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In completely
unrelated news, you can now use safe signals with
POSIX::SigAction. See &quot;POSIX::SigAction&quot; in
<small>POSIX</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tied Arrays
with Negative Array Indices</b> <br>
Formerly, the indices passed to &quot;FETCH&quot;,
&quot;STORE&quot;, &quot;EXISTS&quot;, and
&quot;DELETE&quot; methods in tied array class were always
non-negative. If the actual argument was negative, Perl
would call <small>FETCHSIZE</small> implicitly and add the
result to the index before passing the result to the tied
array method. This behaviour is now optional. If the tied
array class contains a package variable named
$NEGATIVE_INDICES which is set to a true value, negative
values will be passed to &quot;FETCH&quot;,
&quot;STORE&quot;, &quot;EXISTS&quot;, and
&quot;DELETE&quot; unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>local
${$x}</b> <br>
The syntaxes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">local ${$x}
<br>
local @{$x} <br>
local %{$x}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">now do localise
variables, given that the $x is a valid variable name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unicode
Character Database 4.0.0</b> <br>
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl
5.8 has been updated to 4.0.0 from 3.2.0. This means for
example that the Unicode character properties are as in
Unicode 4.0.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Deprecation
Warnings</b> <br>
There is one new feature deprecation. Perl 5.8.0 forgot to
add some deprecation warnings, these warnings have now been
added. Finally, a reminder of an impending feature
removal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>(Reminder)
Pseudo-hashes are deprecated (really)</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pseudo-hashes
were deprecated in Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl
5.10.0, see perl58delta for details. Each attempt to access
pseudo-hashes will trigger the warning
&quot;Pseudo&minus;hashes are deprecated&quot;. If you
really want to continue using pseudo-hashes but not to see
the deprecation warnings, use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">no warnings
'deprecated';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Or you can
continue to use the fields pragma, but please don&rsquo;t
expect the data structures to be pseudohashes any more.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>(Reminder)
5.005&minus;style threads are deprecated (really)</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">5.005&minus;style
threads (activated by &quot;use Thread;&quot;) were
deprecated in Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed after Perl 5.8,
see perl58delta for details. Each 5.005&minus;style thread
creation will trigger the warning &quot;5.005 threads are
deprecated&quot;. If you really want to continue using the
5.005 threads but not to see the deprecation warnings,
use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">no warnings
'deprecated';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>(Reminder)
The $* variable is deprecated (really)</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The $* variable
controlling multi-line matching has been deprecated and will
be removed after 5.8. The variable has been deprecated for a
long time, and a deprecation warning &quot;Use of $* is
deprecated&quot; is given, now the variable will just
finally be removed. The functionality has been supplanted by
the &quot;/s&quot; and &quot;/m&quot; modifiers on pattern
matching. If you really want to continue using the
$*&minus;variable but not to see the deprecation warnings,
use:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">no warnings
'deprecated';</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Miscellaneous
Enhancements</b> <br>
&quot;map&quot; in void context is no longer expensive.
&quot;map&quot; is now context aware, and will not construct
a list if called in void context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a socket
gets closed by the server while printing to it, the client
now gets a <small>SIGPIPE.</small> While this new feature
was not planned, it fell naturally out of PerlIO changes,
and is to be considered an accidental feature.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PerlIO::get_layers(
<small>FH</small> ) returns the names of the PerlIO layers
active on a filehandle.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">PerlIO::via
layers can now have an optional <small>UTF8</small> method
to indicate whether the layer wants to
&quot;auto&minus;:utf8&quot; the stream.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>utf8::is_utf8()</b>
has been added as a quick way to test whether a scalar is
encoded internally in <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
(Unicode).</p>

<h2>Modules and Pragmata
<a name="Modules and Pragmata"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Updated
Modules And Pragmata</b> <br>
The following modules and pragmata have been updated since
Perl 5.8.0: <br>
base <br>
B::Bytecode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In much better shape than it
used to be. Still far from perfect, but maybe worth a
try.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">B::Concise <br>
B::Deparse <br>
Benchmark</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">An optional feature,
&quot;:hireswallclock&quot;, now allows for high resolution
wall clock times (uses Time::HiRes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ByteLoader</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See B::Bytecode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">bytes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Now has bytes::substr.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="4%">


<p><small>CGI</small></p></td>
<td width="85%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">charnames</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One can now have custom
character name aliases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>CPAN</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">There is now a simple command
line frontend to the <small>CPAN</small> .pm module called
<i>cpan</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Data::Dumper</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A new option, Pair, allows
choosing the separator between hash keys and values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">DB_File <br>
Devel::PPPort <br>
Digest::MD5 <br>
Encode</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Significant updates on the
encoding pragma functionality (tr/// and the
<small>DATA</small> filehandle, formats).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a filehandle
has been marked as to have an encoding, unmappable
characters are detected already during input, not later
(when the corrupted data is being used).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The <small>ISO
8859&minus;6</small> conversion table has been corrected
(the 0x30..0x39 erroneously mapped to U+0660..U+0669,
instead of U+0030..U+0039). The <small>GSM 03.38</small>
conversion did not handle escape sequences correctly. The
<small>UTF&minus;7</small> encoding has been added (making
Encode feature-complete with Unicode::String).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">fields <br>
libnet <br>
Math::BigInt</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A lot of bugs have been fixed
since v1.60, the version included in Perl v5.8.0. Especially
noteworthy are the bug in Calc that caused div and mod to
fail for some large values, and the fixes to the handling of
bad inputs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Some new
features were added, e.g. the <b>broot()</b> method, you can
now pass parameters to <b>config()</b> to change some
settings at runtime, and it is now possible to trap the
creation of NaN and infinity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">As usual, some
optimizations took place and made the math overall a tad
faster. In some cases, quite a lot faster, actually.
Especially alternative libraries like Math::BigInt::GMP
benefit from this. In addition, a lot of the quite clunky
routines like <b>fsqrt()</b> and <b>flog()</b> are now much
much faster.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">MIME::Base64 <small><br>
NEXT</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Diamond inheritance now
works.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Net::Ping <br>
PerlIO::scalar</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Reading from non-string scalars
(like the special variables, see perlvar) now works.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">podlators <br>
Pod::LaTeX <br>
PodParsers <br>
Pod::Perldoc</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Complete rewrite. As a
side-effect, no longer refuses to startup when run by
root.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Scalar::Util</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">New utilities: refaddr,
isvstring, looks_like_number, set_prototype.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Storable</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Can now store code references
(via B::Deparse, so not foolproof).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">strict</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Earlier versions of the strict
pragma did not check the parameters implicitly passed to its
&quot;import&quot; (use) and &quot;unimport&quot; (no)
routine. This caused the false idiom such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use strict
qw(@ISA); <br>
@ISA = qw(Foo);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This however
(probably) raised the false expectation that the strict
refs, vars and subs were being enforced (and that @ISA was
somehow &quot;declared&quot;). But the strict refs, vars,
and subs are <b>not</b> enforced when using this false
idiom.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Starting from
Perl 5.8.1, the above <b>will</b> cause an error to be
raised. This may cause programs which used to execute
seemingly correctly without warnings and errors to fail when
run under 5.8.1. This happens because</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use strict
qw(@ISA);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">will now fail
with the error:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unknown
'strict' tag(s) '@ISA'</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The remedy to
this problem is to replace this code with the correct
idiom:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use strict;
<br>
use vars qw(@ISA); <br>
@ISA = qw(Foo);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Term::ANSIcolor <br>
Test::Harness</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Now much more picky about extra
or missing output from test scripts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Test::More <br>
Test::Simple <br>
Text::Balanced <br>
Time::HiRes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use of <b>nanosleep()</b>, if
available, allows mixing subsecond sleeps with alarms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">threads</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Several fixes, for example for
<b>join()</b> problems and memory leaks. In some platforms
(like Linux) that use glibc the minimum memory footprint of
one ithread has been reduced by several hundred
kilobytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">threads::shared</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Many memory leaks have been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unicode::Collate <br>
Unicode::Normalize <br>
Win32::GetFolderPath <br>
Win32::GetOSVersion</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Now returns extra
information.</p>

<h2>Installation and Configuration Improvements
<a name="Installation and Configuration Improvements"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Unix
standard Perl location, <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>, is no longer
overwritten by default if it exists. This change was very
prudent because so many Unix vendors already provide a
<i>/usr/bin/perl</i>, but simultaneously many system
utilities may depend on that exact version of Perl, so
better not to overwrite it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One can now
specify installation directories for site and vendor man and
<small>HTML</small> pages, and site and vendor scripts. See
<i><small>INSTALL</small></i> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One can now
specify a destination directory for Perl installation by
specifying the <small>DESTDIR</small> variable for
&quot;make install&quot;. (This feature is slightly
different from the previous &quot;Configure
&minus;Dinstallprefix=...&quot;.) See
<i><small>INSTALL</small></i> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">gcc versions
3.x introduced a new warning that caused a lot of noise
during Perl compilation: &quot;gcc
&minus;Ialreadyknowndirectory (warning: changing search
order)&quot;. This warning has now been avoided by Configure
weeding out such directories before the compilation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One can now
build subsets of Perl core modules by using the Configure
flags &quot;&minus;Dnoextensions=...&quot; and
&quot;&minus;Donlyextensions=...&quot;, see
<i><small>INSTALL</small></i> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Platform-specific
enhancements</b> <br>
In Cygwin Perl can now be built with threads
(&quot;Configure &minus;Duseithreads&quot;). This works with
both Cygwin 1.3.22 and Cygwin 1.5.3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In newer
FreeBSD releases Perl 5.8.0 compilation failed because of
trying to use <i>malloc.h</i>, which in FreeBSD is just a
dummy file, and a fatal error to even try to use. Now
<i>malloc.h</i> is not used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl is now
known to build also in Hitachi HI-UXMPP.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl is now
known to build again in LynxOS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mac <small>OS
X</small> now installs with Perl version number embedded in
installation directory names for easier upgrading of
user-compiled Perl, and the installation directories in
general are more standard. In other words, the default
installation no longer breaks the Apple-provided Perl. On
the other hand, with &quot;Configure
&minus;Dprefix=/usr&quot; you can now really replace the
Apple-supplied Perl (<b>please be careful</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Mac <small>OS
X</small> now builds Perl statically by default. This change
was done mainly for faster startup times. The Apple-provided
Perl is still dynamically linked and shared, and you can
enable the sharedness for your own Perl builds by
&quot;Configure &minus;Duseshrplib&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl has been
ported to <small>IBM</small> &rsquo;s <small>OS/400

<h2>Selected Bug Fixes
<a name="Selected Bug Fixes"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Closures,
eval and lexicals</b> <br>
There have been many fixes in the area of anonymous subs,
lexicals and closures. Although this means that Perl is now
more &quot;correct&quot;, it is possible that some existing
code will break that happens to rely on the faulty
behaviour. In practice this is unlikely unless your code
contains a very complex nesting of anonymous subs, evals and
lexicals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Generic
fixes</b> <br>
If an input filehandle is marked &quot;:utf8&quot; and Perl
sees illegal <small>UTF&minus;8</small> coming in when doing
&quot;&lt;FH&gt;&quot;, if warnings are enabled a warning is
immediately given &minus; instead of being silent about it
and Perl being unhappy about the broken data later. (The
&quot;:encoding(utf8)&quot; layer also works the same
way.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">binmode(
<small>SOCKET,</small> &quot;:utf8&quot;) only worked on the
input side, not on the output side of the socket. Now it
works both ways.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For threaded
Perls certain system database functions like
<b>getpwent()</b> and <b>getgrent()</b> now grow their
result buffer dynamically, instead of failing. This means
that at sites with lots of users and groups the functions no
longer fail by returning only partial results.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.8.0 had
accidentally broken the capability for users to define their
own uppercase&lt;&minus;&gt;lowercase Unicode mappings (as
advertised by the Camel). This feature has been fixed and is
also documented better.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In 5.8.0
this</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$some_unicode
.= &lt;FH&gt;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">didn&rsquo;t
work correctly but instead corrupted the data. This has now
been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tied methods
like <small>FETCH</small> etc. may now safely access tied
values, i.e. resulting in a recursive call to
<small>FETCH</small> etc. Remember to break the recursion,
though.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At startup Perl
blocks the <small>SIGFPE</small> signal away since there
isn&rsquo;t much Perl can do about it. Previously this
blocking was in effect also for programs executed from
within Perl. Now Perl restores the original
<small>SIGFPE</small> handling routine, whatever it was,
before running external programs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Linenumbers in
Perl scripts may now be greater than 65536, or 2**16. (Perl
scripts have always been able to be larger than that,
it&rsquo;s just that the linenumber for reported errors and
warnings have &quot;wrapped around&quot;.) While scripts
that large usually indicate a need to rethink your code a
bit, such Perl scripts do exist, for example as results from
generated code. Now linenumbers can go all the way to
4294967296, or 2**32.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
use mod_perl 2.x with Perl 5.8.1, you will need
mod_perl&minus;1.99_10 or higher. Earlier versions of

(mod_perl 1.x works fine.) You will also need Apache::Test
1.04 or higher.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many of the
rarer platforms that worked 100% or pretty close to it with
perl 5.8.0 have been left a little bit untended since their

there will be more failures on those platforms. Such
platforms include Mac <small>OS</small> Classic,

Redeclaration of &quot;sendpath&quot; with a different

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The warnings
show up both during the build of Perl and during certain
lib/ExtUtils tests that invoke the C compiler. The warning,
however, is not serious and can be ignored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>IRIX:</small>
t/uni/tr_7jis.t falsely failing</b> <br>
The test t/uni/tr_7jis.t is known to report failure under
&rsquo;make test&rsquo; or the test harness with certain
releases of <small>IRIX</small> (at least <small>IRIX
6.5</small> and MIPSpro Compilers Version 7.3.1.1m), but if
run manually the test fully passes.</p>

<small>OS X:</small> no usemymalloc</b> <br>
The Perl malloc (&quot;&minus;Dusemymalloc&quot;) does not
work at all in Mac <small>OS X.</small> This is not that
serious, though, since the native malloc works just
fine.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tru64: No
threaded builds with <small>GNU</small> cc (gcc)</b> <br>
In the latest Tru64 releases (e.g. v5.1B or later) gcc
cannot be used to compile a threaded Perl
(&minus;Duseithreads) because the system
&quot;&lt;pthread.h&gt;&quot; file doesn&rsquo;t know about
gcc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Win32:
sysopen, sysread, syswrite</b> <br>
As of the 5.8.0 release,
<b>sysopen()</b>/<b>sysread()</b>/<b>syswrite()</b> do not
behave like they used to in 5.6.1 and earlier with respect
to &quot;text&quot; mode. These built-ins now always operate
in &quot;binary&quot; mode (even if <b>sysopen()</b> was
passed the O_TEXT flag, or if <b>binmode()</b> was used on
the file handle). Note that this issue should only make a
difference for disk files, as sockets and pipes have always
been in &quot;binary&quot; mode in the Windows port. As this
behavior is currently considered a bug, compatible behavior
may be re-introduced in a future release. Until then, the
use of <b>sysopen()</b>, <b>sysread()</b> and
<b>syswrite()</b> is not supported for &quot;text&quot; mode
operations.</p>

be deprecated. The v&minus;less form (1.2.3) will become a

needed. The v&minus;ful version (v1.2.3) will become
obsolete. The equivalence of strings and v&minus;strings
(e.g. that currently 5.8.0 is equal to &quot;\5\8\0&quot;)
will go away. <b>There may be no deprecation warning for
