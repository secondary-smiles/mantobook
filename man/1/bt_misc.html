<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>bt_purify_string()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">void bt_purify_string (char *
string, btshort options);</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Purifies&quot;
a &quot;string&quot; in the BibTeX way (usually used for
generating sort keys). &quot;string&quot; is modified
in-place. &quot;options&quot; is currently unused; just set
it to zero for future compatibility. Purification consists
of copying alphanumeric characters, converting hyphens and
ties to space, copying spaces, and skipping (almost)
everything else.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;Almost&quot;
because &quot;special characters&quot; (used for accented
and non-English letters) are handled specially. Recall that
a BibTeX special character is any brace-group that starts at
brace-depth zero whose first character is a backslash. For
instance, the string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">{\foo bar}Herr
M\&quot;uller went from {P{\r r}erov} to {\AA}rhus</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">contains two
special characters: &quot;{\foo bar}&quot; and
&quot;\AA&quot;. Neither the &quot;\&quot;u&quot; nor the
&quot;\r r&quot; are special characters, because they are
not at the right brace depth.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Special
characters are handled as follows: if the control sequence
(the TeX command that follows the backslash) is recognized
as one of LaTeX&rsquo;s &quot;foreign letters&quot;
(&quot;\oe&quot;, &quot;\ae&quot;, &quot;\o&quot;,
&quot;\l&quot;, &quot;\ae&quot;, &quot;\ss&quot;, plus
uppercase versions), then it is converted to a reasonable
English approximation by stripping the backslash and
converting the second character (if any) to lowercase; thus,
&quot;{\AA}&quot; in the above example would become simply
&quot;Aa&quot;. All other control sequences in a special
character are stripped, as are all non-alphabetic
characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example the
above string, after &quot;purification,&quot; becomes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">barHerr Muller
went from Pr rerov to Aarhus</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Obviously,
something has gone wrong with the word &quot;P{\r
r}erov&quot; (a town in the Czech Republic). The accented
&lsquo;r&rsquo; should be a special character, starting at
brace-depth zero. If the original string were instead</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">{\foo bar}Herr
M\&quot;uller went from P{\r r}erov to {\AA}rhus</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">then the
purified result would be more sensible:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">barHerr Muller
went from Prerov to Aarhus</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the use of
a &quot;nonsense&quot; special character &quot;{\foo
bar}&quot;: this trick is often used to put certain text in
a string solely for generating sort keys; the text is then
ignored when the document is processed by TeX (as long as
&quot;\foo&quot; is defined as a no-op TeX macro). This
assumes, of course, that the output is eventually processed
by TeX; if not, then this trick will backfire on you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also,
&quot;bt_purify_string()&quot; is adequate for generating
sort keys when you want to sort according to
English-language conventions. To follow the conventions of
other languages, though, a more sophisticated approach will
be needed; hopefully, future versions of <b>btparse</b> will
address this deficiency.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>bt_change_case()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">void bt_change_case (char
transform, char * string, btshort options);</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Converts a
string to lowercase, uppercase, or &quot;non-book title
capitalization&quot;, with special attention paid to BibTeX
special characters and other brace-groups. The form of
conversion is selected by the single character
&quot;transform&quot;: 'u' to convert to uppercase, 'l' for
lowercase, and 't' for &quot;title capitalization&quot;.
&quot;string&quot; is modified in-place, and
&quot;options&quot; is currently unused; set it to zero for
future compatibility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Lowercase and
uppercase conversion are obvious, with the proviso that text
in braces is treated differently (explained below). Title
capitalization simply means that everything is converted to
lowercase, except the first letter of the first word, and
words immediately following a colon or sentence-ending
punctuation. For instance,</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Flying
Squirrels: Their Peculiar Habits. Part One</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">would be
converted to</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Flying
squirrels: Their peculiar habits. Part one</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Text within
braces is handled as follows. First, in a &quot;special
character&quot; (see above for definition), control
sequences that constitute one of LaTeX&rsquo;s non-English
letters are converted
appropriately&minus;&minus;&minus;e.g., when converting to
lowercase, &quot;\AE&quot; becomes &quot;\ae&quot;). Any
other control sequence in a special character (including
accents) is preserved, and all text in a special character,
regardless of depth and punctuation, is converted to
lowercase or uppercase. (For &quot;title
capitalization,&quot; all text in a special character is
converted to lowercase.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Brace groups
that are not special characters are left completely
untouched: neither text nor control sequences within
non-special character braces are touched.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A Guide to
\LaTeXe: Document Preparation ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">would, when
&quot;transform&quot; is 't' (title capitalization), be
converted to</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A guide to
\latexe: Document preparation ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">which is
probably not the desired result. A better attempt is</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A Guide to
{\LaTeXe}: Document Preparation ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">which
becomes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A guide to
{\LaTeXe}: Document preparation ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
go back and re-read the description of
&quot;bt_purify_string()&quot;, you&rsquo;ll discover that
&quot;{\LaTeXe}&quot; here is a special character, but not a
non-English letter: thus, the control sequence is stripped.
Thus, a sort key generated from this title would be</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A Guide to
Document Preparation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">...oops! The
right solution (and this applies to any title with a TeX
command that becomes actual text) is to bury the control
sequence at brace-depth two:</p>
