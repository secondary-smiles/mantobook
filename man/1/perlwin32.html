<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These are
instructions for building Perl under Windows 7 and
later.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before you
start, you should glance through the <small>README</small>
file found in the top-level directory to which the Perl
distribution was extracted. Make sure you read and
understand the terms under which this software is being
distributed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also make sure
you read &quot; <small>BUGS AND CAVEATS&quot;</small> below
for the known limitations of this port.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>INSTALL</small> file in the perl top-level has much
information that is only relevant to people building Perl on
Unix-like systems. In particular, you can safely ignore any
information that talks about &quot;Configure&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may also
want to look at one other option for building a perl that
will work on Windows: the <small>README</small> .cygwin
file, which give a different set of rules to build a perl
for Windows. This method will probably enable you to build a
more Unix-compatible perl, but you will also need to
download and use various other build-time and run-time
support software described in that file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This set of
instructions is meant to describe a so-called
&quot;native&quot; port of Perl to the Windows platform.
This includes both 32&minus;bit and 64&minus;bit Windows
operating systems. The resulting Perl requires no additional
software to run (other than what came with your operating
system). Currently, this port is capable of using one of the
following compilers on the Intel x86 and x86_64
architectures:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Microsoft
Visual C++ version 12.0 or later <br>
Intel C++ Compiler (experimental) <br>
Gcc by mingw.org gcc version 3.4.5&minus;5.3.0 <br>
Gcc by mingw&minus;w64.org gcc version 4.4.3 or later</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
last two of these are actually competing projects both
delivering complete gcc toolchain for <small>MS</small>
Windows: <br>
&lt;https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Delivers gcc toolchain building
32&minus;bit executables (which can be used both 32 and 64
bit Windows platforms)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&lt;http://mingw&minus;w64.org&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Delivers gcc toolchain
targeting both 64&minus;bit Windows and 32&minus;bit Windows
platforms (despite the project name
&quot;mingw&minus;w64&quot; they are not only 64&minus;bit
oriented). They deliver the native gcc compilers and
cross-compilers that are also supported by perl&rsquo;s
makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Microsoft
Visual C <small>++</small> compilers are also now being
given away free. They are available as &quot;Visual C
<small>++</small> 2013&minus;2022 Community Edition&quot;
and are the same compilers that ship with &quot;Visual C
<small>++</small> 2013&minus;2022 Professional&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Visual C
<small>++</small> 2013 is capable of <b>targeting</b>
<small>XP</small> and Windows Server 2003 but the build host
requirement is Windows 7/Windows Server 2012. For more
details see
https://docs.microsoft.com/en&minus;us/visualstudio/productinfo/vs2013&minus;compatibility&minus;vs
and
https://docs.microsoft.com/en&minus;us/visualstudio/productinfo/vs2013&minus;sysrequirements&minus;vs</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The MinGW64
compiler is available at &lt;http://mingw&minus;w64.org&gt;.
The latter is actually a cross-compiler targeting Win64.
There&rsquo;s also a trimmed down compiler (no java, or
gfortran) suitable for building perl available at:
&lt;http://strawberryperl.com/package/kmx/64_gcctoolchain/&gt;</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><small>NOTE:</small>
If you&rsquo;re using a 32&minus;bit compiler to build perl
on a 64&minus;bit Windows operating system, then you should
set the <small>WIN64</small> environment variable to
&quot;undef&quot;. Also, the trimmed down compiler only
passes tests when <small>USE_ITHREADS</small> *= define (as
opposed to undef) and when the <small>CFG</small> *= Debug
line is commented out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This port fully
supports MakeMaker (the set of modules that is used to build
extensions to perl). Therefore, you should be able to build
and install most extensions found in the <small>CPAN</small>
sites. See &quot;Usage Hints for Perl on Windows&quot; below
for general hints about this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Setting Up
Perl on Windows</b> <br>
Make</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">You need a &quot;make&quot;
program to build the sources. If you are using Visual C
<small>++</small> , you can use nmake supplied with Visual C
<small>++</small> . You may also use gmake instead of nmake.
Builds using gcc need gmake. nmake is not supported for gcc
builds. Parallel building is only supported with gmake, not
nmake.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Command Shell</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use the default &quot;cmd&quot;
shell that comes with Windows. Some versions of the popular
4DOS/NT shell have incompatibilities that may cause you
trouble. If the build fails under that shell, try building
again with the cmd shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Make sure the
path to the build directory does not contain spaces. The
build usually works in this circumstance, but some tests
will fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Microsoft Visual C
<small>++</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The nmake that comes with
Visual C <small>++</small> will suffice for building. Visual
C <small>++</small> requires that certain things be set up
in the console before Visual C <small>++</small> will
successfully run. To make a console box be able to run the C
compiler, you will need to beforehand, run
&quot;vcvarsall.bat x86&quot; to compile for x86&minus;32
and for x86&minus;64 &quot;vcvarsall.bat amd64&quot;. On a
typical install of a Microsoft C <small>++</small> compiler
product, these batch files will already be in your
&quot;PATH&quot; environment variable so you may just type
them without an absolute path into your console. If you need
to find the absolute path to the batch file, it is usually
found somewhere like C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual
Studio 14.0\VC. With some newer Microsoft C products
(released after ~2004), the installer will put a shortcut in
the start menu to launch a new console window with the
console already set up for your target architecture
(x86&minus;32 or x86&minus;64 or <small>IA64</small> ). With
the newer compilers, you may also use the older batch files
if you choose so.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Microsoft Visual C
<small>++</small> 2013&minus;2022 Community Edition</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These free versions of Visual C
<small>++</small> 2013&minus;2022 Professional contain the
same compilers and linkers that ship with the full versions,
and also contain everything necessary to build Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These packages
can be downloaded by searching in the Download Center at
&lt;https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&gt;.
(Providing exact links to these packages has proven a
pointless task because the links keep on changing so
often.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Install Visual
C <small>++</small> 2013&minus;2022 Community, then setup
your environment using, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">C:\Program
Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
12.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(assuming the
default installation location was chosen).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl should now
build using the win32/Makefile. You will need to edit that
file to set <small>CCTYPE</small> to one of
<small>MSVC120&minus;MSVC142</small> first.</p>

&lt;http://www.mingw&minus;w64.org/&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You also need
gmake. Usually it comes with MinGW but its executable may
have a different name, such as mingw32&minus;make.exe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
MinGW build currently fails with version 6.3.0 or later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note also that
the C <small>++</small> mode build currently fails with
MinGW 3.4.5 and 4.7.2 or later, and with MinGW64
64&minus;bit 6.3.0 or later.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Intel C <small>++</small>
Compiler</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Experimental support for using
Intel C <small>++</small> Compiler has been added. Edit
win32/Makefile and pick the correct <small>CCTYPE</small>
for the Visual C that Intel C was installed into. Also
uncomment __ICC to enable Intel C on Visual C support. To
set up the build environment, from the Start Menu run
<small>IA&minus;32</small> Visual Studio 20__ mode or Intel
64 Visual Studio 20__ mode as appropriate. Then run nmake as
usually in that prompt box.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Only Intel C
<small>++</small> Compiler v12.1 has been tested. Other
versions probably will work. Using Intel C <small>++</small>
Compiler instead of Visual C has the benefit of C99
compatibility which is needed by some <small>CPAN XS</small>
modules, while maintaining compatibility with Visual C
object code and Visual C debugging infrastructure unlike
<small>GCC.</small></p>

<p>Make sure you are in the &quot;win32&quot; subdirectory
under the perl toplevel. This directory contains a
&quot;Makefile&quot; that will work with versions of nmake
that come with Visual C <small>++</small> , and a
<small>GNU</small> make &quot;GNUmakefile&quot; that will
work for all supported compilers. The defaults in the gmake

flags. These are explained in the makefiles.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that it is
generally not a good idea to try to build a perl with
<small>INST_DRV</small> and <small>INST_TOP</small> set to a
path that already exists from a previous build. In
particular, this may cause problems with the
lib/ExtUtils/t/Embed.t test, which attempts to build a test
program and may end up building against the installed
perl&rsquo;s lib/CORE directory rather than the one being
tested.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You will have
to make sure that <small>CCTYPE</small> is set correctly and
that <small>CCHOME</small> points to wherever you installed
your compiler. For <small>GCC</small> this should be the
directory that contains the <i>bin</i>, <i>include</i> and
<i>lib</i> directories.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If building
with the cross-compiler provided by mingw&minus;w64.org
you&rsquo;ll need to uncomment the line that sets
<small>GCCCROSS</small> in the GNUmakefile. Do this only if
it&rsquo;s the cross-compiler &minus; ie only if the bin
folder doesn&rsquo;t contain a gcc.exe. (The cross-compiler
does not provide a gcc.exe, g++.exe, ar.exe, etc. Instead,
all of these executables are prefixed with
&rsquo;x86_64&minus;w64&minus;mingw32&minus;&rsquo;.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default
value for <small>CCHOME</small> in the makefiles for Visual
C <small>++</small> may not be correct for some versions.
Make sure the default exists and is valid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want
build some core extensions statically into perl&rsquo;s dll,
specify them in the <small>STATIC_EXT</small> macro.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Be sure to read
the instructions near the top of the makefiles
carefully.</p>

&quot;nmake&quot; if you are using that make).</p></td>

</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This should
build everything. Specifically, it will create perl.exe,
perl536.dll at the perl toplevel, and various other
extension dll&rsquo;s under the lib\auto directory. If the
build fails for any reason, make sure you have done the
previous steps correctly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To try
gmake&rsquo;s parallel mode, type &quot;gmake
&minus;j2&quot;, where 2, is the maximum number of parallel
jobs you want to run. A number of things in the build
process will run in parallel, but there are serialization
points where you will see just 1 <small>CPU</small> maxed
out. This is normal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
advanced enough with building C code, here is a suggestion
to speed up building perl, and the later &quot;make
test&quot;. Try to keep your <small>PATH</small>
environmental variable with the least number of folders
possible (remember to keep your C compiler&rsquo;s folders
there). &quot;C:\WINDOWS\system32&quot; or
&quot;C:\WINNT\system32&quot; depending on your
<small>OS</small> version should be first folder in
<small>PATH,</small> since &quot;cmd.exe&quot; is the most
commonly launched program during the build and later
testing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Testing Perl
on Windows</b> <br>
Type &quot;gmake test&quot; (or &quot;nmake test&quot;).
This will run most of the tests from the testsuite (many
tests will be skipped).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There should be
no test failures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you build
with Visual C <small>++</small> 2013 then three tests
currently may fail with Daylight Saving Time related
problems: <i>t/io/fs.t</i>,
<i>cpan/HTTP&minus;Tiny/t/110_mirror.t</i> and
<i>lib/File/Copy.t</i>. The failures are caused by bugs in
the <small>CRT</small> in <small>VC++ 2013</small> which are
fixed in <small>VC++2015</small> and later, as explained by
Microsoft here:
&lt;https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/811534/utime&minus;sometimes&minus;fails&minus;to&minus;set&minus;the&minus;correct&minus;file&minus;times&minus;in&minus;visual&minus;c&minus;2013&gt;.
In the meantime, if you need fixed &quot;stat&quot; and
&quot;utime&quot; functions then have a look at the
<small>CPAN</small> distribution Win32::UTCFileTime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you build
with Visual C <small>++</small> 2015 or later then
<i>ext/XS&minus;APItest/t/locale.t</i> may crash (after all
its tests have passed). This is due to a regression in the
Universal <small>CRT</small> introduced in the Windows 10
April 2018 Update, and will be fixed in the May 2019 Update,
as explained here:
&lt;https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/519486/setlocalelc&minus;numeric&minus;iso&minus;latin&minus;16&minus;fails&minus;then&minus;succee.html&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you build
with certain versions (e.g. 4.8.1) of gcc from mingw then
<i>ext/POSIX/t/time.t</i> may fail test 17 due to a known
bug in those gcc builds: see
&lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw/bugs/2152/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some test
failures may occur if you use a command shell other than the
native &quot;cmd.exe&quot;, or if you are building from a
path that contains spaces. So don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
running the tests from a emacs shell window, you may see
failures in op/stat.t. Run &quot;gmake test-notty&quot; in
that case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Furthermore,
you should make sure that during &quot;make test&quot; you
do not have any <small>GNU</small> tool packages in your
path: some toolkits like Unixutils include some tools
(&quot;type&quot; for instance) which override the Windows
ones and makes tests fail. Remove them from your path while
testing to avoid these errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To see the
output of specific failing tests run the harness from the t
directory:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"># assuming
you're starting from the win32 directory <br>
cd ..\win32 <br>
.\perl harness &lt;list of tests&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please report
any other failures as described under &quot; <small>BUGS AND
CAVEATS&quot;</small> .</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Installation
of Perl on Windows</b> <br>
Type &quot;gmake install&quot; (&quot;nmake install&quot;).
This will put the newly built perl and the libraries under
whatever &quot;INST_TOP&quot; points to in the Makefile. It
will also install the pod documentation under
&quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\lib\pod&quot; and
<small>HTML</small> versions of the same under
&quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\lib\pod\html&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use the Perl
you just installed you will need to add a new entry to your
<small>PATH</small> environment variable:
&quot;$INST_TOP\bin&quot;, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">set
PATH=c:\perl\bin;%PATH%</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you opted to
uncomment &quot;INST_VER&quot; and &quot;INST_ARCH&quot; in
the makefile then the installation structure is a little
more complicated and you will need to add two new
<small>PATH</small> components instead:
&quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\bin&quot; and
&quot;$INST_TOP\$INST_VER\bin\$ARCHNAME&quot;, e.g.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">set
PATH=c:\perl\5.6.0\bin;c:\perl\5.6.0\bin\MSWin32&minus;x86;%PATH%</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Usage Hints
for Perl on Windows</b> <br>
Environment Variables</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The installation paths that you
set during the build get compiled into perl, so you
don&rsquo;t have to do anything additional to start using
that perl (except add its location to your
<small>PATH</small> variable).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you put
extensions in unusual places, you can set
<small>PERL5LIB</small> to a list of paths separated by
semicolons where you want perl to look for libraries. Look
for descriptions of other environment variables you can set
in perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
control the shell that perl uses to run <b>system()</b> and
backtick commands via <small>PERL5SHELL.</small> See
perlrun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl does not
depend on the registry, but it can look up certain default
values if you choose to put them there unless disabled at
build time with <small>USE_NO_REGISTRY.</small> On Perl
process start Perl checks if
&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl&quot; and
&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl&quot; exist. If the
keys exists, they will be checked for remainder of the Perl
process&rsquo;s run life for certain entries. Entries in
&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl&quot; override entries
in &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl&quot;. One or more
of the following entries (of type <small>REG_SZ</small> or
<small>REG_EXPAND_SZ</small> ) may be set in the keys:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">lib&minus;$]
version&minus;specific standard library path to add to @INC
<br>
lib standard library path to add to @INC <br>
sitelib&minus;$] version&minus;specific site library path to
add to @INC <br>
sitelib site library path to add to @INC <br>
vendorlib&minus;$] version&minus;specific vendor library
path to add to @INC <br>
vendorlib vendor library path to add to @INC <br>
PERL* fallback for all %ENV lookups that begin with
&quot;PERL&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the $] in
the above is not literal. Substitute whatever version of
perl you want to honor that entry, e.g. 5.6.0. Paths must be
separated with semicolons, as usual on Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">File Globbing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">By default, perl handles file
globbing using the File::Glob extension, which provides
portable globbing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want
perl to use globbing that emulates the quirks of
<small>DOS</small> filename conventions, you might want to
consider using File::DosGlob to override the internal
<b>glob()</b> implementation. See File::DosGlob for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Using perl from the command
line</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you are accustomed to using
perl from various command-line shells found in
<small>UNIX</small> environments, you will be less than
pleased with what Windows offers by way of a command
shell.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The crucial
thing to understand about the Windows environment is that
the command line you type in is processed twice before Perl
sees it. First, your command shell (usually
<small>CMD.EXE</small> ) preprocesses the command line, to
handle redirection, environment variable expansion, and
location of the executable to run. Then, the perl executable
splits the remaining command line into individual arguments,
using the C runtime library upon which Perl was built.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is
particularly important to note that neither the shell nor
the C runtime do any wildcard expansions of command-line
arguments (so wildcards need not be quoted). Also, the
quoting behaviours of the shell and the C runtime are
rudimentary at best (and may, if you are using a
non-standard shell, be inconsistent). The only (useful)
quote character is the double quote (&quot;). It can be used
to protect spaces and other special characters in
arguments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The Windows
documentation describes the shell parsing rules here:
&lt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en&minus;us/windows&minus;server/administration/windows&minus;commands/cmd&gt;
and the C runtime parsing rules here:
&lt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en&minus;us/library/17w5ykft%28v=VS.100%29.aspx&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
further observations based on experiments: The C runtime
breaks arguments at spaces and passes them to programs in
argc/argv. Double quotes can be used to prevent arguments
with spaces in them from being split up. You can put a
double quote in an argument by escaping it with a backslash
and enclosing the whole argument within double quotes. The
backslash and the pair of double quotes surrounding the
argument will be stripped by the C runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The file
redirection characters &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;,
and &quot;|&quot; can be quoted by double quotes (although
there are suggestions that this may not always be true).
Single quotes are not treated as quotes by the shell or the
C runtime, they don&rsquo;t get stripped by the shell (just
to make this type of quoting completely useless). The caret
&quot;^&quot; has also been observed to behave as a quoting
character, but this appears to be a shell feature, and the
caret is not stripped from the command line, so Perl still
sees it (and the C runtime phase does not treat the caret as
a quote character).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Here are some
examples of usage of the &quot;cmd&quot; shell:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This prints two
doublequotes:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl &minus;e
&quot;print '\&quot;\&quot;' &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This does the
same:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl &minus;e
&quot;print \&quot;\\\&quot;\\\&quot;\&quot; &quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This prints
&quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; to the file
&quot;blurch&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl &minus;e
&quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; &gt; blurch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This prints
&quot;foo&quot; (&quot;bar&quot; disappears into
nowhereland):</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl &minus;e
&quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; nul</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This prints
&quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; into the file
&quot;blurch&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl &minus;e
&quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 1&gt; blurch</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This pipes
&quot;foo&quot; to the &quot;less&quot; pager and prints
&quot;bar&quot; on the console:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl &minus;e
&quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; | less</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This pipes
&quot;foo\nbar\n&quot; to the less pager:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl &minus;le

less</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This pipes

&quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; blurch |
less</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Discovering the
usefulness of the &quot;command.com&quot; shell on Windows
9x is left as an exercise to the reader :)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">One
particularly pernicious problem with the 4NT command shell
for Windows is that it (nearly) always treats a % character
as indicating that environment variable expansion is needed.
Under this shell, it is therefore important to always double
any % characters which you want Perl to see (for example,
for hash variables), even when they are quoted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Building Extensions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network ( <small>CPAN</small> ) offers a wealth of
extensions, some of which require a C compiler to build.
Look in &lt;https://www.cpan.org/&gt; for more information
on <small>CPAN.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that not
all of the extensions available from <small>CPAN</small> may
work in the Windows environment; you should check the
information at &lt;https://www.cpantesters.org/&gt; before
investing too much effort into porting modules that
don&rsquo;t readily build.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Most extensions
(whether they require a C compiler or not) can be built,
tested and installed with the standard mantra:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl
Makefile.PL <br>
$MAKE <br>
$MAKE test <br>
$MAKE install</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">where $MAKE is
whatever &rsquo;make&rsquo; program you have configured perl
to use. Use &quot;perl &minus;V:make&quot; to find out what
this is. Some extensions may not provide a testsuite (so
&quot;$MAKE test&quot; may not do anything or fail), but
most serious ones do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is important
that you use a supported &rsquo;make&rsquo; program, and
ensure Config.pm knows about it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
MakeMaker actually emits makefiles with different syntax
depending on what &rsquo;make&rsquo; it thinks you are
using. Therefore, it is important that one of the following
values appears in Config.pm:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">make='nmake' #
MakeMaker emits nmake syntax <br>
any other value # MakeMaker emits generic make syntax <br>
(e.g GNU make, or Perl make)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the value
doesn&rsquo;t match the &rsquo;make&rsquo; program you want
to use, edit Config.pm to fix it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a module
implements XSUBs, you will need one of the supported C
compilers. You must make sure you have set up the
environment for the compiler for command-line compilation
before running &quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot; or any
invocation of make.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a module
does not build for some reason, look carefully for why it
failed, and report problems to the module author. If it
looks like the extension building support is at fault,
report that with full details of how the build failed using
the GitHub issue tracker at
&lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Command-line Wildcard
Expansion</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The default command shells on
<small>DOS</small> descendant operating systems (such as
they are) usually do not expand wildcard arguments supplied
to programs. They consider it the application&rsquo;s job to
handle that. This is commonly achieved by linking the
application (in our case, perl) with startup code that the C
runtime libraries usually provide. However, doing that
results in incompatible perl versions (since the behavior of
the argv expansion code differs depending on the compiler,
and it is even buggy on some compilers). Besides, it may be
a source of frustration if you use such a perl binary with
an alternate shell that *does* expand wildcards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Instead, the
following solution works rather well. The nice things about
it are 1) you can start using it right away; 2) it is more
powerful, because it will do the right thing with a pattern
like */*/*.c; 3) you can decide whether you do/don&rsquo;t
want to use it; and 4) you can extend the method to add any
customizations (or even entirely different kinds of wildcard
expansion).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">C:\&gt; copy
con c:\perl\lib\Wild.pm <br>
# Wild.pm &minus; emulate shell @ARGV expansion on shells
that don't <br>
use File::DosGlob; <br>
@ARGV = map { <br>
my @g = File::DosGlob::glob($_) if /[*?]/; <br>
@g ? @g : $_; <br>
} @ARGV; <br>
1; <br>
^Z <br>
C:\&gt; set PERL5OPT=&minus;MWild <br>
C:\&gt; perl &minus;le &quot;for (@ARGV) { print }&quot;
*/*/perl*.c <br>
p4view/perl/perl.c <br>
p4view/perl/perlio.c <br>
p4view/perl/perly.c <br>
perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c <br>
perl5.005/win32/perllib.c <br>
perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c <br>
perl5.005/win32/perllib.c <br>
perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c <br>
perl5.005/win32/perllib.c</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note there are
two distinct steps there: 1) You&rsquo;ll have to create
Wild.pm and put it in your perl lib directory. 2)
You&rsquo;ll need to set the <small>PERL5OPT</small>
environment variable. If you want argv expansion to be the
default, just set <small>PERL5OPT</small> in your default
startup environment.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
using the Visual C compiler, you can get the C
runtime&rsquo;s command line wildcard expansion built into
perl binary. The resulting binary will always expand
unquoted command lines, which may not be what you want if
you use a shell that does that for you. The expansion done
is also somewhat less powerful than the approach suggested
above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Notes on 64&minus;bit
Windows</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Windows .NET Server supports
the <small>LLP64</small> data model on the Intel Itanium
architecture.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>LLP64</small> data model is different from the
<small>LP64</small> data model that is the norm on
64&minus;bit Unix platforms. In the former, &quot;int&quot;
and &quot;long&quot; are both 32&minus;bit data types, while
pointers are 64 bits wide. In addition, there is a separate
64&minus;bit wide integral type, &quot;__int64&quot;. In
contrast, the <small>LP64</small> data model that is
pervasive on Unix platforms provides &quot;int&quot; as the
32&minus;bit type, while both the &quot;long&quot; type and
pointers are of 64&minus;bit precision. Note that both
models provide for 64&minus;bits of addressability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">64&minus;bit
Windows running on Itanium is capable of running
32&minus;bit x86 binaries transparently. This means that you
could use a 32&minus;bit build of Perl on a 64&minus;bit
system. Given this, why would one want to build a
64&minus;bit build of Perl? Here are some reasons why you
would bother:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Running Perl
Scripts</b> <br>
Perl scripts on <small>UNIX</small> use the &quot;#!&quot;
(a.k.a &quot;shebang&quot;) line to indicate to the
<small>OS</small> that it should execute the file using
perl. Windows has no comparable means to indicate arbitrary
files are executables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Instead, all
available methods to execute plain text files on Windows
rely on the file &quot;extension&quot;. There are three
methods to use this to execute perl scripts:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">There is a facility called
&quot;file extension associations&quot;. This can be
manipulated via the two commands &quot;assoc&quot; and
&quot;ftype&quot; that come standard with Windows. Type
&quot;ftype /?&quot; for a complete example of how to set
this up for perl scripts (Say what? You thought Windows
wasn&rsquo;t perl-ready? :).</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p>Since file associations don&rsquo;t work everywhere, and
there are reportedly bugs with file associations where it
does work, the old method of wrapping the perl script to
make it look like a regular batch file to the
<small>OS,</small> may be used. The install process makes
available the &quot;pl2bat.bat&quot; script which can be
used to wrap perl scripts into batch files. For example:</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">pl2bat
foo.pl</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">will create the
file &quot; <small>FOO.BAT&quot;.</small> Note
&quot;pl2bat&quot; strips any .pl suffix and adds a .bat
suffix to the generated file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">If you use the
4DOS/NT or similar command shell, note that
&quot;pl2bat&quot; uses the &quot;%*&quot; variable in the
generated batch file to refer to all the command line
arguments, so you may need to make sure that construct works
in batch files. As of this writing, 4DOS/NT users will need
a &quot;ParameterChar = *&quot; statement in their 4NT.INI
file or will need to execute &quot;setdos /p*&quot; in the
4DOS/NT startup file to enable this to work.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">3.</p></td>
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="77%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Using &quot;pl2bat&quot; has a
few problems: the file name gets changed, so scripts that
rely on $0 to find what they must do may not run properly;
running &quot;pl2bat&quot; replicates the contents of the
original script, and so this process can be maintenance
intensive if the originals get updated often. A different
approach that avoids both problems is possible.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">A script called
&quot;runperl.bat&quot; is available that can be copied to
any filename (along with the .bat suffix). For example, if
you call it &quot;foo.bat&quot;, it will run the file
&quot;foo&quot; when it is executed. Since you can run batch
files on Windows platforms simply by typing the name
(without the extension), this effectively runs the file
&quot;foo&quot;, when you type either &quot;foo&quot; or
&quot;foo.bat&quot;. With this method, &quot;foo.bat&quot;
can even be in a different location than the file
&quot;foo&quot;, as long as &quot;foo&quot; is available
somewhere on the <small>PATH.</small> If your scripts are on
a filesystem that allows symbolic links, you can even avoid
copying &quot;runperl.bat&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">Here&rsquo;s a
diversion: copy &quot;runperl.bat&quot; to
&quot;runperl&quot;, and type &quot;runperl&quot;. Explain
the observed behavior, or lack thereof. :) Hint: .gnidnats

A full set of <small>HTML</small> documentation is

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;perldoc&quot;
is also a useful tool for browsing information contained in
the documentation, especially in conjunction with a pager
like &quot;less&quot; (recent versions of which have Windows
support). You may have to set the <small>PAGER</small>
environment variable to use a specific pager. &quot;perldoc
&minus;f foo&quot; will print information about the perl
operator &quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One common
mistake when using this port with a <small>GUI</small>
library like &quot;Tk&quot; is assuming that Perl&rsquo;s
normal behavior of opening a command-line window will go
away. This isn&rsquo;t the case. If you want to start a copy
of &quot;perl&quot; without opening a command-line window,
use the &quot;wperl&quot; executable built during the
installation process. Usage is exactly the same as normal
&quot;perl&quot; on Windows, except that options like
&quot;&minus;h&quot; don&rsquo;t work (since they need a
command-line window to print to).</p>

<h2>BUGS AND CAVEATS
<a name="BUGS AND CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Norton
AntiVirus interferes with the build process, particularly if
set to &quot;AutoProtect, All Files, when Opened&quot;.
Unlike large applications the perl build process opens and
modifies a lot of files. Having the AntiVirus scan each and
every one slows build the process significantly. Worse, with
PERLIO=stdio the build process fails with peculiar messages
as the virus checker interacts badly with miniperl.exe
writing configure files (it seems to either catch file part
written and treat it as suspicious, or virus checker may
have it &quot;locked&quot; in a way which inhibits miniperl
updating it). The build does complete with</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">set
PERLIO=perlio</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">but that may be
just luck. Other AntiVirus software may have similar
issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A git
<small>GUI</small> shell extension for Windows such as
TortoiseGit will cause the build and later &quot;make
test&quot; to run much slower since every file is checked
for its git status as soon as it is created and/or modified.
TortoiseGit doesn&rsquo;t cause any test failures or build
problems unlike the antivirus software described above, but
it does cause similar slowness. It is suggested to use Task
Manager to look for background processes which use high
<small>CPU</small> amounts during the building process.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some of the
built-in functions do not act exactly as documented in
perlfunc, and a few are not implemented at all. To avoid
surprises, particularly if you have had prior exposure to
Perl in other operating environments or if you intend to
write code that will be portable to other environments, see
perlport for a reasonably definitive list of these
differences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Not all
extensions available from <small>CPAN</small> may build or
work properly in the Windows environment. See &quot;Building
Extensions&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most
&quot;socket()&quot; related calls are supported, but they
may not behave as on Unix platforms. See perlport for the
full list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Signal handling
may not behave as on Unix platforms (where it doesn&rsquo;t
exactly &quot;behave&quot;, either :). For instance, calling
&quot;die()&quot; or &quot;exit()&quot; from signal handlers
will cause an exception, since most implementations of
&quot;signal()&quot; on Windows are severely crippled. Thus,
signals may work only for simple things like setting a flag
variable in the handler. Using signals under this port
should currently be considered unsupported.</p>
