<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document

<h2>About the new versioning system
<a name="About the new versioning system"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl is now
developed on two tracks: a maintenance track that makes
small, safe updates to released production versions with
emphasis on compatibility; and a development track that
pursues more aggressive evolution. Maintenance releases
(which should be considered production quality) have
subversion numbers that run from 1 to 49, and development
releases (which should be considered &quot;alpha&quot;
quality) run from 50 to 99.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl 5.005 is
the combined product of the new dual-track development
scheme.</p>

<h2>Incompatible Changes
<a name="Incompatible Changes"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>WARNING:</small>
This version is not binary compatible with Perl 5.004.</b>
<br>
Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and
far-reaching changes to the language internals. If you have
dynamically loaded extensions that you built under perl
5.003 or 5.004, you can continue to use them with 5.004, but
you will need to rebuild and reinstall those extensions to
use them 5.005. See <i><small>INSTALL</small></i> for
detailed instructions on how to upgrade.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Default
installation structure has changed</b> <br>
The new Configure defaults are designed to allow a smooth
upgrade from 5.004 to 5.005, but you should read
<i><small>INSTALL</small></i> for a detailed discussion of
the changes in order to adapt them to your system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl Source
Compatibility</b> <br>
When none of the experimental features are enabled, there
should be very few user-visible Perl source compatibility
issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If threads are
enabled, then some caveats apply. @_ and $_ become lexical
variables. The effect of this should be largely transparent
to the user, but there are some boundary conditions under
which user will need to be aware of the issues. For example,
&quot;local(@_)&quot; results in a &quot;Can&rsquo;t
localize lexical variable @_ ...&quot; message. This may be
enabled in a future version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some new
keywords have been introduced. These are generally expected
to have very little impact on compatibility. See &quot;New
&quot;INIT&quot; keyword&quot;, &quot;New &quot;lock&quot;
keyword&quot;, and &quot;New &quot;qr//&quot;
operator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Certain
barewords are now reserved. Use of these will provoke a
warning if you have asked for them with the
&quot;&minus;w&quot; switch. See &quot;&quot;our&quot; is
now a reserved word&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>C Source
Compatibility</b> <br>
There have been a large number of changes in the internals
to support the new features in this release.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">All Perl global
variables that are visible for use by extensions now have a
&quot;PL_&quot; prefix. New extensions should
&quot;not&quot; refer to perl globals by their unqualified
names. To preserve sanity, we provide limited backward
compatibility for globals that are being widely used like
&quot;sv_undef&quot; and &quot;na&quot; (which should now be
written as &quot;PL_sv_undef&quot;, &quot;PL_na&quot;
etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you find
that your <small>XS</small> extension does not compile
anymore because a perl global is not visible, try adding a
&quot;PL_&quot; prefix to the global and rebuild.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is strongly
recommended that all functions in the Perl
<small>API</small> that don&rsquo;t begin with
&quot;perl&quot; be referenced with a &quot;Perl_&quot;
prefix. The bare function names without the
&quot;Perl_&quot; prefix are supported with macros, but this
support may cease in a future release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
perlapi.</p>

</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl built with
threading enabled requires extensions to use the new
&quot;dTHR&quot; macro to initialize the handle to access
per-thread data. If you see a compiler error that talks
about the variable &quot;thr&quot; not being declared (when
building a module that has <small>XS</small> code), you need
to add &quot;dTHR;&quot; at the beginning of the block that
elicited the error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<small>API</small> function
&quot;perl_get_sv(&quot;@&quot;,GV_ADD)&quot; should be used
instead of directly accessing perl globals as
&quot;GvSV(errgv)&quot;. The <small>API</small> call is
backward compatible with existing perls and provides source
compatibility with threading is enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See &quot;C
Source Compatibility&quot; for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Binary
Compatibility</b> <br>
This version is <small>NOT</small> binary compatible with
older versions. All extensions will need to be recompiled.
Further binaries built with threads enabled are incompatible
with binaries built without. This should largely be
transparent to the user, as all binary incompatible
configurations have their own unique architecture name, and
extension binaries get installed at unique locations. This
allows coexistence of several configurations in the same
directory hierarchy. See <i><small>INSTALL</small></i> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Security
fixes may affect compatibility</b> <br>
A few taint leaks and taint omissions have been corrected.
This may lead to &quot;failure&quot; of scripts that used to
work with older versions. Compiling with
&minus;DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS provides a perl with minimal
amounts of changes to the tainting behavior. But note that
the resulting perl will have known insecurities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Oneliners with
the &quot;&minus;e&quot; switch do not create temporary
files anymore.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Relaxed new
mandatory warnings introduced in 5.004</b> <br>
Many new warnings that were introduced in 5.004 have been
made optional. Some of these warnings are still present, but
perl&rsquo;s new features make them less often a problem.
See &quot;New Diagnostics&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Licensing</b>
<br>
Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors. See
<i>Porting/Contract</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The license
included in much of the Perl documentation has changed. Most
of the Perl documentation was previously under the implicit
<small>GNU</small> General Public License or the Artistic
License (at the user&rsquo;s choice). Now much of the
documentation unambiguously states the terms under which it
may be distributed. Those terms are in general much less
restrictive than the <small>GNU GPL.</small> See perl and
the individual perl manpages listed therein.</p>

<h2>Core Changes
<a name="Core Changes"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Threads</b>
<small><br>
WARNING:</small> Threading is considered an
<b>experimental</b> feature. Details of the implementation
may change without notice. There are known limitations and
some bugs. These are expected to be fixed in future
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
<i><small>README</small> .threads</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compiler</b>
<small><br>
WARNING:</small> The Compiler and related tools are
considered <b>experimental</b>. Features may change without
notice, and there are known limitations and bugs. Since the
compiler is fully external to perl, the default
configuration will build and install it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Compiler
produces three different types of transformations of a perl
program. The C backend generates C code that captures
perl&rsquo;s state just before execution begins. It
eliminates the compile-time overheads of the regular perl
interpreter, but the run-time performance remains
comparatively the same. The <small>CC</small> backend
generates optimized C code equivalent to the code path at
run-time. The <small>CC</small> backend has greater
potential for big optimizations, but only a few
optimizations are implemented currently. The Bytecode
backend generates a platform independent bytecode
representation of the interpreter&rsquo;s state just before
execution. Thus, the Bytecode back end also eliminates much
of the compilation overhead of the interpreter.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The compiler
comes with several valuable utilities.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;B::Lint&quot;
is an experimental module to detect and warn about
suspicious code, especially the cases that the
&quot;&minus;w&quot; switch does not detect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;B::Deparse&quot;
can be used to demystify perl code, and understand how perl
optimizes certain constructs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;B::Xref&quot;
generates cross reference reports of all definition and use
of variables, subroutines and formats in a program.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;B::Showlex&quot;
show the lexical variables used by a subroutine or file at a
glance.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;perlcc&quot;
is a simple frontend for compiling perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;ext/B/README&quot;, B, and the respective compiler
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Regular
Expressions</b> <br>
Perl&rsquo;s regular expression engine has been seriously
overhauled, and many new constructs are supported. Several
bugs have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
itemized summary: <br>
Many new and improved optimizations</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Changes in the
<small>RE</small> engine:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unneeded nodes
removed; <br>
Substrings merged together; <br>
New types of nodes to process (SUBEXPR)* and similar
expressions <br>
quickly, used if the SUBEXPR has no side effects and matches
<br>
strings of the same length; <br>
Better optimizations by lookup for constant substrings; <br>
Better search for constants substrings anchored by $ ;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Changes in Perl
code using <small>RE</small> engine:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">More
optimizations to s/longer/short/; <br>
study() was not working; <br>
/blah/ may be optimized to an analogue of index() if $&amp;
$` $' not seen; <br>
Unneeded copying of matched&minus;against string removed;
<br>
Only matched part of the string is copying if $` $' were not
seen;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Many bug fixes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Note that only the major bug
fixes are listed here. See <i>Changes</i> for others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Backtracking
might not restore start of $3. <br>
No feedback if max count for * or + on &quot;complex&quot;
subexpression <br>
was reached, similarly (but at compile time) for {3,34567}
<br>
Primitive restrictions on max count introduced to decrease a
<br>
possibility of a segfault; <br>
(ZERO&minus;LENGTH)* could segfault; <br>
(ZERO&minus;LENGTH)* was prohibited; <br>
Long REs were not allowed; <br>
/RE/g could skip matches at the same position after a <br>
zero&minus;length match;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">New regular expression
constructs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The following new syntax
elements are supported:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">(?&lt;=RE) <br>
(?&lt;!RE) <br>
(?{ CODE }) <br>
(?i&minus;x) <br>
(?i:RE) <br>
(?(COND)YES_RE|NO_RE) <br>
(?&gt;RE) <br>
\z</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">New operator for precompiled
regular expressions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See &quot;New &quot;qr//&quot;
operator&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Other improvements</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Better debugging output
(possibly with colors), <br>
even from non&minus;debugging Perl; <br>
RE engine code now looks like C, not like assembler; <br>
Behaviour of RE modifiable by `use re' directive; <br>
Improved documentation; <br>
Test suite significantly extended; <br>
Syntax [:^upper:] etc., reserved inside character
classes;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Incompatible changes</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(?i) localized inside enclosing
group; <br>
$( is not interpolated into RE any more; <br>
/RE/g may match at the same position (with non&minus;zero
length) <br>
after a zero&minus;length match (bug fix).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See perlre and
perlop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Improved
malloc()</b> <br>
See banner at the beginning of &quot;malloc.c&quot; for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Quicksort is
internally implemented</b> <br>
Perl now contains its own highly optimized <b>qsort()</b>
routine. The new <b>qsort()</b> is resistant to inconsistent
comparison functions, so Perl&rsquo;s &quot;sort()&quot;
will not provoke coredumps any more when given poorly
written sort subroutines. (Some C library
&quot;qsort()&quot;s that were being used before used to
have this problem.) In our testing, the new
&quot;qsort()&quot; required the minimal number of pair-wise
compares on average, among all known &quot;qsort()&quot;
implementations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;perlfunc/sort&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Reliable
signals</b> <br>
Perl&rsquo;s signal handling is susceptible to random
crashes, because signals arrive asynchronously, and the Perl
runtime is not reentrant at arbitrary times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, one
experimental implementation of reliable signals is available
when threads are enabled. See &quot;Thread::Signal&quot;.
Also see <i><small>INSTALL</small></i> for how to build a
Perl capable of threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Reliable
stack pointers</b> <br>
The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at
predictable times. In particular, magic calls never trigger
reallocations of the stack, because all reentrancy of the
runtime is handled using a &quot;stack of stacks&quot;. This
should improve reliability of cached stack pointers in the
internals and in XSUBs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>More
generous treatment of carriage returns</b> <br>
Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage
returns in scripts. Now they are mostly treated like
whitespace within program text. Inside string literals and
here documents, literal carriage returns are ignored if they
occur paired with linefeeds, or get interpreted as
whitespace if they stand alone. This behavior means that
literal carriage returns in files should be avoided. You can
get the older, more compatible (but less generous) behavior
by defining the preprocessor symbol
&quot;PERL_STRICT_CR&quot; when building perl. Of course,
all this has nothing whatever to do with how escapes like
&quot;\r&quot; are handled within strings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
doesn&rsquo;t somehow magically allow you to keep all text
files in <small>DOS</small> format. The generous treatment
only applies to files that perl itself parses. If your C
compiler doesn&rsquo;t allow carriage returns in files, you
may still be unable to build modules that need a C
compiler.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Memory
leaks</b> <br>
&quot;substr&quot;, &quot;pos&quot; and &quot;vec&quot;
don&rsquo;t leak memory anymore when used in lvalue context.
Many small leaks that impacted applications that embed
multiple interpreters have been fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Better
support for multiple interpreters</b> <br>
The build-time option &quot;&minus;DMULTIPLICITY&quot; has
had many of the details reworked. Some previously global
variables that should have been per-interpreter now are.
With care, this allows interpreters to call each other. See
the &quot;PerlInterp&quot; extension on
<small>CPAN.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Behavior of
local() on array and hash elements is now well-defined</b>
<br>
See &quot;Temporary Values via <b>local()</b>&quot; in
perlsub.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;%!&quot;
is transparently tied to the Errno module</b> <br>
See perlvar, and Errno.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pseudo-hashes
are supported</b> <br>
See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;EXPR
foreach EXPR&quot; is supported</b> <br>
See perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Keywords can
be globally overridden</b> <br>
See perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$^E is
meaningful on Win32</b> <br>
See perlvar.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;foreach
(1..1000000)&quot; optimized</b> <br>
&quot;foreach (1..1000000)&quot; is now optimized into a
counting loop. It does not try to allocate a
1000000&minus;size list anymore.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;Foo::&quot;
can be used as implicitly quoted package name</b> <br>
Barewords caused unintuitive behavior when a subroutine with
the same name as a package happened to be defined. Thus,
&quot;new Foo @args&quot;, use the result of the call to
&quot;Foo()&quot; instead of &quot;Foo&quot; being treated
as a literal. The recommended way to write barewords in the
indirect object slot is &quot;new Foo:: @args&quot;. Note
that the method &quot;new()&quot; is called with a first
argument of &quot;Foo&quot;, not &quot;Foo::&quot; when you
do that.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;exists
$Foo::{Bar::}&quot; tests existence of a package</b> <br>
It was impossible to test for the existence of a package
without actually creating it before. Now &quot;exists
$Foo::{Bar::}&quot; can be used to test if the
&quot;Foo::Bar&quot; namespace has been created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Better
locale support</b> <br>
See perllocale.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Experimental
support for 64&minus;bit platforms</b> <br>
Perl5 has always had 64&minus;bit support on systems with
64&minus;bit longs. Starting with 5.005, the beginnings of
experimental support for systems with 32&minus;bit long and
64&minus;bit &rsquo;long long&rsquo; integers has been
added. If you add &minus;DUSE_LONG_LONG to your ccflags in
config.sh (or manually define it in perl.h) then perl will
be built with &rsquo;long long&rsquo; support. There will be
many compiler warnings, and the resultant perl may not work
on all systems. There are many other issues related to
third-party extensions and libraries. This option exists to
allow people to work on those issues.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>prototype()
returns useful results on builtins</b> <br>
See &quot;prototype&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Extended
support for exception handling</b> <br>
&quot;die()&quot; now accepts a reference value, and $@ gets
set to that value in exception traps. This makes it possible
to propagate exception objects. This is an undocumented
<b>experimental</b> feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Re-blessing
in <small>DESTROY</small> () supported for chaining
<small>DESTROY</small> () methods</b> <br>
See &quot;Destructors&quot; in perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>All
&quot;printf&quot; format conversions are handled
internally</b> <br>
See &quot;printf&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New
&quot;INIT&quot; keyword</b> <br>
&quot;INIT&quot; subs are like &quot;BEGIN&quot; and
&quot;END&quot;, but they get run just before the perl
runtime begins execution. e.g., the Perl Compiler makes use
of &quot;INIT&quot; blocks to initialize and resolve
pointers to XSUBs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New
&quot;lock&quot; keyword</b> <br>
The &quot;lock&quot; keyword is the fundamental
synchronization primitive in threaded perl. When threads are
not enabled, it is currently a noop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To minimize
impact on source compatibility this keyword is
&quot;weak&quot;, i.e., any user-defined subroutine of the
same name overrides it, unless a &quot;use Thread&quot; has
been seen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New
&quot;qr//&quot; operator</b> <br>
The &quot;qr//&quot; operator, which is syntactically
similar to the other quote-like operators, is used to create
precompiled regular expressions. This compiled form can now
be explicitly passed around in variables, and interpolated
in other regular expressions. See perlop.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;our&quot;
is now a reserved word</b> <br>
Calling a subroutine with the name &quot;our&quot; will now
provoke a warning when using the &quot;&minus;w&quot;
switch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tied arrays
are now fully supported</b> <br>
See Tie::Array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tied handles
support is better</b> <br>
Several missing hooks have been added. There is also a new
base class for <small>TIEARRAY</small> implementations. See
Tie::Array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>4th argument
to substr <br>
substr()</b> can now both return and replace in one
operation. The optional 4th argument is the replacement
string. See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Negative
<small>LENGTH</small> argument to splice <br>
splice()</b> with a negative <small>LENGTH</small> argument
now work similar to what the <small>LENGTH</small> did for
<b>substr()</b>. Previously a negative <small>LENGTH</small>
was treated as 0. See &quot;splice&quot; in perlfunc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Magic
lvalues are now more magical</b> <br>
When you say something like &quot;substr($x, 5) =
&quot;hi&quot;&quot;, the scalar returned by <b>substr()</b>
is special, in that any modifications to it affect $x. (This
is called a &rsquo;magic lvalue&rsquo; because an
&rsquo;lvalue&rsquo; is something on the left side of an
assignment.) Normally, this is exactly what you would expect
to happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you use
<b>substr()</b>, <b>pos()</b>, or <b>vec()</b> in a context
where they might be modified, like taking a reference with
&quot;\&quot; or as an argument to a sub that modifies @_.
In previous versions, this &rsquo;magic&rsquo; only went one
way, but now changes to the scalar the magic refers to ($x
in the above example) affect the magic lvalue too. For
instance, this code now acts differently:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$x =
&quot;hello&quot;; <br>
sub printit { <br>
$x = &quot;g'bye&quot;; <br>
print $_[0], &quot;\n&quot;; <br>
} <br>
printit(substr($x, 0, 5));</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In previous
versions, this would print &quot;hello&quot;, but it now
prints &quot;g&rsquo;bye&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&lt;&gt; now
reads in records</b> <br>
If $/ is a reference to an integer, or a scalar that holds
an integer, &lt;&gt; will read in records instead of lines.
For more info, see &quot;$/&quot; in perlvar.</p>

<h2>New Diagnostics
<a name="New Diagnostics"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ambiguous call
resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) A subroutine you have
declared has the same name as a Perl keyword, and you have
used the name without qualification for calling one or the
other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the
subroutine is not imported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To force
interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an ampersand
before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its
package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or
pretend that it&rsquo;s imported with the &quot;use
subs&quot; pragma).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To silently
interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
&quot;CORE::&quot; prefix on the operator (e.g.
&quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;) or by declaring the subroutine to
be an object method (see &quot;attrs&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bad index while coercing array
into hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The index looked up in the
hash found as the 0&rsquo;th element of a pseudo-hash is not
legal. Index values must be at 1 or greater. See
perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers
to nonexistent package</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You used a qualified
bareword of the form &quot;Foo::&quot;, but the compiler saw
no other uses of that namespace before that point. Perhaps
you need to predeclare a package?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t call method
&quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used the syntax of a
method call, but the slot filled by the object reference or
package name contains an undefined value. Something like
this will reproduce the error:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$BADREF = 42;
<br>
process $BADREF 1,2,3; <br>
$BADREF&minus;&gt;process(1,2,3);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t check filesystem of
script &quot;%s&quot; for nosuid</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(P) For some reason you
can&rsquo;t check the filesystem of the script for
nosuid.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t coerce array into
hash</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You used an array where a
hash was expected, but the array has no information on how
to map from keys to array indices. You can do that only with
arrays that have a hash reference at index 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t goto subroutine
from an eval-string</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The &quot;goto
subroutine&quot; call can&rsquo;t be used to jump out of an
eval &quot;string&quot;. (You can use it to jump out of an
eval { <small>BLOCK</small> }, but you probably don&rsquo;t
want to.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t localize
pseudo-hash element</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You said something like
&quot;local $ar&minus;&gt;{'key'}&quot;, where $ar is a
reference to a pseudo-hash. That hasn&rsquo;t been
implemented yet, but you can get a similar effect by
localizing the corresponding array element directly:
&quot;local
$ar&minus;&gt;[$ar&minus;&gt;[0]{'key'}]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Can&rsquo;t use %%! because
Errno.pm is not available</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The first time the %! hash
is used, perl automatically loads the Errno.pm module. The
Errno module is expected to tie the %! hash to provide
symbolic names for $! errno values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Cannot find an opnumber for
&quot;%s&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A string of a form
&quot;CORE::word&quot; was given to <b>prototype()</b>, but
there is no builtin with the name &quot;word&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character class syntax [. .] is
reserved for future extensions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) Within regular expression
character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with
&quot;[.&quot; and ending with &quot;.]&quot; is reserved
for future extensions. If you need to represent those
character sequences inside a regular expression character
class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
&quot;\[.&quot; and &quot;.\]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character class syntax [: :] is
reserved for future extensions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) Within regular expression
character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with
&quot;[:&quot; and ending with &quot;:]&quot; is reserved
for future extensions. If you need to represent those
character sequences inside a regular expression character
class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
&quot;\[:&quot; and &quot;:\]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Character class syntax [= =] is
reserved for future extensions</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) Within regular expression
character classes ([]) the syntax beginning with
&quot;[=&quot; and ending with &quot;=]&quot; is reserved
for future extensions. If you need to represent those
character sequences inside a regular expression character
class, just quote the square brackets with the backslash:
&quot;\[=&quot; and &quot;=\]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: Eval-group in insecure
regular expression</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl detected tainted data
when trying to compile a regular expression that contains
the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion, which is
unsafe. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre, and
perlsec.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: Eval-group not allowed, use
re &rsquo;eval&rsquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) A regular expression
contained the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot; zero-width assertion,
but that construct is only allowed when the &quot;use re
'eval'&quot; pragma is in effect. See &quot;(?{ code
})&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">%s: Eval-group not allowed at
run time</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) Perl tried to compile a
regular expression containing the &quot;(?{ ... })&quot;
zero-width assertion at run time, as it would when the
pattern contains interpolated values. Since that is a
security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may
still do this by explicitly building the pattern from an
interpolated string at run time and using that in an
<b>eval()</b>. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Explicit blessing to
&rsquo;&rsquo; (assuming package main)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You are blessing a
reference to a zero length string. This has the effect of
blessing the reference into the package main. This is
usually not what you want. Consider providing a default
target package, e.g. bless($ref, $p ||
&rsquo;MyPackage&rsquo;);</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Illegal hex digit ignored</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You may have tried to use a
character other than 0 &minus; 9 or A &minus; F in a
hexadecimal number. Interpretation of the hexadecimal number
stopped before the illegal character.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such array field</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to access an
array as a hash, but the field name used is not defined. The
hash at index 0 should map all valid field names to array
indices for that to work.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">No such field &quot;%s&quot; in
variable %s of type %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You tried to access a field
of a typed variable where the type does not know about the
field name. The field names are looked up in the %FIELDS
hash in the type package at compile time. The %FIELDS hash
is usually set up with the &rsquo;fields&rsquo; pragma.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Out of memory during
ridiculously large request</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) You can&rsquo;t allocate
more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes. This error is
most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program.
e.g., $arr[time] instead of $arr[$time].</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Range iterator outside integer
range</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) One (or both) of the
numeric arguments to the range operator &quot;..&quot; are
outside the range which can be represented by integers
internally. One possible workaround is to force Perl to use
magical string increment by prepending &quot;0&quot; to your
numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Recursive inheritance detected
while looking for method &rsquo;%s&rsquo; %s</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) More than 100 levels of
inheritance were encountered while invoking a method.
Probably indicates an unintended loop in your inheritance
hierarchy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Reference found where
even-sized list expected</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) You gave a single reference
where Perl was expecting a list with an even number of
elements (for assignment to a hash). This usually means that
you used the anon hash constructor when you meant to use
parens. In any case, a hash requires key/value
<b>pairs</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">%hash = { one
=&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, }; # WRONG <br>
%hash = [ qw/ an anon array / ]; # WRONG <br>
%hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, ); # right <br>
%hash = qw( one 1 two 2 ); # also fine</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Undefined value assigned to
typeglob</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(W) An undefined value was
assigned to a typeglob, a la &quot;*foo = undef&quot;. This
does nothing. It&rsquo;s possible that you really mean
&quot;undef *foo&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Use of reserved word
&quot;%s&quot; is deprecated</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(D) The indicated bareword is a
reserved word. Future versions of perl may use it as a
keyword, so you&rsquo;re better off either explicitly
quoting the word in a manner appropriate for its context of
use, or using a different name altogether. The warning can
be suppressed for subroutine names by either adding a
&quot;&amp;&quot; prefix, or using a package qualifier, e.g.
&quot;&amp;our()&quot;, or &quot;Foo::our()&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">perl: warning: Setting locale
failed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(S) The whole warning message
will look something like:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">perl: warning:
Setting locale failed. <br>
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings: <br>
LC_ALL = &quot;En_US&quot;, <br>
LANG = (unset) <br>
are supported and installed on your system. <br>
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale
(&quot;C&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Exactly what
were the failed locale settings varies. In the above the
settings were that the <small>LC_ALL</small> was
&quot;En_US&quot; and the <small>LANG</small> had no value.
This error means that Perl detected that you and/or your
system administrator have set up the so-called variable
system but Perl could not use those settings. This was not
dead serious, fortunately: there is a &quot;default
locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot; that Perl can and will
use, the script will be run. Before you really fix the
problem, however, you will get the same error message each
time you run Perl. How to really fix the problem can be
found in &quot; <small>LOCALE PROBLEMS&quot;</small> in
perllocale.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">regexp too big</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">(F) The current implementation
of regular expressions uses shorts as address offsets within
a string. Unfortunately this means that if the regular
expression compiles to longer than 32767, it&rsquo;ll blow
up. Usually when you want a regular expression this big,
there is a better way to do it with multiple statements. See
perlre.</p>

<h2>Configuration Changes
<a name="Configuration Changes"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use
&quot;Configure &minus;Uinstallusrbinperl&quot; which causes
installperl to skip installing perl also as /usr/bin/perl.
This is useful if you prefer not to modify /usr/bin for some
