&minus; Receive what is pushed into the repository</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git
receive&minus;pack</i> &lt;git&minus;dir&gt;</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Invoked by
<i>git send&minus;pack</i> and updates the repository with
the information fed from the remote end.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This command is
usually not invoked directly by the end user. The UI for the
protocol is on the <i>git send&minus;pack</i> side, and the
program pair is meant to be used to push updates to remote
repository. For pull operations, see
<b>git-fetch-pack</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The command
allows for creation and fast&minus;forwarding of sha1 refs
(heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the
local end <i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i> runs, but to
the user who is sitting at the send&minus;pack end, it is
updating the remote. Confused?)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are other
real&minus;world examples of using update and
post&minus;update hooks found in the Documentation/howto
directory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>
honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards config option, which
tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if they are
not fast&minus;forwards.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A number of
other receive.* config options are available to tweak its
behavior, see <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;git&minus;dir&gt;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The repository to sync
into.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&minus;&minus;http&minus;backend&minus;info&minus;refs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Used by
<b>git-http-backend</b>(1) to serve up
<b>$GIT_URL/info/refs?service=git&minus;receive&minus;pack</b>
requests. See
<b>&minus;&minus;http&minus;backend&minus;info&minus;refs</b>
in <b>git-upload-pack</b>(1).</p>

<h2>PRE&minus;RECEIVE HOOK
<a name="PRE&minus;RECEIVE HOOK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before any ref
is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/pre&minus;receive file exists
and is executable, it will be invoked once with no
parameters. The standard input of the hook will be one line
per ref to be updated:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sha1&minus;old
SP sha1&minus;new SP refname LF</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The refname
value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this
is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before
each refname are the object names for the refname before and
after the update. Refs to be created will have
sha1&minus;old equal to 0{40}, while refs to be deleted will
have sha1&minus;new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1&minus;old
and sha1&minus;new should be valid objects in the
repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When accepting
a signed push (see <b>git-push</b>(1)), the signed push
certificate is stored in a blob and an environment variable
<b>GIT_PUSH_CERT</b> can be consulted for its object name.
See the description of <b>post&minus;receive</b> hook for an
example. In addition, the certificate is verified using GPG
and the result is exported with the following environment
variables:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name and the e&minus;mail
address of the owner of the key that signed the push
certificate.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_KEY</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The GPG key ID of the key that
signed the push certificate.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The status of GPG verification
of the push certificate, using the same mnemonic as used in
<b>%G?</b> format of <b>git log</b> family of commands (see
<b>git-log</b>(1)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The nonce string the process
asked the signer to include in the push certificate. If this
does not match the value recorded on the &quot;nonce&quot;
header in the push certificate, it may indicate that the
certificate is a valid one that is being replayed from a
separate &quot;git push&quot; session.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>UNSOLICITED</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">&quot;git push
&minus;&minus;signed&quot; sent a nonce when we did not ask
it to send one.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>MISSING</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">&quot;git push
&minus;&minus;signed&quot; did not send any nonce
header.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>BAD</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">&quot;git push
&minus;&minus;signed&quot; sent a bogus nonce.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>OK</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">&quot;git push
&minus;&minus;signed&quot; sent the nonce we asked it to
send.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SLOP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:23%;">&quot;git push
&minus;&minus;signed&quot; sent a nonce different from what
we asked it to send now, but in a previous session. See
<b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP</b> environment variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;git push
&minus;&minus;signed&quot; sent a nonce different from what
we asked it to send now, but in a different session whose
starting time is different by this many seconds from the
current session. Only meaningful when
<b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS</b> says <b>SLOP</b>. Also
read about <b>receive.certNonceSlop</b> variable in
<b>git-config</b>(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook is
called before any refname is updated and before any
fast&minus;forward checks are performed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
pre&minus;receive hook exits with a non&minus;zero exit
status no updates will be performed, and the update,
post&minus;receive and post&minus;update hooks will not be
invoked either. This can be useful to quickly bail out if
the update is not to be supported.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See the notes
on the quarantine environment below.</p>

<h2>UPDATE HOOK
<a name="UPDATE HOOK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Before each ref
is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/update file exists and is
executable, it is invoked once per ref, with three
parameters:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$GIT_DIR/hooks/update
refname sha1&minus;old sha1&minus;new</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The refname
parameter is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head
this is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1
arguments are the object names for the refname before and
after the update. Note that the hook is called before the
refname is updated, so either sha1&minus;old is 0{40}
(meaning there is no such ref yet), or it should match what
is recorded in refname.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The hook should
exit with non&minus;zero status if it wants to disallow
updating the named ref. Otherwise it should exit with
zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Successful
execution (a zero exit status) of this hook does not ensure
the ref will actually be updated, it is only a prerequisite.
As such it is not a good idea to send notices (e.g. email)
from this hook. Consider using the post&minus;receive hook
instead.</p>

<h2>POST&minus;RECEIVE HOOK
<a name="POST&minus;RECEIVE HOOK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After all refs
were updated (or attempted to be updated), if any ref update
was successful, and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post&minus;receive
file exists and is executable, it will be invoked once with
no parameters. The standard input of the hook will be one
line for each successfully updated ref:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sha1&minus;old
SP sha1&minus;new SP refname LF</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The refname
value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master head this
is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before
each refname are the object names for the refname before and
after the update. Refs that were created will have
sha1&minus;old equal to 0{40}, while refs that were deleted
will have sha1&minus;new equal to 0{40}, otherwise
sha1&minus;old and sha1&minus;new should be valid objects in
the repository.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>GIT_PUSH_CERT*</b> environment variables can be
inspected, just as in <b>pre&minus;receive</b> hook, after
accepting a signed push.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using this
hook, it is easy to generate mails describing the updates to
the repository. This example script sends one mail message
per ref listing the commits pushed to the repository, and
logs the push certificates of signed pushes with good
signatures to a logger service:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
# mail out commit update information. <br>
while read oval nval ref <br>
do <br>
if expr &quot;$oval&quot; : '0*$' &gt;/dev/null <br>
then <br>
echo &quot;Created a new ref, with the following
commits:&quot; <br>
git rev&minus;list &minus;&minus;pretty &quot;$nval&quot;
<br>
else <br>
echo &quot;New commits:&quot; <br>
git rev&minus;list &minus;&minus;pretty &quot;$nval&quot;
&quot;^$oval&quot; <br>
fi | <br>
mail &minus;s &quot;Changes to ref $ref&quot;
commit&minus;list@mydomain <br>
done <br>
# log signed push certificate, if any <br>
if test &minus;n &quot;${GIT_PUSH_CERT&minus;}&quot;
&amp;&amp; test ${GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS} = G <br>
then <br>
( <br>
echo expected nonce is ${GIT_PUSH_NONCE} <br>
git cat&minus;file blob ${GIT_PUSH_CERT} <br>
) | mail &minus;s &quot;push certificate from
$GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER&quot; push&minus;log@mydomain <br>
fi <br>
exit 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit code
from this hook invocation is ignored, however a
non&minus;zero exit code will generate an error message.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that it is
possible for refname to not have sha1&minus;new when this
hook runs. This can easily occur if another user modifies
the ref after it was updated by
<i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i>, but before the hook was
able to evaluate it. It is recommended that hooks rely on
sha1&minus;new rather than the current value of refname.</p>

<h2>POST&minus;UPDATE HOOK
<a name="POST&minus;UPDATE HOOK"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After all other
processing, if at least one ref was updated, and if
$GIT_DIR/hooks/post&minus;update file exists and is
executable, then post&minus;update will be called with the
list of refs that have been updated. This can be used to
implement any repository wide cleanup tasks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit code
from this hook invocation is ignored; the only thing left
for <i>git&minus;receive&minus;pack</i> to do at that point
is to exit itself anyway.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This hook can
be used, for example, to run <b>git
update&minus;server&minus;info</b> if the repository is
packed and is served via a dumb transport.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">#!/bin/sh <br>
exec git update&minus;server&minus;info</p>

<h2>QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT
<a name="QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When
<b>receive&minus;pack</b> takes in objects, they are placed
into a temporary &quot;quarantine&quot; directory within the
<b>$GIT_DIR/objects</b> directory and migrated into the main
object store only after the <b>pre&minus;receive</b> hook
has completed. If the push fails before then, the temporary
directory is removed entirely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This has a few
user&minus;visible effects and caveats:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. Pushes which
fail due to problems with the incoming pack, missing
objects, or due to the <b>pre&minus;receive</b> hook will
not leave any on&minus;disk data. This is usually helpful to
prevent repeated failed pushes from filling up your disk,
but can make debugging more challenging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. Any objects
created by the <b>pre&minus;receive</b> hook will be created
in the quarantine directory (and migrated only if it
succeeds).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. The
<b>pre&minus;receive</b> hook MUST NOT update any refs to
point to quarantined objects. Other programs accessing the
repository will not be able to see the objects (and if the
pre&minus;receive hook fails, those refs would become
corrupted). For safety, any ref updates from within
<b>pre&minus;receive</b> are automatically rejected.</p>
