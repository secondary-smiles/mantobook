module.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Packages</b>
<br>
Unlike Perl 4, in which all the variables were dynamic and
shared one global name space, causing maintainability
problems, Perl 5 provides two mechanisms for protecting code
from having its variables stomped on by other code:
lexically scoped variables created with &quot;my&quot; or
&quot;state&quot; and namespaced global variables, which are
exposed via the &quot;vars&quot; pragma, or the
&quot;our&quot; keyword. Any global variable is considered
to be part of a namespace and can be accessed via a
&quot;fully qualified form&quot;. Conversely, any lexically
scoped variable is considered to be part of that
lexical-scope, and does not have a &quot;fully qualified
form&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In perl
namespaces are called &quot;packages&quot; and the
&quot;package&quot; declaration tells the compiler which
namespace to prefix to &quot;our&quot; variables and
unqualified dynamic names. This both protects against
accidental stomping and provides an interface for
deliberately clobbering global dynamic variables declared
and used in other scopes or packages, when that is what you
want to do.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The scope of
the &quot;package&quot; declaration is from the declaration
itself through the end of the enclosing block,
&quot;eval&quot;, or file, whichever comes first (the same
scope as the <b>my()</b>, <b>our()</b>, <b>state()</b>, and
<b>local()</b> operators, and also the effect of the
experimental &quot;reference aliasing,&quot; which may
change), or until the next &quot;package&quot; declaration.
Unqualified dynamic identifiers will be in this namespace,
except for those few identifiers that, if unqualified,
default to the main package instead of the current one as
described below. A &quot;package&quot; statement affects
only dynamic global symbols, including subroutine names, and
variables you&rsquo;ve used <b>local()</b> on, but
<i>not</i> lexical variables created with <b>my()</b>,
<b>our()</b> or <b>state()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Typically, a
&quot;package&quot; statement is the first declaration in a
file included in a program by one of the &quot;do&quot;,
&quot;require&quot;, or &quot;use&quot; operators. You can
switch into a package in more than one place:
&quot;package&quot; has no effect beyond specifying which
symbol table the compiler will use for dynamic symbols for
the rest of that block or until the next &quot;package&quot;
statement. You can refer to variables and filehandles in
other packages by prefixing the identifier with the package
name and a double colon: $Package::Variable. If the package
name is null, the &quot;main&quot; package is assumed. That
is, $::sail is equivalent to $main::sail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The old package
delimiter was a single quote, but double colon is now the
preferred delimiter, in part because it&rsquo;s more
readable to humans, and in part because it&rsquo;s more
readable to <b>emacs</b> macros. It also makes C
<small>++</small> programmers feel like they know
what&rsquo;s going on--as opposed to using the single quote
as separator, which was there to make Ada programmers feel
like they knew what was going on. Because the old-fashioned
syntax is still supported for backwards compatibility, if
you try to use a string like &quot;This is $owner's
house&quot;, you&rsquo;ll be accessing $owner::s; that is,
the $s variable in package &quot;owner&quot;, which is
probably not what you meant. Use braces to disambiguate, as
in &quot;This is ${owner}'s house&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Packages may
themselves contain package separators, as in
$OUTER::INNER::var. This implies nothing about the order of
name lookups, however. There are no relative packages: all
symbols are either local to the current package, or must be
fully qualified from the outer package name down. For
instance, there is nowhere within package &quot;OUTER&quot;
that $INNER::var refers to $OUTER::INNER::var.
&quot;INNER&quot; refers to a totally separate global
package. The custom of treating package names as a hierarchy
is very strong, but the language in no way enforces it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Only
identifiers starting with letters (or underscore) are stored
in a package&rsquo;s symbol table. All other symbols are
kept in package &quot;main&quot;, including all punctuation
variables, like $_. In addition, when unqualified, the
identifiers <small>STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR, ARGV, ARGVOUT,
ENV, INC,</small> and <small>SIG</small> are forced to be in
package &quot;main&quot;, even when used for other purposes
than their built-in ones. If you have a package called
&quot;m&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, or &quot;y&quot;, then you
can&rsquo;t use the qualified form of an identifier because
it would be instead interpreted as a pattern match, a
substitution, or a transliteration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Variables
beginning with underscore used to be forced into package
main, but we decided it was more useful for package writers
to be able to use leading underscore to indicate private
variables and method names. However, variables and functions
named with a single &quot;_&quot;, such as $_ and &quot;sub
_&quot;, are still forced into the package &quot;main&quot;.
See also &quot;The Syntax of Variable Names&quot; in
perlvar.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;eval&quot;ed
strings are compiled in the package in which the
<b>eval()</b> was compiled. (Assignments to $SIG{}, however,
assume the signal handler specified is in the
&quot;main&quot; package. Qualify the signal handler name if
you wish to have a signal handler in a package.) For an
example, examine <i>perldb.pl</i> in the Perl library. It
initially switches to the &quot;DB&quot; package so that the
debugger doesn&rsquo;t interfere with variables in the
program you are trying to debug. At various points, however,
it temporarily switches back to the &quot;main&quot; package
to evaluate various expressions in the context of the
&quot;main&quot; package (or wherever you came from). See
perldebug.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The special
symbol &quot;__PACKAGE__&quot; contains the current package,
but cannot (easily) be used to construct variable names.
After &quot;my($foo)&quot; has hidden package variable $foo,
it can still be accessed, without knowing what package you
are in, as &quot;${__PACKAGE__.'::foo'}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See perlsub for
other scoping issues related to <b>my()</b> and
<b>local()</b>, and perlref regarding closures.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Symbol
Tables</b> <br>
The symbol table for a package happens to be stored in the
hash of that name with two colons appended. The main symbol
table&rsquo;s name is thus %main::, or %:: for short.
Likewise the symbol table for the nested package mentioned
earlier is named %OUTER::INNER::.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The value in
each entry of the hash is what you are referring to when you
use the *name typeglob notation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">local
*main::foo = *main::bar;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can use
this to print out all the variables in a package, for
instance. The standard but antiquated <i>dumpvar.pl</i>
library and the <small>CPAN</small> module Devel::Symdump
make use of this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The results of
creating new symbol table entries directly or modifying any
entries that are not already typeglobs are undefined and
subject to change between releases of perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Assignment to a
typeglob performs an aliasing operation, i.e.,</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*dick =
*richard;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">causes
variables, subroutines, formats, and file and directory
handles accessible via the identifier &quot;richard&quot;
also to be accessible via the identifier &quot;dick&quot;.
If you want to alias only a particular variable or
subroutine, assign a reference instead:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*dick =
\$richard;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Which makes
$richard and $dick the same variable, but leaves @richard
and @dick as separate arrays. Tricky, eh?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is one
subtle difference between the following statements:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*foo = *bar;
<br>
*foo = \$bar;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;*foo =
*bar&quot; makes the typeglobs themselves synonymous while
&quot;*foo = \$bar&quot; makes the <small>SCALAR</small>
portions of two distinct typeglobs refer to the same scalar
value. This means that the following code:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$bar = 1; <br>
*foo = \$bar; # Make $foo an alias for $bar <br>
{ <br>
local $bar = 2; # Restrict changes to block <br>
print $foo; # Prints '1'! <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Would print
&rsquo;1&rsquo;, because $foo holds a reference to the
<i>original</i> $bar. The one that was stuffed away by
&quot;local()&quot; and which will be restored when the
block ends. Because variables are accessed through the
typeglob, you can use &quot;*foo = *bar&quot; to create an
alias which can be localized. (But be aware that this means
you can&rsquo;t have a separate @foo and @bar, etc.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What makes all
of this important is that the Exporter module uses glob
aliasing as the import/export mechanism. Whether or not you
can properly localize a variable that has been exported from
a module depends on how it was exported:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">@EXPORT =
qw($FOO); # Usual form, can't be localized <br>
@EXPORT = qw(*FOO); # Can be localized</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can work
around the first case by using the fully qualified name
($Package::FOO) where you need a local value, or by
overriding it by saying &quot;*FOO = *Package::FOO&quot; in
your script.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The &quot;*x =
\$y&quot; mechanism may be used to pass and return cheap
references into or from subroutines if you don&rsquo;t want
to copy the whole thing. It only works when assigning to
dynamic variables, not lexicals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">%some_hash =
(); # can't be my() <br>
*some_hash = fn( \%another_hash ); <br>
sub fn { <br>
local *hashsym = shift; <br>
# now use %hashsym normally, and you <br>
# will affect the caller's %another_hash <br>
my %nhash = (); # do what you want <br>
return \%nhash; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On return, the
reference will overwrite the hash slot in the symbol table
specified by the *some_hash typeglob. This is a somewhat
tricky way of passing around references cheaply when you
don&rsquo;t want to have to remember to dereference
variables explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another use of
symbol tables is for making &quot;constant&quot;
scalars.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">*PI =
\3.14159265358979;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now you cannot
alter $PI, which is probably a good thing all in all. This
isn&rsquo;t the same as a constant subroutine, which is
subject to optimization at compile-time. A constant
subroutine is one prototyped to take no arguments and to
return a constant expression. See perlsub for details on
these. The &quot;use constant&quot; pragma is a convenient
shorthand for these.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can say
*foo{PACKAGE} and *foo{NAME} to find out what name and
package the *foo symbol table entry comes from. This may be
useful in a subroutine that gets passed typeglobs as
arguments:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sub
identify_typeglob { <br>
my $glob = shift; <br>
print 'You gave me ', *{$glob}{PACKAGE}, <br>
'::', *{$glob}{NAME}, &quot;\n&quot;; <br>
} <br>
identify_typeglob *foo; <br>
identify_typeglob *bar::baz;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This prints</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You gave me
main::foo <br>
You gave me bar::baz</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The *foo{THING}
notation can also be used to obtain references to the
individual elements of *foo. See perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Subroutine
definitions (and declarations, for that matter) need not
necessarily be situated in the package whose symbol table
they occupy. You can define a subroutine outside its package
by explicitly qualifying the name of the subroutine:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package main;
<br>
sub Some_package::foo { ... } # &amp;foo defined in
Some_package</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is just a
shorthand for a typeglob assignment at compile time:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN {
*Some_package::foo = sub { ... } }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and is
<i>not</i> the same as writing:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">{ <br>
package Some_package; <br>
sub foo { ... } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the first
two versions, the body of the subroutine is lexically in the
main package, <i>not</i> in Some_package. So something like
this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package main;
<br>
$Some_package::name = &quot;fred&quot;; <br>
$main::name = &quot;barney&quot;; <br>
sub Some_package::foo { <br>
print &quot;in &quot;, __PACKAGE__, &quot;: \$name is
'$name'\n&quot;; <br>
} <br>
Some_package::foo();</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">prints:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">in main: $name
is 'barney'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rather
than:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">in
Some_package: $name is 'fred'</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This also has
implications for the use of the <small>SUPER::</small>
qualifier (see perlobj).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>BEGIN,
UNITCHECK, CHECK, INIT</small> and <small>END</small></b>
<br>
Five specially named code blocks are executed at the
beginning and at the end of a running Perl program. These
are the &quot;BEGIN&quot;, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot;,
&quot;CHECK&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot;, and &quot;END&quot;
blocks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These code
blocks can be prefixed with &quot;sub&quot; to give the
appearance of a subroutine (although this is not considered
good style). One should note that these code blocks
don&rsquo;t really exist as named subroutines (despite their
appearance). The thing that gives this away is the fact that
you can have <b>more than one</b> of these code blocks in a
program, and they will get <b>all</b> executed at the
appropriate moment. So you can&rsquo;t execute any of these
code blocks by name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
&quot;BEGIN&quot; code block is executed as soon as
possible, that is, the moment it is completely defined, even
before the rest of the containing file (or string) is
parsed. You may have multiple &quot;BEGIN&quot; blocks
within a file (or eval&rsquo;ed string); they will execute
in order of definition. Because a &quot;BEGIN&quot; code
block executes immediately, it can pull in definitions of
subroutines and such from other files in time to be visible
to the rest of the compile and run time. Once a
&quot;BEGIN&quot; has run, it is immediately undefined and
any code it used is returned to Perl&rsquo;s memory
pool.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An
&quot;END&quot; code block is executed as late as possible,
that is, after perl has finished running the program and
just before the interpreter is being exited, even if it is
exiting as a result of a <b>die()</b> function. (But not if
it&rsquo;s morphing into another program via
&quot;exec&quot;, or being blown out of the water by a
signal--you have to trap that yourself (if you can).) You
may have multiple &quot;END&quot; blocks within a file--they
will execute in reverse order of definition; that is: last
in, first out ( <small>LIFO</small> ). &quot;END&quot;
blocks are not executed when you run perl with the
&quot;&minus;c&quot; switch, or if compilation fails.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
&quot;END&quot; code blocks are <b>not</b> executed at the
end of a string &quot;eval()&quot;: if any &quot;END&quot;
code blocks are created in a string &quot;eval()&quot;, they
will be executed just as any other &quot;END&quot; code
block of that package in <small>LIFO</small> order just
before the interpreter is being exited.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside an
&quot;END&quot; code block, $? contains the value that the
program is going to pass to &quot;exit()&quot;. You can
modify $? to change the exit value of the program. Beware of
changing $? by accident (e.g. by running something via
&quot;system&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside of a
&quot;END&quot; block, the value of
&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; will be &quot;END&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similar to an
&quot;END&quot; block are &quot;defer&quot; blocks, though
they operate on the lifetime of individual block scopes,
rather than the program as a whole. They are documented in
&quot;defer&quot; in perlsyn.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;,
&quot;CHECK&quot; and &quot;INIT&quot; code blocks are
useful to catch the transition between the compilation phase
and the execution phase of the main program.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;
blocks are run just after the unit which defined them has
been compiled. The main program file and each module it
loads are compilation units, as are string
&quot;eval&quot;s, run-time code compiled using the
&quot;(?{ })&quot; construct in a regex, calls to &quot;do
FILE&quot;, &quot;require FILE&quot;, and code after the
&quot;&minus;e&quot; switch on the command line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;BEGIN&quot;
and &quot;UNITCHECK&quot; blocks are not directly related to
the phase of the interpreter. They can be created and
executed during any phase.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;CHECK&quot;
code blocks are run just after the <b>initial</b> Perl
compile phase ends and before the run time begins, in
<small>LIFO</small> order. &quot;CHECK&quot; code blocks are
used in the Perl compiler suite to save the compiled state
of the program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside of a
&quot;CHECK&quot; block, the value of
&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; will be &quot;CHECK&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;INIT&quot;
blocks are run just before the Perl runtime begins
execution, in &quot;first in, first out&quot; (
<small>FIFO</small> ) order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Inside of an
&quot;INIT&quot; block, the value of
&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot; will be &quot;INIT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;CHECK&quot; and &quot;INIT&quot; blocks in code
compiled by &quot;require&quot;, string &quot;do&quot;, or
string &quot;eval&quot; will not be executed if they occur
after the end of the main compilation phase; that can be a
problem in mod_perl and other persistent environments which
use those functions to load code at runtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you use
the <b>&minus;n</b> and <b>&minus;p</b> switches to Perl,
&quot;BEGIN&quot; and &quot;END&quot; work just as they do
in <b>awk</b>, as a degenerate case. Both &quot;BEGIN&quot;
and &quot;CHECK&quot; blocks are run when you use the
<b>&minus;c</b> switch for a compile-only syntax check,
although your main code is not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>begincheck</b> program makes it all clear,
eventually:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#!/usr/bin/perl
<br>
# begincheck <br>
print &quot;10. Ordinary code runs at runtime.\n&quot;; <br>
END { print &quot;16. So this is the end of the
tale.\n&quot; } <br>
INIT { print &quot; 7. INIT blocks run FIFO just before
runtime.\n&quot; } <br>
UNITCHECK { <br>
print &quot; 4. And therefore before any CHECK
blocks.\n&quot; <br>
} <br>
CHECK { print &quot; 6. So this is the sixth line.\n&quot; }
<br>
print &quot;11. It runs in order, of course.\n&quot;; <br>
BEGIN { print &quot; 1. BEGIN blocks run FIFO during
compilation.\n&quot; } <br>
END { print &quot;15. Read perlmod for the rest of the
story.\n&quot; } <br>
CHECK { print &quot; 5. CHECK blocks run LIFO after all
compilation.\n&quot; } <br>
INIT { print &quot; 8. Run this again, using Perl's &minus;c
switch.\n&quot; } <br>
print &quot;12. This is anti&minus;obfuscated code.\n&quot;;
<br>
END { print &quot;14. END blocks run LIFO at quitting
time.\n&quot; } <br>
BEGIN { print &quot; 2. So this line comes out
second.\n&quot; } <br>
UNITCHECK { <br>
print &quot; 3. UNITCHECK blocks run LIFO after each file is
compiled.\n&quot; <br>
} <br>
INIT { print &quot; 9. You'll see the difference right
away.\n&quot; } <br>
print &quot;13. It only _looks_ like it should be
confusing.\n&quot;; <br>
__END__</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
Classes</b> <br>
There is no special class syntax in Perl, but a package may
act as a class if it provides subroutines to act as methods.
Such a package may also derive some of its methods from
another class (package) by listing the other package name(s)
in its global @ISA array (which must be a package global,
not a lexical).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more on
this, see perlootut and perlobj.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perl
Modules</b> <br>
A module is just a set of related functions in a library
file, i.e., a Perl package with the same name as the file.
It is specifically designed to be reusable by other modules
or programs. It may do this by providing a mechanism for
exporting some of its symbols into the symbol table of any
package using it, or it may function as a class definition
and make its semantics available implicitly through method
calls on the class and its objects, without explicitly
exporting anything. Or it can do a little of both.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example, to
start a traditional, non-OO module called Some::Module,
create a file called <i>Some/Module.pm</i> and start with
this template:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
Some::Module; # assumes Some/Module.pm <br>
use v5.36; <br>
# Get the import method from Exporter to export functions
and <br>
# variables <br>
use Exporter 5.57 'import'; <br>
# set the version for version checking <br>
our $VERSION = '1.00'; <br>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then go on to
declare and use your variables in functions without any
qualifications. See Exporter and the perlmodlib for details
on mechanics and style issues in module creation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl modules
are included into your program by saying</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use Module;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use Module
LIST;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This is exactly
equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require
'Module.pm'; 'Module'&minus;&gt;import; }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require
'Module.pm'; 'Module'&minus;&gt;import( LIST ); }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a special
case</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use Module
();</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is exactly
equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { require
'Module.pm'; }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All Perl module
files have the extension <i>.pm</i>. The &quot;use&quot;
operator assumes this so you don&rsquo;t have to spell out
&quot;<i>Module.pm</i>&quot; in quotes. This also helps to
differentiate new modules from old <i>.pl</i> and <i>.ph</i>
files. Module names are also capitalized unless
they&rsquo;re functioning as pragmas; pragmas are in effect
compiler directives, and are sometimes called
&quot;pragmatic modules&quot; (or even &quot;pragmata&quot;
if you&rsquo;re a classicist).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The two
statements:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">require
SomeModule; <br>
require &quot;SomeModule.pm&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">differ from
each other in two ways. In the first case, any double colons
in the module name, such as &quot;Some::Module&quot;, are
translated into your system&rsquo;s directory separator,
usually &quot;/&quot;. The second case does not, and would
have to be specified literally. The other difference is that
seeing the first &quot;require&quot; clues in the compiler
that uses of indirect object notation involving
&quot;SomeModule&quot;, as in &quot;$ob = purge
SomeModule&quot;, are method calls, not function calls.
(Yes, this really can make a difference.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because the
&quot;use&quot; statement implies a &quot;BEGIN&quot; block,
the importing of semantics happens as soon as the
&quot;use&quot; statement is compiled, before the rest of
the file is compiled. This is how it is able to function as
a pragma mechanism, and also how modules are able to declare
subroutines that are then visible as list or unary operators
for the rest of the current file. This will not work if you
use &quot;require&quot; instead of &quot;use&quot;. With
&quot;require&quot; you can get into this problem:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">require Cwd; #
make Cwd:: accessible <br>
$here = Cwd::getcwd(); <br>
use Cwd; # import names from Cwd:: <br>
$here = getcwd(); <br>
require Cwd; # make Cwd:: accessible <br>
$here = getcwd(); # oops! no main::getcwd()</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
&quot;use Module ()&quot; is recommended over &quot;require
Module&quot;, because it determines module availability at
compile time, not in the middle of your program&rsquo;s
execution. An exception would be if two modules each tried
to &quot;use&quot; each other, and each also called a
function from that other module. In that case, it&rsquo;s
easy to use &quot;require&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl packages
may be nested inside other package names, so we can have
package names containing &quot;::&quot;. But if we used that
package name directly as a filename it would make for
unwieldy or impossible filenames on some systems. Therefore,
if a module&rsquo;s name is, say, &quot;Text::Soundex&quot;,
then its definition is actually found in the library file
<i>Text/Soundex.pm</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl modules
always have a <i>.pm</i> file, but there may also be
dynamically linked executables (often ending in <i>.so</i>)
or autoloaded subroutine definitions (often ending in
<i>.al</i>) associated with the module. If so, these will be
entirely transparent to the user of the module. It is the
responsibility of the <i>.pm</i> file to load (or arrange to
autoload) any additional functionality. For example,
although the <small>POSIX</small> module happens to do both
dynamic loading and autoloading, the user can say just
&quot;use POSIX&quot; to get it all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Making your
module threadsafe</b> <br>
Perl supports a type of threads called interpreter threads
(ithreads). These threads can be used explicitly and
implicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ithreads work
by cloning the data tree so that no data is shared between
different threads. These threads can be used by using the
&quot;threads&quot; module or by doing <b>fork()</b> on
win32 (fake <b>fork()</b> support). When a thread is cloned
all Perl data is cloned, however non-Perl data cannot be
cloned automatically. Perl after 5.8.0 has support for the
&quot;CLONE&quot; special subroutine. In &quot;CLONE&quot;
you can do whatever you need to do, like for example handle
the cloning of non-Perl data, if necessary.
&quot;CLONE&quot; will be called once as a class method for
every package that has it defined (or inherits it). It will
be called in the context of the new thread, so all
modifications are made in the new area. Currently
<small>CLONE</small> is called with no parameters other than
the invocant package name, but code should not assume that
this will remain unchanged, as it is likely that in future
extra parameters will be passed in to give more information
about the state of cloning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
<small>CLONE</small> all objects you will need to keep track
of them per package. This is simply done using a hash and
<b>Scalar::Util::weaken()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl after
5.8.7 has support for the &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; special
subroutine. Like &quot;CLONE&quot;, &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot;
is called once per package; however, it is called just
before cloning starts, and in the context of the parent
thread. If it returns a true value, then no objects of that
class will be cloned; or rather, they will be copied as
unblessed, undef values. For example: if in the parent there
are two references to a single blessed hash, then in the
child there will be two references to a single undefined
scalar value instead. This provides a simple mechanism for
making a module threadsafe; just add &quot;sub CLONE_SKIP {
1 }&quot; at the top of the class, and &quot;DESTROY()&quot;
will now only be called once per object. Of course, if the
child thread needs to make use of the objects, then a more
sophisticated approach is needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Like
&quot;CLONE&quot;, &quot;CLONE_SKIP&quot; is currently
called with no parameters other than the invocant package
name, although that may change. Similarly, to allow for
future expansion, the return value should be a single 0 or 1
value.</p>
