<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Xnest</b> [
<i>options</i> ]</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Xnest</b> is
both an X client and an X server. <b>Xnest</b> is a client
of the real server which manages windows and graphics
requests on its behalf. <b>Xnest</b> is a server to its own
clients. <b>Xnest</b> manages windows and graphics requests
on their behalf. To these clients, <b>Xnest</b> appears to
be a conventional server.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Xnest</b>
supports all standard options of the sample server
implementation. For more details, please see
<b>Xserver</b>(1). The following additional arguments are
supported as well. <b><br>
&minus;display</b> <i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies the
display name of the real server that <b>Xnest</b> should try
to connect to. If it is not provided on the command line,
<b>Xnest</b> will read the <i>DISPLAY</i> environment
variable in order to find out this information.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>&minus;sync</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to synchronize its window
and graphics operations with the real server. This is a
useful option for debugging, but it will slow down
<b>Xnest</b>&rsquo;s performance considerably. It should not
be used unless absolutely necessary.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>&minus;full</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to utilize full
regeneration of real server objects and reopen a new
connection to the real server each time the nested server
regenerates. The sample server implementation regenerates
all objects in the server when the last client of this
server terminates. When this happens, <b>Xnest</b> by
default maintains the same top-level window and the same
real server connection in each new generation. If the user
selects full regeneration, even the top-level window and the
connection to the real server will be regenerated for each
server generation.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;class</b>
<i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies the
default visual class of the nested server. It is similar to
the <b>&minus;cc</b> option from the set of standard options
except that it will accept a string rather than a number for
the visual class specification. The <i>string</i> must be
one of the following six values: <b>StaticGray</b>,
<b>GrayScale</b>, <b>StaticColor</b>, <b>PseudoColor</b>,
<b>TrueColor</b>, or <b>DirectColor</b>. If both the
<b>&minus;class</b> and <b>&minus;cc</b> options are
specified, the last instance of either option takes
precedence. The class of the default visual of the nested
server need not be the same as the class of the default
visual of the real server, but it must be supported by the
real server. Use <b>xdpyinfo</b>(1) to obtain a list of
supported visual classes on the real server before starting
<b>Xnest</b>. If the user chooses a static class, all the
colors in the default color map will be preallocated. If the
user chooses a dynamic class, colors in the default color
map will be available to individual clients for
allocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;depth</b>
<i>int</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies the
default visual depth of the nested server. The depth of the
default visual of the nested server need not be the same as
the depth of the default visual of the real server, but it
must be supported by the real server. Use <b>xdpyinfo</b>(1)
to obtain a list of supported visual depths on the real
server before starting <b>Xnest</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>&minus;sss</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to use the software
screen saver. By default, <b>Xnest</b> will use the screen
saver that corresponds to the hardware screen saver in the
real server. Of course, even this screen saver is
software-generated since <b>Xnest</b> does not control any
actual hardware. However, it is treated as a hardware screen
saver within the sample server code.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;geometry</b>
<i>W</i><b>x</b><i>H</i><b>+</b><i>X</i><b>+</b><i>Y</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies the
geometry parameters for the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window.
See &ldquo;GEOMETRY SPECIFICATIONS&rdquo; in <b>X</b>(7) for
a discussion of this option&rsquo;s syntax. This window
corresponds to the root window of the nested server. The
width <i>W</i> and height <i>H</i> specified with this
option will be the maximum width and height of each
top-level <b>Xnest</b> window. <b>Xnest</b> will allow the
user to make any top-level window smaller, but it will not
actually change the size of the nested server root window.
<b>Xnest</b> does not yet support the RANDR extension for
resizing, rotation, and reflection of the root window. If
this option is not specified, <b>Xnest</b> will choose
<i>W</i> and <i>H</i> to be 3/4ths the dimensions of the
root window of the real server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;bw</b> <i>int</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies the
border width of the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window. The
integer parameter <i>int</i> must be positive. The default
border width is 1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;name</b>
<i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies the name
of the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window as <i>string</i>. The
default value is the program name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;scrns</b>
<i>int</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option specifies the
number of screens to create in the nested server. For each
screen, <b>Xnest</b> will create a separate top-level
window. Each screen is referenced by the number after the
dot in the client display name specification. For example,
<b>xterm &minus;display :1.1</b> will open an
<b>xterm</b>(1) client in the nested server with the display
number <b>:1</b> on the second screen. The number of screens
is limited by the hard-coded constant in the server sample
code, which is usually 3.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;install</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option tells <b>Xnest</b>
to do its own color map installation by bypassing the real
window manager. For it to work properly, the user will
probably have to temporarily quit the real window manager.
By default, <b>Xnest</b> will keep the nested client window
whose color map should be installed in the real server in
the <i>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</i> property of the top-level
<b>Xnest</b> window. If this color map is of the same visual
type as the root window of the nested server, <b>Xnest</b>
will associate this color map with the top-level
<b>Xnest</b> window as well. Since this does not have to be
the case, window managers should look primarily at the
<i>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</i> property rather than the color
map associated with the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window.
Unfortunately, window managers are not very good at doing
that yet so this option might come in handy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;parent</b>
<i>window_id</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option tells <b>Xnest</b>
to use <i>window_id</i> as the root window instead of
creating a window.</p>

<h2>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
<a name="EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Starting up
<b>Xnest</b> is just as simple as starting up
<b>xclock</b>(1) from a terminal emulator. If a user wishes
to run <b>Xnest</b> on the same workstation as the real
server, it is important that the nested server is given its
own listening socket address. Therefore, if there is a
server already running on the user&rsquo;s workstation,
<b>Xnest</b> will have to be started up with a new display
number. Since there is usually no more than one server
running on a workstation, specifying &lsquo;<b>Xnest
:1</b>&rsquo; on the command line will be sufficient for
most users. For each server running on the workstation, the
display number needs to be incremented by one. Thus, if you
wish to start another <b>Xnest</b>, you will need to type
&lsquo;<b>Xnest :2</b>&rsquo; on the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To run clients
in the nested server, each client needs to be given the same
display number as the nested server. For example,
&lsquo;<b>xterm &minus;display :1</b>&rsquo; will start up
an <b>xterm</b> process in the first nested server and
&lsquo;<b>xterm &minus;display :2</b>&rsquo; will start an
<b>xterm</b> in the second nested server from the example
above. Additional clients can be started from these
<b>xterm</b>s in each nested server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Xnest as a
client <br>
Xnest</b> behaves and looks to the real server and other
real clients as another real client. It is a rather
demanding client, however, since almost any window or
graphics request from a nested client will result in a
window or graphics request from <b>Xnest</b> to the real
server. Therefore, it is desirable that <b>Xnest</b> and the
real server are on a local network, or even better, on the
same machine. <b>Xnest</b> assumes that the real server
supports the SHAPE extension. There is no way to turn off
this assumption dynamically. <b>Xnest</b> can be compiled
without the SHAPE extension built in, in which case the real
server need not support it. Dynamic SHAPE extension
selection support may be considered in further development
of <b>Xnest</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
<b>Xnest</b> need not use the same default visual as the the
real server, the top-level window of the <b>Xnest</b> client
always has its own color map. This implies that other
windows&rsquo; colors will not be displayed properly while
the keyboard or pointer focus is in the <b>Xnest</b> window,
unless the real server has support for more than one
installed color map at any time. The color map associated
with the top window of the <b>Xnest</b> client need not be
the appropriate color map that the nested server wants
installed in the real server. In the case that a nested
client attempts to install a color map of a different visual
from the default visual of the nested server, <b>Xnest</b>
will put the top window of this nested client and all other
top windows of the nested clients that use the same color
map into the <i>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</i> property of the
top-level <b>Xnest</b> window on the real server. Thus, it
is important that the real window manager that manages the
<b>Xnest</b> top-level window looks at the
<i>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</i> property rather than the color
map associated with the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window. Since
most window managers don&rsquo;t yet appear to implement
this convention properly, <b>Xnest</b> can optionally do
direct installation of color maps into the real server
bypassing the real window manager. If the user chooses this
option, it is usually necessary to temporarily disable the
real window manager since it will interfere with the
<b>Xnest</b> scheme of color map installation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keyboard and
pointer control procedures of the nested server change the
keyboard and pointer control parameters of the real server.
Therefore, after <b>Xnest</b> is started up, it will change
the keyboard and pointer controls of the real server to its
own internal defaults.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Xnest as a
server <br>
Xnest</b> as a server looks exactly like a real server to
its own clients. For the clients, there is no way of telling
if they are running on a real or a nested server.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As already
mentioned, <b>Xnest</b> is a very user-friendly server when
it comes to customization. <b>Xnest</b> will pick up a
number of command-line arguments that can configure its
default visual class and depth, number of screens, etc.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The only
apparent intricacy from the users&rsquo; perspective about
using <b>Xnest</b> as a server is the selection of fonts.
<b>Xnest</b> manages fonts by loading them locally and then
passing the font name to the real server and asking it to
load that font remotely. This approach avoids the overload
of sending the glyph bits across the network for every text
operation, although it is really a bug. The consequence of
this approach is that the user will have to worry about two
different font paths &mdash; a local one for the nested
server and a remote one for the real server &mdash; since
<b>Xnest</b> does not propagate its font path to the real
server. The reason for this is because real and nested
servers need not run on the same file system which makes the
two font paths mutually incompatible. Thus, if there is a
font in the local font path of the nested server, there is
no guarantee that this font exists in the remote font path
of the real server. The <b>xlsfonts</b>(1) client, if run on
the nested server, will list fonts in the local font path
and, if run on the real server, will list fonts in the
remote font path. Before a font can be successfully opened
by the nested server, it has to exist in local and remote
font paths. It is the users&rsquo; responsibility to make
sure that this is the case.</p>

<h2>FUTURE DIRECTIONS
<a name="FUTURE DIRECTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Make dynamic
the requirement for the SHAPE extension in the real server,
rather than having to recompile <b>Xnest</b> to turn this
requirement on and off.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perhaps there
should be a command-line option to tell <b>Xnest</b> to
inherit the keyboard and pointer control parameters from the
real server rather than imposing its own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Xnest</b>
should read a customization input file to provide even
greater freedom and simplicity in selecting the desired
layout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
support for backing store and save unders, but this should
also be considered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The proper
implementation of fonts should be moved into the <i>os</i>
layer.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Doesn&rsquo;t
run well on servers supporting different visual depths.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Still crashes
randomly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Probably has
some memory leaks.</p>
