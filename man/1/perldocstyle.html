&minus; A style guide for writing Perl&rsquo;s
documentation</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
is a guide for the authorship and maintenance of the
documentation that ships with Perl. This includes the
following:</p>

<p>The several dozen manual sections whose filenames begin

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This guide will
hereafter refer to user-manual section files as <i>man
pages</i>, per Unix convention.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Purpose of
this guide</b> <br>
This style guide aims to establish standards, procedures,
and philosophies applicable to Perl&rsquo;s core
documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Adherence to
these standards will help ensure that any one part of
Perl&rsquo;s manual has a tone and style consistent with
that of any other. As with the rest of the Perl project, the
language&rsquo;s documentation collection is an open-source
project authored over a long period of time by many people.
Maintaining consistency across such a wide swath of work
presents a challenge; this guide provides a foundation to
help mitigate this difficulty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This will help
its readers--especially those new to Perl--to feel more
welcome and engaged with Perl&rsquo;s documentation, and
this in turn will help the Perl project itself grow stronger
through having a larger, more diverse, and more confident
population of knowledgeable users.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Intended
audience</b> <br>
Anyone interested in contributing to Perl&rsquo;s core
documentation should familiarize themselves with the
standards outlined by this guide.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Programmers
documenting their own work apart from the Perl project
itself may also find this guide worthwhile, especially if
they wish their work to extend the tone and style of
Perl&rsquo;s own manual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Status of
this document</b> <br>
This guide was initially drafted in late 2020, drawing from
the documentation style guides of several open-source
technologies contemporary with Perl. This has included
Python, Raku, Rust, and the Linux kernel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The author
intends to see this guide used as starting place from which
to launch a review of Perl&rsquo;s reams of extant
documentation, with the expectation that those conducting
this review should grow and modify this guide as needed to
account for the requirements and quirks particular to
Perl&rsquo;s programming manual.</p>

<h2>FUNDAMENTALS
<a name="FUNDAMENTALS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Choice of
markup: Pod</b> <br>
All of Perl&rsquo;s core documentation uses Pod (&quot;Plain
Old Documentation&quot;), a simple markup language, to
format its source text. Pod is similar in spirit to other
contemporary lightweight markup technologies, such as
Markdown and reStructuredText, and has a decades-long shared
history with Perl itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For a
comprehensive reference to Pod syntax, see
&quot;perlpod&quot;. For the sake of reading this guide,
familiarity with the Pod syntax for section headers
(&quot;=head2&quot;, et cetera) and for inline text
formatting (&quot;C&lt;like this&gt;&quot;) should
suffice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl
programmers also use Pod to document their own scripts,
libraries, and modules. This use of Pod has its own style
guide, outlined by &quot;perlpodstyle&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Choice of
language: American English</b> <br>
Perl&rsquo;s core documentation is written in English, with
a preference for American spelling of words and expression
of phrases. That means &quot;color&quot; over
&quot;colour&quot;, &quot;math&quot; versus
&quot;maths&quot;, &quot;the team has decided&quot; and not
&quot;the team have decided&quot;, and so on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">We name one
style of English for the sake of consistency across
Perl&rsquo;s documentation, much as a software project might
declare a four-space indentation standard--even when that
doesn&rsquo;t affect how well the code compiles. Both
efforts result in an easier read by avoiding jarring,
mid-document changes in format or style.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Contributors to
Perl&rsquo;s documentation should note that this rule
describes the ultimate, published output of the project, and
does not prescribe the dialect used within community
contributions. The documentation team enthusiastically
welcomes any English-language contributions, and will
actively assist in Americanizing spelling and style when
warranted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Other
languages and translations</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Community-authored
translations of Perl&rsquo;s documentation do exist,
covering a variety of languages. While the Perl project
appreciates these translation efforts and promotes them when
applicable, it does not officially support or maintain any
of them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">That said,
keeping Perl&rsquo;s documentation clear, simple, and short
has a welcome side effect of aiding any such translation
project.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(Note that the
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean-language <small>README</small>
files included with Perl&rsquo;s source distributions
provide an exception to this choice of language--but these
documents fall outside the scope of this guide.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Choice of
encoding: <small>UTF&minus;8</small></b> <br>
Perl&rsquo;s core documentation files are encoded in
<small>UTF&minus;8,</small> and can make use of the full
range of characters this encoding allows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As such, every
core doc file (or the Pod section of every core module)
should commence with an &quot;=encoding utf8&quot;
declaration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Choice of
underlying style guide: <small>CMOS</small></b> <br>
Perl&rsquo;s documentation uses the Chicago Manual of Style
&lt;https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org&gt; (
<small>CMOS</small> ), 17th Edition, as its baseline guide
for style and grammar. While the document you are currently
reading endeavors to serve as an adequate stand-alone style
guide for the purposes of documenting Perl, authors should
consider <small>CMOS</small> the fallback authority for any
pertinent topics not covered here.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Because
<small>CMOS</small> is not a free resource, access to it is
not a prerequisite for contributing to Perl&rsquo;s
documentation; the doc team will help contributors learn
about and apply its guidelines as needed. However, we do
encourage anyone interested in significant doc contributions
to obtain or at least read through <small>CMOS.</small>
(Copies are likely available through most public libraries,
and CMOS-derived fundamentals can be found online as
well.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Contributing
to Perl&rsquo;s documentation</b> <br>
Perl, like any programming language, is only as good as its
documentation. Perl depends upon clear, friendly, and
thorough documentation in order to welcome brand-new users,
teach and explain the language&rsquo;s various concepts and
components, and serve as a lifelong reference for
experienced Perl programmers. As such, the Perl project
welcomes and values all community efforts to improve the
language&rsquo;s documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl accepts
documentation contributions through the same open-source
project pipeline as code contributions. See
&quot;perlhack&quot; for more information.</p>

<h2>FORMATTING AND STRUCTURE
<a name="FORMATTING AND STRUCTURE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
details specific Pod syntax and style that all core Perl
documentation should adhere to, in the interest of
consistency and readability.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Document
structure</b> <br>
Each individual work of core Perl documentation, whether
contained within a &quot;.pod&quot; file or in the Pod
section of a standard code module, patterns its structure
after a number of long-time Unix man page conventions.
(Hence this guide&rsquo;s use of &quot;man page&quot; to
refer to any one self-contained part of Perl&rsquo;s
documentation.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Adhering to
these conventions helps Pod formatters present a Perl man
page&rsquo;s content in different contexts--whether a
terminal, the web, or even print. Many of the following
requirements originate with &quot;perlpodstyle&quot;, which
derives its recommendations in turn from these
well-established practices.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Name</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After its
&quot;=encoding utf8&quot; declaration, a Perl man page
<i>must</i> present a level-one header named &quot;
<small>NAME&quot;</small> (literally), followed by a
paragraph containing the page&rsquo;s name and a very brief
description.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The first few
lines of a notional page named
&quot;perlpodexample&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">=encoding utf8
<br>
=head1 NAME <br>
perlpodexample &minus; An example of formatting a manual
page's title line</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Description
and synopsis</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most Perl man
pages also contain a <small>DESCRIPTION</small> section
featuring a summary of, or introduction to, the
document&rsquo;s content and purpose.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
should also, one way or another, clearly identify the
audience that the page addresses, especially if it has
expectations about the reader&rsquo;s prior knowledge. For
example, a man page that dives deep into the inner workings
of Perl&rsquo;s regular expression engine should state its
assumptions up front--and quickly redirect readers who are
instead looking for a more basic reference or tutorial.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reference
pages, when appropriate, can precede the
<small>DESCRIPTION</small> with a <small>SYNOPSIS</small>
section that lists, within one or more code blocks, some
very brief examples of the referenced feature&rsquo;s use.
This section should show a handful of common-case and
best-practice examples, rather than an exhaustive list of
every obscure method or alternate syntax available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Other
sections and subsections</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pages should
conclude, when appropriate, with a <small>SEE ALSO</small>
section containing hyperlinks to relevant sections of
Perl&rsquo;s manual, other Unix man pages, or appropriate
web pages. Hyperlink each such cross-reference via
&quot;L&lt;...&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">What other
sections to include depends entirely upon the topic at hand.
Authors should feel free to include further
&quot;=head1&quot;&minus;level sections, whether other
standard ones listed by &quot;perlpodstyle&quot;, or ones
specific to the page&rsquo;s topic; in either case, render
these top-level headings in all-capital letters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may then
include as many subsections beneath them as needed to meet
the standards of clarity, accessibility, and cross-reference
affinity suggested elsewhere in this guide.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Author and
copyright</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In most
circumstances, Perl&rsquo;s stand-alone man pages--those
contained within &quot;.pod&quot; files--do not need to
include any copyright or license information about
themselves. Their source Pod files are part of Perl&rsquo;s
own core software repository, and that already covers them
under the same copyright and license terms as Perl itself.
You do not need to include additional &quot;
<small>LICENSE&quot;</small> or &quot;
<small>COPYRIGHT&quot;</small> sections of your own.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These man pages
may optionally credit their primary author, or include a
list of significant contributors, under &quot;
<small>AUTHOR&quot;</small> or &quot;
<small>CONTRIBUTORS&quot;</small> headings. Note that the
presence of authors&rsquo; names does not preclude a given
page from writing in a voice consistent with the rest of
Perl&rsquo;s documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that these
guidelines do not apply to the core software modules that
ship with Perl. These have their own standards for
authorship and copyright statements, as found in
&quot;perlpodstyle&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Formatting
rules</b> <i><br>
Line length and line wrap</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each line
within a Perl man page&rsquo;s Pod source file should
measure 72 characters or fewer in length.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Please break
paragraphs up into blocks of short lines, rather than
&quot;soft wrapping&quot; paragraphs across hundreds of
characters with no line breaks.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Code
blocks</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Just like the
text around them, all code examples should be as short and
readable as possible, displaying no more complexity than
absolutely necessary to illustrate the concept at hand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For the sake of
consistency within and across Perl&rsquo;s man pages, all
examples must adhere to the code-layout principles set out
by &quot;perlstyle&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sample code
should deviate from these standards only when necessary:
during a demonstration of how Perl disregards whitespace,
for example, or to temporarily switch to two-column
indentation for an unavoidably verbose illustration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You may include
comments within example code to further clarify or label the
code&rsquo;s behavior in-line. You may also use comments as
placeholder for code normally present but not relevant to
the current topic, like so:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">while (my $line
= &lt;$fh&gt;) { <br>
# <br>
# (Do something interesting with $line here.) <br>
# <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even the
simplest code blocks often require the use of example
variables and subroutines, whose names you should choose
with care.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Inline code
and literals</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Within a
paragraph of text, use &quot;C&lt;...&gt;&quot; when quoting
or referring to any bit of Perl code--even if it is only one
character long.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For instance,
when referring within an explanatory paragraph to
Perl&rsquo;s operator for adding two numbers together,
you&rsquo;d write &quot;&quot;C&lt;+&gt;&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Function
names</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use
&quot;C&lt;...&gt;&quot; to render all Perl function names
in monospace, whenever they appear in text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Unless you need
to specifically quote a function call with a list of
arguments, do not follow a function&rsquo;s name in text
with a pair of empty parentheses. That is, when referring in
general to Perl&rsquo;s &quot;print&quot; function, write it
as &quot;&quot;print&quot;&quot;, not
&quot;&quot;print()&quot;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Function
arguments</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Represent
functions&rsquo; expected arguments in all-caps, with no
sigils, and using &quot;C&lt;...&gt;&quot; to render them in
monospace. These arguments should have short names making
their nature and purpose clear. Convention specifies a few
ones commonly seen throughout Perl&rsquo;s
documentation:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="77%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;generic&quot; argument: any scalar value, or a Perl
expression that evaluates to one.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em"><small>LIST</small></p></td>
<td width="77%">
</td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any number of
values, stored across any number of variables or
expressions, which the function will &quot;flatten&quot; and
treat as a single list. (And because it can contain any
number of variables, it must be the <i>last</i> argument,
when present.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When possible,
give scalar arguments names that suggest their purpose among
the arguments. See, for example, &quot;substr&quot;&rsquo;s
documentation, whose listed arguments include
&quot;EXPR&quot;, &quot;OFFSET&quot;, &quot;LENGTH&quot;,
and &quot;REPLACEMENT&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Apostrophes,
quotes, and dashes</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Pod source,
use straight quotes, and not &quot;curly quotes&quot;:
&quot;Like <br>
this&quot;, not Xlike thisX. The same goes for apostrophes:
Here&rsquo;s a <br>
positive example, and hereXs a negative one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Render em
dashes as two hyphens--like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Render em
dashes as two hyphens&minus;&minus;like this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Leave it up to
formatters to reformat and reshape these punctuation marks
as best fits their respective target media.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unix
programs and C functions</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When referring
to a Unix program or C function with its own man page
(outside of Perl&rsquo;s documentation), include its manual
section number in parentheses. For example: malloc(3), or
mkdir(1).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If mentioning
this program for the first time within a man page or
section, make it a cross reference, e.g.
&quot;L&lt;malloc(3)&gt;&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Do not
otherwise style this text.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Cross-references
and hyperlinks</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Make generous
use of Pod&rsquo;s &quot;L&lt;...&gt;&quot; syntax to create
hyperlinks to other parts of the current man page, or to
other documents entirely -- whether elsewhere on the
reader&rsquo;s computer, or somewhere on the internet, via
<small>URL.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use
&quot;L&lt;...&gt;&quot; to link to another section of the
current man page when mentioning it, and make use of its
page-and-section syntax to link to the most specific section
of a separate page within Perl&rsquo;s documentation.
Generally, the first time you refer to a specific function,
program, or concept within a certain page or section,
consider linking to its full documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hyperlinks do
not supersede other formatting required by this guide; Pod
allows nested text formats, and you should use this feature
as needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
example sentence that mentions Perl&rsquo;s &quot;say&quot;
function, with a link to its documentation section within
the &quot;perlfunc&quot; man page:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In version
5.10, Perl added support for the <br>
L&lt;C&lt;say&gt;|perlfunc/say FILEHANDLE LIST&gt;
function.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note the use of
the vertical pipe (&quot;&quot;|&quot;&quot;) to separate
how the link will appear to readers
(&quot;&quot;C&lt;say&gt;&quot;&quot;) from the full
page-and-section specifier that the formatter links to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Tables and
diagrams</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pod does not
officially support tables. To best present tabular data,
include the table as both <small>HTML</small> and plain-text
representations--the latter as an indented code block. Use
&quot;=begin&quot; / &quot;=end&quot; directives to target
these tables at &quot;html&quot; and &quot;text&quot; Pod
formatters, respectively. For example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">=head2 Table of
fruits <br>
=begin text <br>
Name Shape Color <br>
===================================== <br>
Apple Round Red <br>
Banana Long Yellow <br>
Pear Pear&minus;shaped Green <br>
=end text <br>
=begin html <br>
&lt;table&gt; <br>

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Shape&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Color&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
<br>

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Apple&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Round&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Red&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
<br>

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Banana&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Long&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Yellow&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pear&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Pear&minus;shaped&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Green&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
<br>
&lt;/table&gt; <br>
=end html</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The same holds
true for figures and graphical illustrations. Pod does not
natively support inline graphics, but you can mix
<small>HTML</small> &quot;&lt;img&gt;&quot; tags with
monospaced text-art representations of those images&rsquo;
content.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Due in part to
these limitations, most Perl man pages use neither tables
nor diagrams. Like any other tool in your documentation
toolkit, however, you may consider their inclusion when they
would improve an explanation&rsquo;s clarity without adding
to its complexity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Adding
comments</b> <br>
Like any other kind of source code, Pod lets you insert
comments visible only to other people reading the source
directly, and ignored by the formatting programs that
transform Pod into various human-friendly output formats
(such as <small>HTML</small> or <small>PDF</small> ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To comment Pod
text, use the &quot;=for&quot; and &quot;=begin&quot; /
&quot;=end&quot; Pod directives, aiming them at a (notional)
formatter called &quot;&quot;comment&quot;&quot;. A couple
of examples:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">=for comment
Using &quot;=for comment&quot; like this is good for short,
<br>
single&minus;paragraph comments. <br>
=begin comment <br>
If you need to comment out more than one paragraph, use a
<br>
=begin/=end block, like this. <br>
None of the text or markup in this whole example would be
visible to <br>
someone reading the documentation through normal means, so
it's <br>
great for leaving notes, explanations, or suggestions for
your <br>
fellow documentation writers. <br>
=end comment</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the
tradition of any good open-source project, you should make
free but judicious use of comments to leave in-line
&quot;meta-documentation&quot; as needed for other Perl
documentation writers (including your future self).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Perlfunc has
special rules</b> <br>
The &quot;perlfunc&quot; man page, an exhaustive reference
of every Perl built-in function, has a handful of formatting
rules not seen elsewhere in Perl&rsquo;s documentation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Software used
during Perl&rsquo;s build process (Pod::Functions) parses
this page according to certain rules, in order to build
separate man pages for each of Perl&rsquo;s functions, as
well as achieve other indexing effects. As such,
contributors to perlfunc must know about and adhere to its
particular rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most of the
perfunc man page comprises a single list, found under the
header &quot;Alphabetical Listing of Perl Functions&quot;.
Each function reference is an entry on that list, made of
three parts, in order:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A list of &quot;=item&quot;
lines which each demonstrate, in template format, a way to
call this function. One line should exist for every
combination of arguments that the function accepts
(including no arguments at all, if applicable).</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If modern best
practices prefer certain ways to invoke the function over
others, then those ways should lead the list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The first item
of the list should be immediately followed by one or more
&quot;X&lt;...&gt;&quot; terms listing index-worthy topics;
if nothing else, then the name of the function, with no
arguments.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="83%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">A &quot;=for&quot; line,
directed at &quot;Pod::Functions&quot;, containing a
one-line description of what the function does. This is
written as a phrase, led with an imperative verb, with
neither leading capitalization nor ending punctuation.

&quot;change a filename&quot;.</p></td></tr>

functions that need their text divided into subsections

<a name="TONE AND STYLE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Apply one of
the four documentation modes</b> <br>
Aside from &quot;meta&quot; documentation such as
&quot;perlhist&quot; or &quot;perlartistic&quot;, each of
Perl&rsquo;s man pages should conform to one of the four
documentation &quot;modes&quot; suggested by <i>The
Documentation System</i> by Daniele Procida
&lt;https://documentation.divio.com&gt;. These include
tutorials, cookbooks, explainers, and references--terms that
we define in further detail below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Each mode of
documentation speaks to a different audience--not just
people of different backgrounds and skill levels, but
individual readers whose needs from language documentation
can shift depending upon context. For example, a programmer
with plenty of time to learn a new concept about Perl can
ease into a tutorial about it, and later expand their
knowledge further by studying an explainer. Later, that same
programmer, wading knee-deep in live code and needing only
to look up some function&rsquo;s exact syntax, will want to
reach for a reference page instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
documentation must strive to meet these different
situational expectations by limiting each man page to a
single mode. This helps writers ensure they provide readers
with the documentation needed or expected, despite
ever-evolving situations.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Tutorial</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A tutorial man
page focuses on <b>learning</b>, ideally by <i>doing</i>. It
presents the reader with small, interesting examples that
allow them to follow along themselves using their own Perl
interpreter. The tutorial inspires comprehension by letting
its readers immediately experience (and experiment on) the
concept in question. Examples include &quot;perlxstut&quot;,
&quot;perlpacktut&quot;, and &quot;perlretut&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tutorial man
pages must strive for a welcoming and reassuring tone from
their outset; they may very well be the first things that a
newcomer to Perl reads, playing a significant role in
whether they choose to stick around. Even an experienced
programmer can benefit from the sense of courage imparted by
a strong tutorial about a more advanced topic. After
completing a tutorial, a reader should feel like
they&rsquo;ve been led from zero knowledge of its topic to
having an invigorating spark of basic understanding, excited
to learn more and experiment further.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tutorials can
certainly use real-world examples when that helps make for
clear, relatable demonstrations, so long as they keep the
focus on teaching--more practical problem-solving should be
left to the realm of cookbooks (as described below).
Tutorials also needn&rsquo;t concern themselves with
explanations into why or how things work beneath the
surface, or explorations of alternate syntaxes and
solutions; these are better handled by explainers and
reference pages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Cookbook</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A cookbook man
page focuses on <b>results</b>. Just like its name suggests,
it presents succinct, step-by-step solutions to a variety of
real-world problems around some topic. A cookbook&rsquo;s
code examples serve less to enlighten and more to provide
quick, paste-ready solutions that the reader can apply
immediately to the situation facing them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A Perl cookbook
demonstrates ways that all the tools and techniques
explained elsewhere can work together in order to achieve
practical results. Any explanation deeper than that belongs
in explainers and reference pages, instead. (Certainly, a
cookbook can cross-reference other man pages in order to
satisfy the curiosity of readers who, with their immediate
problems solved, wish to learn more.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The most
prominent cookbook pages that ship with Perl itself are its
many <small>FAQ</small> pages, in particular
&quot;perlfaq4&quot; and up, which provide short solutions
to practical questions in question-and-answer style.
&quot;perlunicook&quot; shows another example, containing a
bevy of practical code snippets for a variety of
internationally minded text manipulations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">(An aside:
<i>The Documentation System</i> calls this mode
&quot;how-to&quot;, but Perl&rsquo;s history of creative
cuisine prefers the more kitchen-ready term that we employ
here.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Reference</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A reference
page focuses on <b>description</b>. Austere, uniform, and
succinct, reference pages--often arranged into a whole
section of mutually similar subpages--lend themselves well
to &quot;random access&quot; by a reader who knows precisely
what knowledge they need, requiring only the minimum amount
of information before returning to the task at hand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
own best example of a reference work is
&quot;perlfunc&quot;, the sprawling man page that details
the operation of every function built into Perl, with each
function&rsquo;s documentation presenting the same kinds of
information in the same order as every other. For an example
of a shorter reference on a single topic, look at
&quot;perlreref&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Module
documentation--including that of all the modules listed in
&quot;perlmodlib&quot;&minus;&minus;also counts as
reference. They follow precepts similar to those laid down
by the &quot;perlpodstyle&quot; man page, such as opening
with an example-laden &quot; <small>SYNOPSIS&quot;</small>
section, or featuring a &quot; <small>METHODS&quot;</small>
section that succinctly lists and defines an object-oriented
module&rsquo;s public interface.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Explainer</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Explainer pages
focus on <b>discussion</b>. Each explainer dives as deep as
needed into some Perl-relevant topic, taking all the time
and space needed to give the reader a thorough understanding
of it. Explainers mean to impart knowledge through study.
They don&rsquo;t assume that the student has a Perl
interpreter fired up and hungry for immediate examples (as
with a tutorial), or specific Perl problems that they need
quick answers for (which cookbooks and reference pages can
help with).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Outside of its
reference pages, most of Perl&rsquo;s manual belongs to this
mode. This includes the majority of the man pages whose
names start with &quot;&quot;perl&quot;&quot;. A fine
example is &quot;perlsyn&quot;, the Perl Syntax page, which
explores the whys and wherefores of Perl&rsquo;s unique
syntax in a wide-ranging discussion laden with many
references to the language&rsquo;s history, culture, and
driving philosophies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
explainer pages give authors a chance to explore
Perl&rsquo;s penchant for <small>TMTOWTDI</small> ,
illustrating alternate and even obscure ways to use the
language feature under discussion. However, as the remainder
of this guide discusses, the ideal Perl documentation
manages to deliver its message clearly and concisely, and
not confuse mere wordiness for completeness.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Further
notes on documentation modes</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Keep in mind
that the purpose of this categorization is not to dictate
content--a very thorough explainer might contain short
reference sections of its own, for example, or a reference
page about a very complex function might resemble an
explainer in places (e.g. &quot;open&quot;). Rather, it
makes sure that the authors and contributors of any given
man page agree on what sort of audience that page
addresses.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a new or
otherwise uncategorized man page presents itself as
resistant to fitting into only one of the four modes,
consider breaking it up into separate pages. That may mean
creating a new &quot;&quot;perl[...]&quot;&quot; man page,
or (in the case of module documentation) making new packages
underneath that module&rsquo;s namespace that serve only to
hold additional documentation. For instance,
&quot;Example::Module&quot;&rsquo;s reference documentation
might include a see-also link to
&quot;Example::Module::Cookbook&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
several man pages about Unicode--comprising a short
tutorial, a thorough explainer, a cookbook, and a
FAQ--provide a fine example of spreading a complicated topic
across several man pages with different and clearly
indicated purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Assume
readers&rsquo; intelligence, but not their knowledge</b>
<br>
Perl has grown a great deal from its humble beginnings as a
tool for people already well versed in C programming and
various Unix utilities. Today, a person learning Perl might
come from any social or technological background, with a
range of possible motivations stretching far beyond system
administration.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
core documentation must recognize this by making as few
assumptions as possible about the reader&rsquo;s prior
knowledge. While you should assume that readers of
Perl&rsquo;s documentation are smart, curious, and eager to
learn, you should not confuse this for pre-existing
knowledge about any other technology, or even programming in
general--especially in tutorial or introductory
material.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Keep
Perl&rsquo;s documentation about Perl</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Outside of
pages tasked specifically with exploring Perl&rsquo;s
relationship with other programming languages, the
documentation should keep the focus on Perl. Avoid drawing
analogies to other technologies that the reader may not have
familiarity with.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
when documenting one of Perl&rsquo;s built-in functions,
write as if the reader is now learning about that function
for the first time, in any programming language.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Choosing to
instead compare it to an equivalent or underlying C function
will probably not illuminate much understanding in a
contemporary reader. Worse, this can risk leaving readers
unfamiliar with C feeling locked out from fully
understanding of the topic--to say nothing of readers new to
computer programming altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If, however,
that function&rsquo;s ties to its C roots can lead to deeper
understanding with practical applications for a Perl
programmer, you may mention that link after its more
immediately useful documentation. Otherwise, omit this
information entirely, leaving it for other documentation or
external articles more concerned with examining Perl&rsquo;s
underlying implementation details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Deploy
jargon when needed, but define it as well</i></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Domain-specific
jargon has its place, especially within documentation.
However, if a man page makes use of jargon that a typical
reader might not already know, then that page should make an
effort to define the term in question early&minus;on--either
explicitly, or via cross reference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
Perl loves working with filehandles, and as such that word
appears throughout its documentation. A new Perl programmer
arriving at a man page for the first time is quite likely to
have no idea what a &quot;filehandle&quot; is, though. Any
Perl man page mentioning filehandles should, at the very
least, hyperlink that term to an explanation elsewhere in
Perl&rsquo;s documentation. If appropriate--for example, in
the lead-in to &quot;open&quot; function&rsquo;s detailed
reference&minus;&minus;it can also include a very short
in-place definition of the concept for the reader&rsquo;s
convenience.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Use
meaningful variable and symbol names in examples</b> <br>
When quickly sketching out examples, English-speaking
programmers have a long tradition of using short nonsense
words as placeholders for variables and other symbols--such
as the venerable &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, and
&quot;baz&quot;. Example code found in a programming
language&rsquo;s official, permanent documentation, however,
can and should make an effort to provide a little more
clarity through specificity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whenever
possible, code examples should give variables, classes, and
other programmer-defined symbols names that clearly
demonstrate their function and their relationship to one
another. For example, if an example requires that one class
show an &quot;is-a&quot; relationship with another, consider
naming them something like &quot;Apple&quot; and
&quot;Fruit&quot;, rather than &quot;Foo&quot; and
&quot;Bar&quot;. Similarly, sample code creating an instance
of that class would do better to name it $apple, rather than
$baz.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Even the
simplest examples benefit from clear language using concrete
words. Prefer a construct like &quot;for my $item (@items) {
... }&quot; over &quot;for my $blah (@blah) { ...
}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Write in
English, but not just for English-speakers</b> <br>
While this style guide does specify American English as the
documentation&rsquo;s language for the sake of internal
consistency, authors should avoid cultural or idiomatic
references available only to English-speaking Americans (or
any other specific culture or society). As much as possible,
the language employed by Perl&rsquo;s core documentation
should strive towards cultural universality, if not
neutrality. Regional turns of phrase, examples drawing on
popular-culture knowledge, and other rhetorical techniques
of that nature should appear sparingly, if at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Authors should
feel free to let more freewheeling language flourish in
&quot;second-order&quot; documentation about Perl, like
books, blog entries, and magazine articles, published
elsewhere and with a narrower readership in mind. But
Perl&rsquo;s own docs should use language as accessible and
welcoming to as wide an audience as possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Omit
placeholder text or commentary</b> <br>
Placeholder text does not belong in the documentation that
ships with Perl. No section header should be followed by
text reading only &quot;Watch this space&quot;, &quot;To be
included later&quot;, or the like. While Perl&rsquo;s source
files may shift and alter as much as any other actively
maintained technology, each released iteration of its
technology should feel complete and self-contained, with no
such future promises or other loose ends visible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Take advantage
of Perl&rsquo;s regular release cycle. Instead of cluttering
the docs with flags promising more information later--the
presence of which do not help readers at all today--the
documentation&rsquo;s maintenance team should treat any
known documentation absences as an issue to address like any
other in the Perl project. Let Perl&rsquo;s contributors,
testers, and release engineers address that need, and resist
the temptation to insert apologies, which have all the
utility in documentation as undeleted debug messages do in
production code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Apply
section-breaks and examples generously</b> <br>
No matter how accessible their tone, the sight of monolithic
blocks of text in technical documentation can present a
will-weakening challenge for the reader. Authors can improve
this situation through breaking long passages up into
subsections with short, meaningful headers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since every
section-header in Pod also acts as a potential end-point for
a cross-reference (made via Pod&rsquo;s
&quot;L&lt;...&gt;&quot; syntax), putting plenty of
subsections in your documentation lets other man pages more
precisely link to a particular topic. This creates
hyperlinks directly to the most appropriate section rather
than to the whole page in general, and helps create a more
cohesive sense of a rich, consistent, and interrelated
manual for readers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Among the four
documentation modes, sections belong more naturally in
tutorials and explainers. The step-by-step instructions of
cookbooks, or the austere definitions of reference pages,
usually have no room for them. But authors can always make
exceptions for unusually complex concepts that require
further breakdown for clarity&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Example code,
on the other hand, can be a welcome addition to any mode of
documentation. Code blocks help break up a man page
visually, reassuring the reader that no matter how deep the
textual explanation gets, they are never far from another
practical example showing how it all comes together using a
small, easy-to-read snippet of tested Perl code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Lead with
common cases and best practices</b> <br>
Perl famously gives programmers more than one way to do
things. Like any other long-lived programming language, Perl
has also built up a large, community-held notion of best
practices, blessing some ways to do things as better than
others, usually for the sake of more maintainable code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Show the
better ways first</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whenever it
needs to show the rules for a technique which Perl provides
many avenues for, the documentation should always lead with
best practices. And when discussing some part of the Perl
toolkit with many applications, the docs should begin with a
demonstration of its application to the most common
cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;open&quot; function, for example, has myriad potential
uses within Perl programs, but <i>most of the time</i>
programmers--and especially those new to Perl--turn to this
reference because they simply wish to open a file for
reading or writing. For this reason,
&quot;open&quot;&rsquo;s documentation begins there, and
only descends into the function&rsquo;s more obscure uses
after thoroughly documenting and demonstrating how it works
in the common case. Furthermore, while engaging in this
demonstration, the &quot;open&quot; documentation does not
burden the reader right away with detailed explanations
about calling &quot;open&quot; via any route other than the
best-practice, three-argument style.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Show the
lesser ways when needed</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Sometimes,
thoroughness demands documentation of deprecated techniques.
For example, a certain Perl function might have an alternate
syntax now considered outmoded and no longer best-practice,
but which a maintainer of a legacy project might quite
reasonably encounter when exploring old code. In this case,
these features deserve documentation, but couched in clarity
that modern Perl avoids such structures, and does not
recommend their use in new projects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another way to
look at this philosophy (and one borrowed from our friends
&lt;https://devguide.python.org/documenting/#affirmative-tone&gt;
on Python&rsquo;s documentation team) involves writing while
sympathizing with a programmer new to Perl, who may feel
uncertain about learning a complex concept. By leading that
concept&rsquo;s main documentation with clear, positive
examples, we can immediately give these readers a simple and
true picture of how it works in Perl, and boost their own
confidence to start making use of this new knowledge.
Certainly we should include alternate routes and admonitions
as reasonably required, but we needn&rsquo;t emphasize them.
Trust the reader to understand the basics quickly, and to
keep reading for a deeper understanding if they feel so
driven.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Document
Perl&rsquo;s present</b> <br>
Perl&rsquo;s documentation should stay focused on
Perl&rsquo;s present behavior, with a nod to future
directions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Recount the
past only when necessary</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When some Perl
feature changes its behavior, documentation about that
feature should change too, and just as definitively. The
docs have no obligation to keep descriptions of past
behavior hanging around, even if attaching clauses like
&quot;Prior to version 5.10, [...]&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
Perl&rsquo;s core documentation is part of Perl&rsquo;s
source distribution, it enjoys the same benefits of
versioning and version-control as the source code of Perl
itself. Take advantage of this, and update the text boldly
when needed. Perl&rsquo;s history remains safe, even when
you delete or replace outdated information from the current
version&rsquo;s docs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl&rsquo;s
docs can acknowledge or discuss former behavior when
warranted, including notes that some feature appeared in the
language as of some specific version number. Authors should
consider applying principles similar to those for deprecated
techniques, as described above: make the information
present, but not prominent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, keep
the past in the past. A manual uncluttered with outdated
instruction stays more succinct and relevant.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Describe the
uncertain future with care</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl features
marked as &quot;experimental&quot;&minus;&minus;those that
generate warnings when used in code not invoking the
&quot;experimental&quot; pragma--deserve documentation, but
only in certain contexts, and even then with caveats. These
features represent possible new directions for Perl, but
they have unstable interfaces and uncertain future
presence.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
documentation should take both implications of
&quot;experimental&quot; literally. It should not discourage
these features&rsquo; use by programmers who wish to try out
new features in projects that can risk their inherent
instability; this experimentation can help Perl grow and
improve. By the same token, the docs should downplay these
features&rsquo; use in just about every other context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Introductory or
overview material should omit coverage of experimental
features altogether.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">More thorough
reference materials or explanatory articles can include
experimental features, but needs to clearly mark them as
such, and not treat them with the same prominence as
Perl&rsquo;s stable features. Using unstable features seldom
coincides with best practices, and documentation that puts
best practices first should reflect this.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
documentation speaks with one voice</b> <br>
Even though it comes from many hands and minds,
criss-crossing through the many years of Perl&rsquo;s
lifetime, the language&rsquo;s documentation should speak
with a single, consistent voice. With few exceptions, the
docs should avoid explicit first-person-singular statements,
or similar self-reference to any individual&rsquo;s
contributor&rsquo;s philosophies or experiences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl did begin
life as a deeply personal expression by a single individual,
and this famously carried through the first revisions of its
documentation as well. Today, Perl&rsquo;s community
understands that the language&rsquo;s continued development
and support comes from many people working in concert,
rather than any one person&rsquo;s vision or effort. Its
documentation should not pretend otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
documentation should, however, carry forward the best
tradition that Larry Wall set forth in the language&rsquo;s
earliest days: Write both economically and with a humble,
subtle wit, resulting in a technical manual that mixes
concision with a friendly approachability. It avoids the
dryness that one might expect from technical documentation,
while not leaning so hard into overt comedy as to distract
and confuse from the nonetheless-technical topics at
hand.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Like the best
written works, Perl&rsquo;s documentation has a soul. Get
familiar with it as a reader to internalize its voice, and
then find your own way to express it in your own
contributions. Writing clearly, succinctly, and with
knowledge of your audience&rsquo;s expectations will get you
most of the way there, in the meantime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Every line in
the docs--whether English sentence or Perl statement--should
serve the purpose of bringing understanding to the reader.
Should a sentence exist mainly to make a wry joke that
doesn&rsquo;t further the reader&rsquo;s knowledge of Perl,
set it aside, and consider recasting it into a personal blog
post or other article instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Write with a
light heart, and a miserly hand.</p>

<h2>INDEX OF PREFERRED TERMS
<a name="INDEX OF PREFERRED TERMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As noted above,
this guide &quot;inherits&quot; all the preferred terms
listed in the Chicago Manual of Style, 17th edition, and
adds the following terms of particular interest to Perl
documentation. <br>
built-in function</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Not &quot;builtin&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Darwin</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See macOS.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">macOS</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use this term for Apple&rsquo;s
operating system instead of &quot;Mac <small>OS
X&quot;</small> or variants thereof.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This term is
also preferable to &quot;Darwin&quot;, unless one needs to
refer to macOS&rsquo;s Unix layer specifically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">man page</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">One unit of Unix-style
documentation. Not &quot;manpage&quot;. Preferable to
&quot;manual page&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Perl; perl</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The name of the programming
language is Perl, with a leading capital &quot;P&quot;, and
the remainder in lowercase. (Never &quot;
<small>PERL&quot;.</small> )</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The interpreter
program that reads and executes Perl code is named
&quot;&quot;perl&quot;&quot;, in lowercase and in monospace
(as with any other command name).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Generally,
unless you are specifically writing about the command-line
&quot;perl&quot; program (as, for example,
&quot;perlrun&quot; does), use &quot;Perl&quot; instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Perl 5</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Documentation need not follow
Perl&rsquo;s name with a &quot;5&quot;, or any other number,
except during discussions of Perl&rsquo;s history, future
plans, or explicit comparisons between major Perl
versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Before 2019,
specifying &quot;Perl 5&quot; was sometimes needed to
distinguish the language from Perl 6. With the
latter&rsquo;s renaming to &quot;Raku&quot;, this practice
became unnecessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Perl 6</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See Raku.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Perl 5 Porters, the; porters,
the; p5p</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The full name of the team
responsible for Perl&rsquo;s ongoing maintenance and
development is &quot;the Perl 5 Porters&quot;, and this
sobriquet should be spelled out in the first mention within
any one document. It may thereafter call the team &quot;the
porters&quot; or &quot;p5p&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Not &quot;Perl5
Porters&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">program</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The most general descriptor for
a stand-alone work made out of executable Perl code.
Synonymous with, and preferable to, &quot;script&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Raku</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perl&rsquo;s &quot;sister
language&quot;, whose homepage is
&lt;https://raku.org&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Previously
known as &quot;Perl 6&quot;. In 2019, its design team
renamed the language to better reflect its identity as a
project independent from Perl. As such, Perl&rsquo;s
documentation should always refer to this language as
&quot;Raku&quot; and not &quot;Perl 6&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">script</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">See program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">semicolon</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perl code&rsquo;s frequently
overlooked punctuation mark. Not &quot;semi-colon&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Unix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Not &quot;
<small>UNIX&quot;,</small> &quot;*nix&quot;, or
&quot;Un*x&quot;. Applicable to both the original operating
system from the 1970s as well as all its conceptual
descendants. You may simply write &quot;Unix&quot; and not
&quot;a Unix-like operating system&quot; when referring to a
Unix-like operating system.</p>
