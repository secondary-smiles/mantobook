<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">make &minus;
GNU Make utility to maintain groups of programs</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b>
[<i>OPTION</i>]... [<i>TARGET</i>]...</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>make</i>
utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large
program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to
recompile them. The manual describes the GNU implementation
of <b>make</b>, which was written by Richard Stallman and
Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by Paul Smith.
Our examples show C programs, since they are very common,
but you can use <b>make</b> with any programming language
whose compiler can be run with a shell command. In fact,
<b>make</b> is not limited to programs. You can use it to
describe any task where some files must be updated
automatically from others whenever the others change.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To prepare to
use <b>make</b>, you must write a file called the
<i>makefile</i> that describes the relationships among files
in your program, and provides commands for updating each
file. In a program, typically the executable file is updated
from object files, which are in turn made by compiling
source files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Once a suitable
makefile exists, each time you change some source files,
this simple shell command:</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">suffices to
perform all necessary recompilations. The <b>make</b>
program uses the makefile description and the
last-modification times of the files to decide which of the
files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues
the commands recorded in the makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b>
executes commands in the <i>makefile</i> to update one or
more <i>targets</i>, where <i>target</i> is typically a
program. If no <b>&minus;f</b> option is present,
<b>make</b> will look for the makefiles <i>GNUmakefile</i>,
<i>makefile</i>, and <i>Makefile</i>, in that order.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally you
should call your makefile either <i>makefile</i> or
<i>Makefile</i>. (We recommend <i>Makefile</i> because it
appears prominently near the beginning of a directory
listing, right near other important files such as
<i>README</i>.) The first name checked, <i>GNUmakefile</i>,
is not recommended for most makefiles. You should use this
name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU Make,
and will not be understood by other versions of <b>make</b>.
If <i>makefile</i> is &rsquo;&minus;&rsquo;, the standard
input is read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>make</b>
updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that
have been modified since the target was last modified, or if
the target does not exist.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;b</b>,
<b>&minus;m</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">These options are ignored for
compatibility with other versions of <b>make</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;B</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;always&minus;make</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Unconditionally make all
targets.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;C</b> <i>dir</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;directory</b>=<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Change to directory <i>dir</i>
before reading the makefiles or doing anything else. If
multiple <b>&minus;C</b> options are specified, each is
interpreted relative to the previous one: <b>&minus;C</b> /
<b>&minus;C</b> etc is equivalent to <b>&minus;C</b> /etc.
This is typically used with recursive invocations of
<b>make</b>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>&minus;d</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">


<p>Print debugging information in addition to normal
processing. The debugging information says which files are
being considered for remaking, which file-times are being
compared and with what results, which files actually need to
be remade, which implicit rules are considered and which are
applied---everything interesting about how <b>make</b>
decides what to do.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;debug</b><i>[=FLAGS]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print debugging information in
addition to normal processing. If the <i>FLAGS</i> are
omitted, then the behavior is the same as if <b>&minus;d</b>
was specified. <i>FLAGS</i> may be any or all of the
following names, comma- or space-separated. Only the first
character is significant: the rest may be omitted:
<i>all</i> for all debugging output (same as using
<b>&minus;d</b>), <i>basic</i> for basic debugging,
<i>verbose</i> for more verbose basic debugging,
<i>implicit</i> for showing implicit rule search operations,
<i>jobs</i> for details on invocation of commands,
<i>makefile</i> for debugging while remaking makefiles,
<i>print</i> shows all recipes that are run even if they are
silent, and <i>why</i> shows the reason <b>make</b> decided
to rebuild each target. Use <i>none</i> to disable all
previous debugging flags.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;e</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;environment&minus;overrides</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Give variables taken from the
environment precedence over variables from makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;E</b> <i>string</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;eval</b> <i>string</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Interpret <i>string</i> using
the <b>eval</b> function, before parsing any makefiles.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;f</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;file</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;makefile</b>=<i>FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use <i>file</i> as a
makefile.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;i</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;errors</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Ignore all errors in commands
executed to remake files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;I</b> <i>dir</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;include&minus;dir</b>=<i>dir</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies a directory
<i>dir</i> to search for included makefiles. If several
<b>&minus;I</b> options are used to specify several
directories, the directories are searched in the order
specified. Unlike the arguments to other flags of
<b>make</b>, directories given with <b>&minus;I</b> flags
may come directly after the flag: <b>&minus;I</b><i>dir</i>
is allowed, as well as <b>&minus;I</b> <i>dir</i>. This
syntax is allowed for compatibility with the C
preprocessor&rsquo;s <b>&minus;I</b> flag.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;j</b> [<i>jobs</i>],
<b>&minus;&minus;jobs</b>[=<i>jobs</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies the number of
<i>jobs</i> (commands) to run simultaneously. If there is
more than one <b>&minus;j</b> option, the last one is
effective. If the <b>&minus;j</b> option is given without an
argument, <b>make</b> will not limit the number of jobs that
can run simultaneously.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;-jobserver-style=</b><i>style</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">The style of jobserver to use.
The <i>style</i> may be one of <b>fifo</b>, <b>pipe</b>, or
<b>sem</b> (Windows only).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;k</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;keep&minus;going</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Continue as much as possible
after an error. While the target that failed, and those that
depend on it, cannot be remade, the other dependencies of
these targets can be processed all the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;l</b> [<i>load</i>],
<b>&minus;&minus;load&minus;average</b>[=<i>load</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Specifies that no new jobs
(commands) should be started if there are others jobs
running and the load average is at least <i>load</i> (a
floating-point number). With no argument, removes a previous
load limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;L</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;check&minus;symlink&minus;times</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use the latest mtime between
symlinks and target.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;n</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;just&minus;print</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;dry&minus;run</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;recon</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the commands that would
be executed, but do not execute them (except in certain
circumstances).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;o</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;old&minus;file</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;assume&minus;old</b>=<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Do not remake the file
<i>file</i> even if it is older than its dependencies, and
do not remake anything on account of changes in <i>file</i>.
Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules
are ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;O</b>[<i>type</i>],
<b>&minus;&minus;output&minus;sync</b>[=<i>type</i>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">When running multiple jobs in
parallel with <b>-j</b>, ensure the output of each job is
collected together rather than interspersed with output from
other jobs. If <i>type</i> is not specified or is
<b>target</b> the output from the entire recipe for each
target is grouped together. If <i>type</i> is <b>line</b>
the output from each command line within a recipe is grouped
together. If <i>type</i> is <b>recurse</b> output from an
entire recursive make is grouped together. If <i>type</i> is
<b>none</b> output synchronization is disabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;p</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;print&minus;data&minus;base</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the data base (rules and
variable values) that results from reading the makefiles;
then execute as usual or as otherwise specified. This also
prints the version information given by the <b>&minus;v</b>
switch (see below). To print the data base without trying to
remake any files, use <i>make &minus;p
&minus;f/dev/null</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;q</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;question</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">&lsquo;&lsquo;Question
mode&rsquo;&rsquo;. Do not run any commands, or print
anything; just return an exit status that is zero if the
specified targets are already up to date, nonzero
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;r</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;builtin&minus;rules</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Eliminate use of the
built&minus;in implicit rules. Also clear out the default
list of suffixes for suffix rules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;R</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;builtin&minus;variables</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Don&rsquo;t define any
built&minus;in variables.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;s</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;silent</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Silent operation; do not print
the commands as they are executed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;silent</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Cancel the effect of the
<b>&minus;s</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;S</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;keep&minus;going</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;stop</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Cancel the effect of the
<b>&minus;k</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;t</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;touch</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Touch files (mark them up to
date without really changing them) instead of running their
commands. This is used to pretend that the commands were
done, in order to fool future invocations of
<b>make</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;trace</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Information about the
disposition of each target is printed (why the target is
being rebuilt and what commands are run to rebuild it).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;v</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print the version of the
<b>make</b> program plus a copyright, a list of authors and
a notice that there is no warranty.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;w</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;print&minus;directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Print a message containing the
working directory before and after other processing. This
may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated
nests of recursive <b>make</b> commands.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;no&minus;print&minus;directory</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Turn off <b>&minus;w</b>, even
if it was turned on implicitly.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;shuffle</b><i>[=MODE]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Enable shuffling of goal and
prerequisite ordering. <i>MODE</i> is one of <i>none</i> to
disable shuffle mode, <i>random</i> to shuffle prerequisites
in random order, <i>reverse</i> to consider prerequisites in
reverse order, or an integer <i>&lt;seed&gt;</i> which
enables <i>random</i> mode with a specific <i>seed</i>
value. If <i>MODE</i> is omitted the default is
<i>random</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;W</b> <i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;what&minus;if</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;new&minus;file</b>=<i>file</i>,
<b>&minus;&minus;assume&minus;new</b>=<i>file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Pretend that the target
<i>file</i> has just been modified. When used with the
<b>&minus;n</b> flag, this shows you what would happen if
you were to modify that file. Without <b>&minus;n</b>, it is
almost the same as running a <i>touch</i> command on the
given file before running <b>make</b>, except that the
modification time is changed only in the imagination of
<b>make</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;warn&minus;undefined&minus;variables</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:18%;">Warn when an undefined variable
is referenced.</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">GNU Make exits
with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully
parsed and no targets that were built failed. A status of
one will be returned if the <b>&minus;q</b> flag was used
and <b>make</b> determines that a target needs to be
rebuilt. A status of two will be returned if any errors were
encountered.</p>

<h2>SEE ALSO
<a name="SEE ALSO"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The full
documentation for <b>make</b> is maintained as a Texinfo
