<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl5100delta
&minus; what is new for perl 5.10.0</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes the differences between the 5.8.8 release and the
5.10.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many of the bug
fixes in 5.10.0 were already seen in the 5.8.X maintenance
releases; they are not duplicated here and are documented in
the set of man pages named perl58[1&minus;8]?delta.</p>

<h2>Core Enhancements
<a name="Core Enhancements"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
&quot;feature&quot; pragma</b> <br>
The &quot;feature&quot; pragma is used to enable new syntax
that would break Perl&rsquo;s backwards-compatibility with
older releases of the language. It&rsquo;s a lexical pragma,
like &quot;strict&quot; or &quot;warnings&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently the
following new features are available: &quot;switch&quot;
(adds a switch statement), &quot;say&quot; (adds a
&quot;say&quot; built-in function), and &quot;state&quot;
(adds a &quot;state&quot; keyword for declaring
&quot;static&quot; variables). Those features are described
in their own sections of this document.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;feature&quot; pragma is also implicitly loaded when
you require a minimal perl version (with the &quot;use
VERSION&quot; construct) greater than, or equal to, 5.9.5.
See feature for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New &minus;E
command-line switch <br>
&minus;E</b> is equivalent to <b>&minus;e</b>, but it
implicitly enables all optional features (like &quot;use
feature &quot;:5.10&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Defined-or
operator</b> <br>
A new operator &quot;//&quot; (defined-or) has been
implemented. The following expression:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$a // $b</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">is merely
equivalent to</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">defined $a ? $a
: $b</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and the
statement</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$c //= $d;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">can now be used
instead of</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$c = $d unless
defined $c;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;//&quot; operator has the same precedence and
associativity as &quot;||&quot;. Special care has been taken
to ensure that this operator Do What You Mean while not
breaking old code, but some edge cases involving the empty
regular expression may now parse differently. See perlop for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Switch and
Smart Match operator</b> <br>
Perl 5 now has a switch statement. It&rsquo;s available when
&quot;use feature 'switch'&quot; is in effect. This feature
introduces three new keywords, &quot;given&quot;,
&quot;when&quot;, and &quot;default&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">given ($foo) {
<br>
when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1; } <br>
when (/^def/) { $def = 1; } <br>
when (/^xyz/) { $xyz = 1; } <br>
default { $nothing = 1; } <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A more complete
description of how Perl matches the switch variable against
the &quot;when&quot; conditions is given in &quot;Switch
statements&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This kind of
match is called <i>smart match</i>, and it&rsquo;s also
possible to use it outside of switch statements, via the new
&quot;~~&quot; operator. See &quot;Smart matching in
detail&quot; in perlsyn.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This feature
was contributed by Robin Houston.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Regular
expressions</b> <br>
Recursive Patterns</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">It is now possible to write
recursive patterns without using the &quot;(??{})&quot;
construct. This new way is more efficient, and in many cases
easier to read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Each capturing
parenthesis can now be treated as an independent pattern
that can be entered by using the &quot;(?PARNO)&quot; syntax
(&quot;PARNO&quot; standing for &quot;parenthesis
number&quot;). For example, the following pattern will match
nested balanced angle brackets:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">/ <br>
^ # start of line <br>
( # start capture buffer 1 <br>
&lt; # match an opening angle bracket <br>
(?: # match one of: <br>
(?&gt; # don't backtrack over the inside of this group <br>
[^&lt;&gt;]+ # one or more non angle brackets <br>
) # end non backtracking group <br>
| # ... or ... <br>
(?1) # recurse to bracket 1 and try it again <br>
)* # 0 or more times. <br>
&gt; # match a closing angle bracket <br>
) # end capture buffer one <br>
$ # end of line <br>
/x</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><small>PCRE</small>
users should note that Perl&rsquo;s recursive regex feature
allows backtracking into a recursed pattern, whereas in
<small>PCRE</small> the recursion is atomic or
&quot;possessive&quot; in nature. As in the example above,
you can add (?&gt;) to control this selectively. (Yves
Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Named Capture Buffers</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">It is now possible to name
capturing parenthesis in a pattern and refer to the captured
contents by name. The naming syntax is
&quot;(?&lt;NAME&gt;....)&quot;. It&rsquo;s possible to
backreference to a named buffer with the
&quot;\k&lt;NAME&gt;&quot; syntax. In code, the new magical
hashes &quot;%+&quot; and &quot;%&minus;&quot; can be used
to access the contents of the capture buffers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, to
replace all doubled chars with a single copy, one could
write</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">s/(?&lt;letter&gt;.)\k&lt;letter&gt;/$+{letter}/g</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Only buffers
with defined contents will be &quot;visible&quot; in the
&quot;%+&quot; hash, so it&rsquo;s possible to do something
like</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">foreach my
$name (keys %+) { <br>
print &quot;content of buffer '$name' is $+{$name}\n&quot;;
<br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
&quot;%&minus;&quot; hash is a bit more complete, since it
will contain array refs holding values from all capture
buffers similarly named, if there should be many of
them.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;%+&quot;
and &quot;%&minus;&quot; are implemented as tied hashes
through the new module
&quot;Tie::Hash::NamedCapture&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Users exposed
to the .NET regex engine will find that the perl
implementation differs in that the numerical ordering of the
buffers is sequential, and not &quot;unnamed first, then
named&quot;. Thus in the pattern</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">/(A)(?&lt;B&gt;B)(C)(?&lt;D&gt;D)/</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">$1 will be
&rsquo;A&rsquo;, $2 will be &rsquo;B&rsquo;, $3 will be
&rsquo;C&rsquo; and $4 will be &rsquo;D&rsquo; and not $1 is
&rsquo;A&rsquo;, $2 is &rsquo;C&rsquo; and $3 is
&rsquo;B&rsquo; and $4 is &rsquo;D&rsquo; that a .NET
programmer would expect. This is considered a feature.
:&minus;) (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Possessive Quantifiers</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perl now supports the
&quot;possessive quantifier&quot; syntax of the &quot;atomic
match&quot; pattern. Basically a possessive quantifier
matches as much as it can and never gives any back. Thus it
can be used to control backtracking. The syntax is similar
to non-greedy matching, except instead of using a
&rsquo;?&rsquo; as the modifier the &rsquo;+&rsquo; is used.
Thus &quot;?+&quot;, &quot;*+&quot;, &quot;++&quot;,
&quot;{min,max}+&quot; are now legal quantifiers. (Yves
Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Backtracking control verbs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The regex engine now supports a
number of special-purpose backtrack control verbs: (*THEN),
(*PRUNE), (*MARK), (*SKIP), (*COMMIT), (*FAIL) and
(*ACCEPT). See perlre for their descriptions. (Yves
Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Relative backreferences</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A new syntax &quot;\g{N}&quot;
or &quot;\gN&quot; where &quot;N&quot; is a decimal integer
allows a safer form of back-reference notation as well as
allowing relative backreferences. This should make it easier
to generate and embed patterns that contain backreferences.
See &quot;Capture buffers&quot; in perlre. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;\K&quot; escape</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The functionality of Jeff
Pinyan&rsquo;s module Regexp::Keep has been added to the
core. In regular expressions you can now use the special
escape &quot;\K&quot; as a way to do something like floating
length positive lookbehind. It is also useful in
substitutions like:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">s/(foo)bar/$1/g</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">that can now be
converted to</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">s/foo\Kbar//g</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">which is much
more efficient. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Vertical and horizontal
whitespace, and linebreak</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Regular expressions now
recognize the &quot;\v&quot; and &quot;\h&quot; escapes that
match vertical and horizontal whitespace, respectively.
&quot;\V&quot; and &quot;\H&quot; logically match their
complements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;\R&quot;
matches a generic linebreak, that is, vertical whitespace,
plus the multi-character sequence &quot;\x0D\x0A&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Optional pre-match and
post-match captures with the /p flag</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">There is a new flag
&quot;/p&quot; for regular expressions. Using this makes the
engine preserve a copy of the part of the matched string
before the matching substring to the new special variable
&quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;, the part after the matching
substring to &quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot;, and the matched
substring itself to &quot;${^MATCH}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Perl is still
able to store these substrings to the special variables
&quot;$`&quot;, &quot;$'&quot;, $&amp;, but using these
variables anywhere in the program adds a penalty to all
regular expression matches, whereas if you use the
&quot;/p&quot; flag and the new special variables instead,
you pay only for the regular expressions where the flag is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For more detail
on the new variables, see perlvar; for the use of the
regular expression flag, see perlop and perlre.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;say()&quot;
<br>
say()</b> is a new built-in, only available when &quot;use
feature 'say'&quot; is in effect, that is similar to
<b>print()</b>, but that implicitly appends a newline to the
printed string. See &quot;say&quot; in perlfunc. (Robin
Houston)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Lexical
$_</b> <br>
The default variable $_ can now be lexicalized, by declaring
it like any other lexical variable, with a simple</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">my $_;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The operations
that default on $_ will use the lexically-scoped version of
$_ when it exists, instead of the global $_.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a
&quot;map&quot; or a &quot;grep&quot; block, if $_ was
previously my&rsquo;ed, then the $_ inside the block is
lexical as well (and scoped to the block).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a scope
where $_ has been lexicalized, you can still have access to
the global version of $_ by using $::_, or, more simply, by
overriding the lexical declaration with &quot;our $_&quot;.
(Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
&quot;_&quot; prototype</b> <br>
A new prototype character has been added. &quot;_&quot; is
equivalent to &quot;$&quot; but defaults to $_ if the
corresponding argument isn&rsquo;t supplied (both
&quot;$&quot; and &quot;_&quot; denote a scalar). Due to the
optional nature of the argument, you can only use it at the
end of a prototype, or before a semicolon.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This has a
small incompatible consequence: the <b>prototype()</b>
function has been adjusted to return &quot;_&quot; for some
built-ins in appropriate cases (for example,
&quot;prototype('CORE::rmdir')&quot;). (Rafael
Garcia-Suarez)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>UNITCHECK</small>
blocks</b> <br>
&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;, a new special code block has been
introduced, in addition to &quot;BEGIN&quot;,
&quot;CHECK&quot;, &quot;INIT&quot; and &quot;END&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;CHECK&quot;
and &quot;INIT&quot; blocks, while useful for some
specialized purposes, are always executed at the transition
between the compilation and the execution of the main
program, and thus are useless whenever code is loaded at
runtime. On the other hand, &quot;UNITCHECK&quot; blocks are
executed just after the unit which defined them has been
compiled. See perlmod for more information. (Alex Gough)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New Pragma,
&quot;mro&quot;</b> <br>
A new pragma, &quot;mro&quot; (for Method Resolution Order)
has been added. It permits to switch, on a per-class basis,
the algorithm that perl uses to find inherited methods in
case of a multiple inheritance hierarchy. The default
<small>MRO</small> hasn&rsquo;t changed (
<small>DFS,</small> for Depth First Search). Another
<small>MRO</small> is available: the C3 algorithm. See mro
for more information. (Brandon Black)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that, due
to changes in the implementation of class hierarchy search,
code that used to undef the *ISA glob will most probably
break. Anyway, undef&rsquo;ing *ISA had the side-effect of
removing the magic on the @ISA array and should not have
been done in the first place. Also, the cache
*::ISA::CACHE:: no longer exists; to force reset the @ISA
cache, you now need to use the &quot;mro&quot;
<small>API,</small> or more simply to assign to @ISA (e.g.
with &quot;@ISA = @ISA&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>readdir()
may return a &quot;short filename&quot; on Windows</b> <br>
The <b>readdir()</b> function may return a &quot;short
filename&quot; when the long filename contains characters
outside the <small>ANSI</small> codepage. Similarly
<b>Cwd::cwd()</b> may return a short directory name, and
<b>glob()</b> may return short names as well. On the
<small>NTFS</small> file system these short names can always
be represented in the <small>ANSI</small> codepage. This
will not be true for all other file system drivers; e.g. the
<small>FAT</small> filesystem stores short filenames in the
<small>OEM</small> codepage, so some files on
<small>FAT</small> volumes remain inaccessible through the
<small>ANSI</small> APIs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly, $^X,
@INC, and $ENV{ <small>PATH</small> } are preprocessed at
startup to make sure all paths are valid in the
<small>ANSI</small> codepage (if possible).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>Win32::GetLongPathName()</b> function now returns the
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded correct long file name
instead of using replacement characters to force the name
into the <small>ANSI</small> codepage. The new
<b>Win32::GetANSIPathName()</b> function can be used to turn
a long pathname into a short one only if the long one cannot
be represented in the <small>ANSI</small> codepage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many other
functions in the &quot;Win32&quot; module have been improved
to accept <small>UTF&minus;8</small> encoded arguments.
Please see Win32 for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>readpipe()
is now overridable</b> <br>
The built-in function <b>readpipe()</b> is now overridable.
Overriding it permits also to override its operator
counterpart, &quot;qx//&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;``&quot;).
Moreover, it now defaults to $_ if no argument is provided.
(Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Default
argument for readline() <br>
readline()</b> now defaults to *ARGV if no argument is
provided. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>state()
variables</b> <br>
A new class of variables has been introduced. State
variables are similar to &quot;my&quot; variables, but are
declared with the &quot;state&quot; keyword in place of
&quot;my&quot;. They&rsquo;re visible only in their lexical
scope, but their value is persistent: unlike &quot;my&quot;
variables, they&rsquo;re not undefined at scope entry, but
retain their previous value. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Nicholas
Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To use state
variables, one needs to enable them by using</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use feature
'state';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or by using the
&quot;&minus;E&quot; command-line switch in one-liners. See
&quot;Persistent Private Variables&quot; in perlsub.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Stacked
filetest operators</b> <br>
As a new form of syntactic sugar, it&rsquo;s now possible to
stack up filetest operators. You can now write
&quot;&minus;f &minus;w &minus;x $file&quot; in a row to
mean &quot;&minus;x $file &amp;&amp; &minus;w _ &amp;&amp;
&minus;f _&quot;. See &quot;&minus;X&quot; in perlfunc.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>UNIVERSAL::DOES</small>
()</b> <br>
The &quot;UNIVERSAL&quot; class has a new method,
&quot;DOES()&quot;. It has been added to solve semantic
problems with the &quot;isa()&quot; method.
&quot;isa()&quot; checks for inheritance, while
&quot;DOES()&quot; has been designed to be overridden when
module authors use other types of relations between classes
(in addition to inheritance). (chromatic)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;$obj&minus;&gt; <small>DOES</small> (
<small>ROLE</small> )&quot; in <small>UNIVERSAL</small>
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Formats</b>
<br>
Formats were improved in several ways. A new field,
&quot;^*&quot;, can be used for variable-width,
one-line-at-a-time text. Null characters are now handled
correctly in picture lines. Using &quot;@#&quot; and
&quot;~~&quot; together will now produce a compile-time
error, as those format fields are incompatible. perlform has
been improved, and miscellaneous bugs fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Byte-order
modifiers for pack() and unpack()</b> <br>
There are two new byte-order modifiers, &quot;&gt;&quot;
(big-endian) and &quot;&lt;&quot; (little-endian), that can
be appended to most <b>pack()</b> and <b>unpack()</b>
template characters and groups to force a certain byte-order
for that type or group. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc and
perlpacktut for details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;no
VERSION&quot;</b> <br>
You can now use &quot;no&quot; followed by a version number
to specify that you want to use a version of perl older than
the specified one.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;chdir&quot;,
&quot;chmod&quot; and &quot;chown&quot; on filehandles</b>
<br>
&quot;chdir&quot;, &quot;chmod&quot; and &quot;chown&quot;
can now work on filehandles as well as filenames, if the
system supports respectively &quot;fchdir&quot;,
&quot;fchmod&quot; and &quot;fchown&quot;, thanks to a patch
provided by Gisle Aas.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>OS</small>
groups</b> <br>
$( and $) now return groups in the order where the
<small>OS</small> returns them, thanks to Gisle Aas. This
wasn&rsquo;t previously the case.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Recursive
sort subs</b> <br>
You can now use recursive subroutines with <b>sort()</b>,
thanks to Robin Houston.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Exceptions
in constant folding</b> <br>
The constant folding routine is now wrapped in an exception
handler, and if folding throws an exception (such as
attempting to evaluate 0/0), perl now retains the current
optree, rather than aborting the whole program. Without this
change, programs would not compile if they had expressions
that happened to generate exceptions, even though those
expressions were in code that could never be reached at
runtime. (Nicholas Clark, Dave Mitchell)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Source
filters in @INC</b> <br>
It&rsquo;s possible to enhance the mechanism of subroutine
hooks in @INC by adding a source filter on top of the
filehandle opened and returned by the hook. This feature was
planned a long time ago, but wasn&rsquo;t quite working
until now. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc for details.
(Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New internal
variables</b> <br>
&quot;${^RE_DEBUG_FLAGS}&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This variable controls what
debug flags are in effect for the regular expression engine
when running under &quot;use re &quot;debug&quot;&quot;. See
re for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This variable gives the native
status returned by the last pipe close, backtick command,
successful call to <b>wait()</b> or <b>waitpid()</b>, or
from the <b>system()</b> operator. See perlvar for details.
(Contributed by Gisle Aas.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Miscellaneous</b>
<br>
&quot;unpack()&quot; now defaults to unpacking the $_
variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;mkdir()&quot;
without arguments now defaults to $_.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The internal
dump output has been improved, so that non-printable
characters such as newline and backspace are output in
&quot;\x&quot; notation, rather than octal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;C</b> option can no longer be used on the
&quot;#!&quot; line. It wasn&rsquo;t working there anyway,
since the standard streams are already set up at this point
in the execution of the perl interpreter. You can use

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>MAD</small></b>
<small><br>
MAD,</small> which stands for <i>Miscellaneous Attribute
Decoration</i>, is a still-in-development work leading to a
Perl 5 to Perl 6 converter. To enable it, it&rsquo;s
necessary to pass the argument &quot;&minus;Dmad&quot; to
Configure. The obtained perl isn&rsquo;t binary compatible
with a regular perl 5.10, and has space and speed penalties;
moreover not all regression tests still pass with it. (Larry
Wall, Nicholas Clark)</p>

all processes in the same process group.)</p>

<h2>Incompatible Changes
<a name="Incompatible Changes"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Packing and
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> strings</b> <br>
The semantics of <b>pack()</b> and <b>unpack()</b> regarding
UTF&minus;8&minus;encoded data has been changed. Processing
is now by default character per character instead of byte
per byte on the underlying encoding. Notably, code that used
things like &quot;pack(&quot;a*&quot;, $string)&quot; to see
through the encoding of string will now simply get back the
original $string. Packed strings can also get upgraded
during processing when you store upgraded characters. You
can get the old behaviour by using &quot;use
bytes&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To be
consistent with <b>pack()</b>, the &quot;C0&quot; in
<b>unpack()</b> templates indicates that the data is to be
processed in character mode, i.e. character by character; on
the contrary, &quot;U0&quot; in <b>unpack()</b> indicates
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> mode, where the packed string is
processed in its UTF&minus;8&minus;encoded Unicode form on a
byte by byte basis. This is reversed with regard to perl
5.8.X, but now consistent between <b>pack()</b> and
<b>unpack()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Moreover,
&quot;C0&quot; and &quot;U0&quot; can also be used in
<b>pack()</b> templates to specify respectively character
and byte modes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;C0&quot;
and &quot;U0&quot; in the middle of a pack or unpack format
now switch to the specified encoding mode, honoring parens
grouping. Previously, parens were ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, there is
a new <b>pack()</b> character format, &quot;W&quot;, which
is intended to replace the old &quot;C&quot;. &quot;C&quot;
is kept for unsigned chars coded as bytes in the strings
internal representation. &quot;W&quot; represents unsigned
(logical) character values, which can be greater than 255.
It is therefore more robust when dealing with potentially
UTF&minus;8&minus;encoded data (as &quot;C&quot; will wrap
values outside the range 0..255, and not respect the string
encoding).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In practice,
that means that pack formats are now encoding-neutral,
except &quot;C&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For
consistency, &quot;A&quot; in <b>unpack()</b> format now
trims all Unicode whitespace from the end of the string.
Before perl 5.9.2, it used to strip only the classical
<small>ASCII</small> space characters.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Byte/character
count feature in unpack()</b> <br>
A new <b>unpack()</b> template character, &quot;.&quot;,
returns the number of bytes or characters (depending on the
selected encoding mode, see above) read so far.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The $* and
$# variables have been removed</b> <br>
$*, which was deprecated in favor of the &quot;/s&quot; and
&quot;/m&quot; regexp modifiers, has been removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The deprecated
$# variable (output format for numbers) has been
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two new severe
warnings, &quot;$#/$* is no longer supported&quot;, have
been added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>substr()
lvalues are no longer fixed-length</b> <br>
The lvalues returned by the three argument form of
<b>substr()</b> used to be a &quot;fixed length window&quot;
on the original string. In some cases this could cause
surprising action at distance or other undefined behaviour.
Now the length of the window adjusts itself to the length of
the string assigned to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Parsing of
&quot;&minus;f _&quot;</b> <br>
The identifier &quot;_&quot; is now forced to be a bareword
after a filetest operator. This solves a number of
misparsing issues when a global &quot;_&quot; subroutine is
defined.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;:unique&quot;</b>
<br>
The &quot;:unique&quot; attribute has been made a no-op,
since its current implementation was fundamentally flawed
and not threadsafe.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Effect of
pragmas in eval</b> <br>
The compile-time value of the &quot;%^H&quot; hint variable
can now propagate into eval(&quot;&quot;)uated code. This
makes it more useful to implement lexical pragmas.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a
side-effect of this, the overloaded-ness of constants now
propagates into eval(&quot;&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>chdir
<small>FOO</small></b> <br>
A bareword argument to <b>chdir()</b> is now recognized as a
file handle. Earlier releases interpreted the bareword as a
directory name. (Gisle Aas)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Handling of
.pmc files</b> <br>
An old feature of perl was that before &quot;require&quot;
or &quot;use&quot; look for a file with a <i>.pm</i>
extension, they will first look for a similar filename with
a <i>.pmc</i> extension. If this file is found, it will be
loaded in place of any potentially existing file ending in a
<i>.pm</i> extension.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Previously,
<i>.pmc</i> files were loaded only if more recent than the
matching <i>.pm</i> file. Starting with 5.9.4, they&rsquo;ll
be always loaded if they exist.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$^V is now a
&quot;version&quot; object instead of a v&minus;string</b>
<br>
$^V can still be used with the %vd format in printf, but any
character-level operations will now access the string
representation of the &quot;version&quot; object and not the
ordinals of a v&minus;string. Expressions like
&quot;substr($^V, 0, 2)&quot; or &quot;split //, $^V&quot;
no longer work and must be rewritten.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>@&minus; and
@+ in patterns</b> <br>
The special arrays &quot;@&minus;&quot; and &quot;@+&quot;
are no longer interpolated in regular expressions. (Sadahiro
Tomoyuki)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$AUTOLOAD
can now be tainted</b> <br>
If you call a subroutine by a tainted name, and if it defers
to an <small>AUTOLOAD</small> function, then $AUTOLOAD will
be (correctly) tainted. (Rick Delaney)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tainting and
printf</b> <br>
When perl is run under taint mode, &quot;printf()&quot; and
&quot;sprintf()&quot; will now reject any tainted format
argument. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>undef and
signal handlers</b> <br>
Undefining or deleting a signal handler via &quot;undef
$SIG{FOO}&quot; is now equivalent to setting it to
'DEFAULT'. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>strictures
and dereferencing in defined()</b> <br>
&quot;use strict 'refs'&quot; was ignoring taking a hard
reference in an argument to <b>defined()</b>, as in :</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use strict
'refs'; <br>
my $x = 'foo'; <br>
if (defined $$x) {...}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This now
correctly produces the run-time error &quot;Can't use string
as a SCALAR ref while &quot;strict refs&quot; in
use&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;defined
@$foo&quot; and &quot;defined %$bar&quot; are now also
subject to &quot;strict 'refs'&quot; (that is, $foo and $bar
shall be proper references there.)
(&quot;defined(@foo)&quot; and &quot;defined(%bar)&quot; are
discouraged constructs anyway.) (Nicholas Clark)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;(?p{})&quot;
has been removed</b> <br>
The regular expression construct &quot;(?p{})&quot;, which
was deprecated in perl 5.8, has been removed. Use
&quot;(??{})&quot; instead. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pseudo-hashes
have been removed</b> <br>
Support for pseudo-hashes has been removed from Perl 5.9.
(The &quot;fields&quot; pragma remains here, but uses an
alternate implementation.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Removal of
the bytecode compiler and of perlcc</b> <br>
&quot;perlcc&quot;, the byteloader and the supporting
modules (B::C, B::CC, B::Bytecode, etc.) are no longer
distributed with the perl sources. Those experimental tools
have never worked reliably, and, due to the lack of
volunteers to keep them in line with the perl interpreter
developments, it was decided to remove them instead of
shipping a broken version of those. The last version of
those modules can be found with perl 5.9.4.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However the B
compiler framework stays supported in the perl core, as with
the more useful modules it has permitted (among others,
B::Deparse and B::Concise).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Removal of
the <small>JPL</small></b> <br>
The <small>JPL</small> (Java-Perl Lingo) has been removed
from the perl sources tarball.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Recursive
inheritance detected earlier</b> <br>
Perl will now immediately throw an exception if you modify
any package&rsquo;s @ISA in such a way that it would cause
recursive inheritance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Previously, the
exception would not occur until Perl attempted to make use
of the recursive inheritance while resolving a method or
doing a &quot;$foo&minus;&gt;isa($bar)&quot; lookup.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>warnings::enabled

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Upgrading
individual core modules</b> <br>
Even more core modules are now also available separately
through the <small>CPAN.</small> If you wish to update one
of these modules, you don&rsquo;t need to wait for a new
perl release. From within the cpan shell, running the
&rsquo;r&rsquo; command will report on modules with upgrades

information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pragmata
Changes</b> <br>
&quot;feature&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The new pragma
&quot;feature&quot; is used to enable new features that
might break old code. See &quot;The &quot;feature&quot;
pragma&quot; above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;mro&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">This new pragma enables to
change the algorithm used to resolve inherited methods. See
&quot;New Pragma, &quot;mro&quot;&quot; above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Scoping of the &quot;sort&quot;
pragma</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;sort&quot; pragma is
now lexically scoped. Its effect used to be global.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Scoping of &quot;bignum&quot;,
&quot;bigint&quot;, &quot;bigrat&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The three numeric pragmas
&quot;bignum&quot;, &quot;bigint&quot; and
&quot;bigrat&quot; are now lexically scoped. (Tels)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;base&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;base&quot; pragma now
warns if a class tries to inherit from itself. (Curtis
&quot;Ovid&quot; Poe)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;strict&quot; and
&quot;warnings&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;strict&quot; and
&quot;warnings&quot; will now complain loudly if they are
loaded via incorrect casing (as in &quot;use Strict;&quot;).
(Johan Vromans)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;version&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;version&quot; module
provides support for version objects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;warnings&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;warnings&quot; pragma
doesn&rsquo;t load &quot;Carp&quot; anymore. That means that
code that used &quot;Carp&quot; routines without having
loaded it at compile time might need to be adjusted;
typically, the following (faulty) code won&rsquo;t work
anymore, and will require parentheses to be added after the
function name:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">use warnings;
<br>
require Carp; <br>
Carp::confess 'argh';</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;less&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;less&quot; now does
something useful (or at least it tries to). In fact, it has
been turned into a lexical pragma. So, in your modules, you
can now test whether your users have requested to use less
<small>CPU,</small> or less memory, less magic, or maybe
even less fat. See less for more. (Joshua ben Jore)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl
&minus;d</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The Perl debugger can now save
all debugger commands for sourcing later; notably, it can
now emulate stepping backwards, by restarting and rerunning
all bar the last command from a saved command history.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It can also
display the parent inheritance tree of a given class, with
the &quot;i&quot; command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ptar</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;ptar&quot; is a pure perl
implementation of &quot;tar&quot; that comes with
&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ptardiff</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;ptardiff&quot; is a small
utility used to generate a diff between the contents of a
tar archive and a directory tree. Like &quot;ptar&quot;, it
comes with &quot;Archive::Tar&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">shasum</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;shasum&quot; is a
command-line utility, used to print or to check
<small>SHA</small> digests. It comes with the new
&quot;Digest::SHA&quot; module.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">corelist</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;corelist&quot;
utility is now installed with perl (see &quot;New
modules&quot; above).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">h2ph and h2xs</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;h2ph&quot; and
&quot;h2xs&quot; have been made more robust with regard to
&quot;modern&quot; C code.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;h2xs&quot;
implements a new option
&quot;&minus;&minus;use&minus;xsloader&quot; to force use of
&quot;XSLoader&quot; even in backwards compatible
modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The handling of
authors&rsquo; names that had apostrophes has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any enums with
negative values are now skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">perlivp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;perlivp&quot; no longer
checks for <i>*.ph</i> files by default. Use the new
&quot;&minus;a&quot; option to run <i>all</i> tests.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">find2perl</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;find2perl&quot; now
assumes &quot;&minus;print&quot; as a default action.
Previously, it needed to be specified explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Several bugs
have been fixed in &quot;find2perl&quot;, regarding
&quot;&minus;exec&quot; and &quot;&minus;eval&quot;. Also
the options &quot;&minus;path&quot;,
&quot;&minus;ipath&quot; and &quot;&minus;iname&quot; have
been added.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">config_data</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;config_data&quot; is a
new utility that comes with &quot;Module::Build&quot;. It
provides a command-line interface to the configuration of
Perl modules that use Module::Build&rsquo;s framework of
configurability (that is, *::ConfigData modules that contain
local configuration information for their parent
modules.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">cpanp</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;cpanp&quot;, the

<h2>Performance Enhancements
<a name="Performance Enhancements"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>In-place
sorting</b> <br>
Sorting arrays in place (&quot;@a = sort @a&quot;) is now
optimized to avoid making a temporary copy of the array.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Likewise,
&quot;reverse sort ...&quot; is now optimized to sort in
reverse, avoiding the generation of a temporary intermediate
list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Lexical
array access</b> <br>
Access to elements of lexical arrays via a numeric constant
between 0 and 255 is now faster. (This used to be only the
case for global arrays.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>XS-assisted
<small>SWASHGET</small></b> <br>
Some pure-perl code that perl was using to retrieve Unicode
properties and transliteration mappings has been
reimplemented in <small>XS.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Constant
subroutines</b> <br>
The interpreter internals now support a far more memory
efficient form of inlineable constants. Storing a reference
to a constant value in a symbol table is equivalent to a
full typeglob referencing a constant subroutine, but using
about 400 bytes less memory. This proxy constant subroutine
is automatically upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine
if necessary. The approach taken is analogous to the
existing space optimisation for subroutine stub
declarations, which are stored as plain scalars in place of
the full typeglob.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several of the
core modules have been converted to use this feature for
their system dependent constants &minus; as a result
&quot;use POSIX;&quot; now takes about 200K less memory.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV&quot;</b>
<br>
The new compilation flag &quot;PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV&quot;,
introduced as an option in perl 5.8.8, is turned on by
default in perl 5.9.3. It prevents perl from creating an
empty scalar with every new typeglob. See perl589delta for
details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Weak
references are cheaper</b> <br>
Weak reference creation is now <i>O(1)</i> rather than
<i>O(n)</i>, courtesy of Nicholas Clark. Weak reference
deletion remains <i>O(n)</i>, but if deletion only happens
at program exit, it may be skipped completely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sort()
enhancements</b> <br>
Salvador Fandin~o provided improvements to reduce the memory
usage of &quot;sort&quot; and to speed up some cases.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Memory
optimisations</b> <br>
Several internal data structures (typeglobs, GVs, CVs,
formats) have been restructured to use less memory.
(Nicholas Clark)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>UTF&minus;8</small>
cache optimisation</b> <br>
The <small>UTF&minus;8</small> caching code is now more
efficient, and used more often. (Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Sloppy stat
on Windows</b> <br>
On Windows, perl&rsquo;s <b>stat()</b> function normally
opens the file to determine the link count and update
attributes that may have been changed through hard links.
Setting ${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT} to a true value speeds up
<b>stat()</b> by not performing this operation. (Jan
Dubois)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Regular
expressions optimisations</b> <br>
Engine de-recursivised</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The regular expression engine
is no longer recursive, meaning that patterns that used to
overflow the stack will either die with useful explanations,
or run to completion, which, since they were able to blow
the stack before, will likely take a very long time to
happen. If you were experiencing the occasional stack
overflow (or segfault) and upgrade to discover that now perl
apparently hangs instead, look for a degenerate regex. (Dave
Mitchell)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Single char char-classes
treated as literals</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Classes of a single character
are now treated the same as if the character had been used
as a literal, meaning that code that uses char-classes as an
escaping mechanism will see a speedup. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Trie optimisation of literal
string alternations</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Alternations, where possible,
are optimised into more efficient matching structures.
String literal alternations are merged into a trie and are
matched simultaneously. This means that instead of O(N) time
for matching N alternations at a given point, the new code
performs in O(1) time. A new special variable,
${^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF}, has been added to fine-tune this
optimization. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Note:</b>
Much code exists that works around perl&rsquo;s historic
poor performance on alternations. Often the tricks used to
do so will disable the new optimisations. Hopefully the
utility modules used for this purpose will be educated about
these new optimisations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Aho-Corasick start-point
optimisation</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When a pattern starts with a
trie-able alternation and there aren&rsquo;t better
optimisations available, the regex engine will use
Aho-Corasick matching to find the start point. (Yves
Orton)</p>

<h2>Installation and Configuration Improvements
<a name="Installation and Configuration Improvements"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Configuration
improvements</b> <br>
&quot;&minus;Dusesitecustomize&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Run-time customization of @INC
can be enabled by passing the
&quot;&minus;Dusesitecustomize&quot; flag to Configure. When
enabled, this will make perl run
<i>$sitelibexp/sitecustomize.pl</i> before anything else.
This script can then be set up to add additional entries to
@INC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Relocatable installations</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">There is now Configure support
for creating a relocatable perl tree. If you Configure with
&quot;&minus;Duserelocatableinc&quot;, then the paths in
@INC (and everything else in %Config) can be optionally
located via the path of the perl executable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">That means
that, if the string &quot;.../&quot; is found at the start
of any path, it&rsquo;s substituted with the directory of
$^X. So, the relocation can be configured on a per-directory
basis, although the default with
&quot;&minus;Duserelocatableinc&quot; is that everything is
relocated. The initial install is done to the original
configured prefix.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>strlcat()</b> and
<b>strlcpy()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The configuration process now
detects whether <b>strlcat()</b> and <b>strlcpy()</b> are
available. When they are not available, perl&rsquo;s own
version is used (from Russ Allbery&rsquo;s public domain
implementation). Various places in the perl interpreter now
use them. (Steve Peters)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;d_pseudofork&quot; and
&quot;d_printf_format_null&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A new configuration variable,
available as $Config{d_pseudofork} in the Config module, has
been added, to distinguish real <b>fork()</b> support from
fake pseudofork used on Windows platforms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A new
configuration variable, &quot;d_printf_format_null&quot;,
has been added, to see if printf-like formats are allowed to
be <small>NULL.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Configure help</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;Configure &minus;h&quot;
has been extended with the most commonly used options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Compilation
improvements</b> <br>
Parallel build</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Parallel makes should work
properly now, although there may still be problems if
&quot;make test&quot; is instructed to run in parallel.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Borland&rsquo;s compilers
support</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Building with Borland&rsquo;s
compilers on Win32 should work more smoothly. In particular
Steve Hay has worked to side step many warnings emitted by
their compilers and at least one C compiler internal
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Static build on Windows</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perl extensions on Windows now
can be statically built into the Perl
<small>DLL.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Also,
it&rsquo;s now possible to build a
&quot;perl&minus;static.exe&quot; that doesn&rsquo;t depend
on the Perl <small>DLL</small> on Win32. See the Win32
makefiles for details. (Vadim Konovalov)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ppport.h files</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All <i>ppport.h</i> files in
the <small>XS</small> modules bundled with perl are now
autogenerated at build time. (Marcus Holland-Moritz)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">C <small>++</small>
compatibility</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Efforts have been made to make
perl and the core <small>XS</small> modules compilable with
various C <small>++</small> compilers (although the
situation is not perfect with some of the compilers on some
of the platforms tested.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Support for Microsoft
64&minus;bit compiler</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Support for building perl with
Microsoft&rsquo;s 64&minus;bit compiler has been improved.
(ActiveState)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Visual C <small>++</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Perl can now be compiled with
Microsoft Visual C <small>++</small> 2005 (and 2008 Beta
2).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Win32 builds</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">All win32 builds (MS-Win,

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">strictures in

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;strict&quot; wasn&rsquo;t

(&quot;/(?{...})/&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Calling
<b>CORE::require()</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><b>CORE::require()</b> and
<b>CORE::do()</b> were always parsed as <b>require()</b> and
<b>do()</b> when they were overridden. This is now
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Subscripts of slices</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">You can now use a non-arrowed
form for chained subscripts after a list slice, like in:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">({foo =&gt;
&quot;bar&quot;})[0]{foo}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This used to be
a syntax error; a &quot;&minus;&gt;&quot; was required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;no warnings
'category'&quot; works correctly with &minus;w</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Previously when running with
warnings enabled globally via &quot;&minus;w&quot;,
selective disabling of specific warning categories would
actually turn off all warnings. This is now fixed; now
&quot;no warnings 'io';&quot; will only turn off warnings in
the &quot;io&quot; class. Previously it would erroneously
turn off all warnings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">threads improvements</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Several memory leaks in
ithreads were closed. Also, ithreads were made less
memory-intensive.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;threads&quot;
is now a dual-life module, also available on
<small>CPAN.</small> It has been expanded in many ways. A
<b>kill()</b> method is available for thread signalling. One
can get thread status, or the list of running or joinable
threads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A new
&quot;threads&minus;&gt;exit()&quot; method is used to exit
from the application (this is the default for the main
thread) or from the current thread only (this is the default
for all other threads). On the other hand, the <b>exit()</b>
built-in now always causes the whole application to
terminate. (Jerry D. Hedden)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>chr()</b> and negative
values</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><b>chr()</b> on a negative
value now gives &quot;\x{FFFD}&quot;, the Unicode
replacement character, unless when the &quot;bytes&quot;
pragma is in effect, where the low eight bits of the value
are used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>PERL5SHELL</small> and
tainting</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">On Windows, the
<small>PERL5SHELL</small> environment variable is now
checked for taintedness. (Rafael Garcia-Suarez)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Using *FILE{ <small>IO</small>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">&quot;stat()&quot; and
&quot;&minus;X&quot; filetests now treat *FILE{
<small>IO</small> } filehandles like *FILE filehandles.
(Steve Peters)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Overloading and reblessing</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Overloading now works when
references are reblessed into another class. Internally,
this has been implemented by moving the flag for
&quot;overloading&quot; from the reference to the referent,
which logically is where it should always have been.
(Nicholas Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Overloading and
<small>UTF&minus;8</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A few bugs related to
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> handling with objects that have
stringification overloaded have been fixed. (Nicholas
Clark)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">eval memory leaks fixed</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Traditionally, &quot;eval
'syntax error'&quot; has leaked badly. Many (but not all) of
these leaks have now been eliminated or reduced. (Dave
Mitchell)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Random device on Windows</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">In previous versions, perl
would read the file <i>/dev/urandom</i> if it existed when
seeding its random number generator. That file is unlikely
to exist on Windows, and if it did would probably not
contain appropriate data, so perl no longer tries to read it
on Windows. (Alex Davies)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><small>PERLIO_DEBUG</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot;
environment variable no longer has any effect for setuid
scripts and for scripts run with <b>&minus;T</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Moreover, with
a thread-enabled perl, using &quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot; could
lead to an internal buffer overflow. This has been
fixed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">PerlIO::scalar and read-only
scalars</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">PerlIO::scalar will now prevent
writing to read-only scalars. Moreover, <b>seek()</b> is now
supported with PerlIO::scalar&minus;based filehandles, the
underlying string being zero-filled as needed. (Rafael,
Jarkko Hietaniemi)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>study()</b> and
<small>UTF&minus;8</small></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><b>study()</b> never worked for
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> strings, but could lead to false
results. It&rsquo;s now a no-op on
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> data. (Yves Orton)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Critical signals</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The signals <small>SIGILL,
SIGBUS</small> and <small>SIGSEGV</small> are now always
delivered in an &quot;unsafe&quot; manner (contrary to other
signals, that are deferred until the perl interpreter
reaches a reasonably stable state; see &quot;Deferred
Signals (Safe Signals)&quot; in perlipc). (Rafael)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">@INC&minus;hook fix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When a module or a file is
loaded through an @INC&minus;hook, and when this hook has
set a filename entry in %INC, __FILE__ is now set for this
module accordingly to the contents of that %INC entry.
(Rafael)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">&quot;&minus;t&quot; switch
fix</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The &quot;&minus;w&quot; and
&quot;&minus;t&quot; switches can now be used together
without messing up which categories of warnings are
activated. (Rafael)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Duping
<small>UTF&minus;8</small> filehandles</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Duping a filehandle which has
the &quot;:utf8&quot; PerlIO layer set will now properly
carry that layer on the duped filehandle. (Rafael)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Localisation of hash
elements</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Localizing a hash element whose
key was given as a variable didn&rsquo;t work correctly if
the variable was changed while the <b>local()</b> was in

<h2>Changed Internals
<a name="Changed Internals"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In general, the
source code of perl has been refactored, tidied up, and
optimized in many places. Also, memory management and
allocation has been improved in several points.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When compiling
the perl core with gcc, as many gcc warning flags are turned
on as is possible on the platform. (This quest for
cleanliness doesn&rsquo;t extend to <small>XS</small> code
because we cannot guarantee the tidiness of code we
didn&rsquo;t write.) Similar strictness flags have been
added or tightened for various other C compilers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Reordering
of SVt_* constants</b> <br>
The relative ordering of constants that define the various
types of &quot;SV&quot; have changed; in particular,
&quot;SVt_PVGV&quot; has been moved before
&quot;SVt_PVLV&quot;, &quot;SVt_PVAV&quot;,
&quot;SVt_PVHV&quot; and &quot;SVt_PVCV&quot;. This is
unlikely to make any difference unless you have code that
explicitly makes assumptions about that ordering. (The
inheritance hierarchy of &quot;B::*&quot; objects has been
changed to reflect this.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Elimination
of SVt_PVBM</b> <br>
Related to this, the internal type &quot;SVt_PVBM&quot; has
been removed. This dedicated type of &quot;SV&quot; was used
by the &quot;index&quot; operator and parts of the regexp
engine to facilitate fast Boyer-Moore matches. Its use
internally has been replaced by &quot;SV&quot;s of type
&quot;SVt_PVGV&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New type
SVt_BIND</b> <br>
A new type &quot;SVt_BIND&quot; has been added, in readiness
for the project to implement Perl 6 on 5. There deliberately
is no implementation yet, and they cannot yet be created or
destroyed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Removal of
<small>CPP</small> symbols</b> <br>
The C preprocessor symbols &quot;PERL_PM_APIVERSION&quot;
and &quot;PERL_XS_APIVERSION&quot;, which were supposed to
give the version number of the oldest perl binary-compatible
(resp. source-compatible) with the present one, were not
used, and sometimes had misleading values. They have been
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Less space
is used by ops</b> <br>
The &quot;BASEOP&quot; structure now uses less space. The
&quot;op_seq&quot; field has been removed and replaced by a
single bit bit-field &quot;op_opt&quot;. &quot;op_type&quot;
is now 9 bits long. (Consequently, the &quot;B::OP&quot;
class doesn&rsquo;t provide an &quot;seq&quot; method
anymore.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New
parser</b> <br>
perl&rsquo;s parser is now generated by bison (it used to be
generated by byacc.) As a result, it seems to be a bit more
robust.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also, Dave
Mitchell improved the lexer debugging output under
&quot;&minus;DT&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Use of
&quot;const&quot;</b> <br>
Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine which
function parameters and local variables could actually be
declared &quot;const&quot; to the C compiler. Steve Peters
provided new *_set macros and reworked the core to use these
rather than assigning to macros in <small>LVALUE</small>
context.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Mathoms</b>
<br>
A new file, <i>mathoms.c</i>, has been added. It contains
functions that are no longer used in the perl core, but that
remain available for binary or source compatibility reasons.
However, those functions will not be compiled in if you add
&quot;&minus;DNO_MATHOMS&quot; in the compiler flags.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;AvFLAGS&quot;
has been removed</b> <br>
The &quot;AvFLAGS&quot; macro has been removed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;av_*&quot;
changes</b> <br>
The &quot;av_*()&quot; functions, used to manipulate arrays,
no longer accept null &quot;AV*&quot; parameters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$^H and
%^H</b> <br>
The implementation of the special variables $^H and %^H has
changed, to allow implementing lexical pragmas in pure
Perl.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>B:: modules
inheritance changed</b> <br>
The inheritance hierarchy of &quot;B::&quot; modules has
changed; &quot;B::NV&quot; now inherits from
&quot;B::SV&quot; (it used to inherit from
&quot;B::IV&quot;).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Anonymous
hash and array constructors</b> <br>
The anonymous hash and array constructors now take 1 op in
the optree instead of 3, now that pp_anonhash and
pp_anonlist return a reference to a hash/array when the op
is flagged with OPf_SPECIAL. (Nicholas Clark)</p>

<h2>Known Problems
<a name="Known Problems"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There&rsquo;s
still a remaining problem in the implementation of the
lexical $_: it doesn&rsquo;t work inside
&quot;/(?{...})/&quot; blocks. (See the <small>TODO</small>
test in <i>t/op/mydef.t</i>.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Stacked
filetest operators won&rsquo;t work when the
&quot;filetest&quot; pragma is in effect, because they rely
on the <b>stat()</b> buffer &quot;_&quot; being populated,
and filetest bypasses <b>stat()</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><small>UTF&minus;8</small>
problems</b> <br>
The handling of Unicode still is unclean in several places,
where it&rsquo;s dependent on whether a string is internally
flagged as <small>UTF&minus;8.</small> This will be made
more consistent in perl 5.12, but that won&rsquo;t be
possible without a certain amount of backwards
incompatibility.</p>

<h2>Platform Specific Problems
<a name="Platform Specific Problems"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When compiled
with g++ and thread support on Linux, it&rsquo;s reported
that the $! stops working correctly. This is related to the
fact that the glibc provides two <b>strerror_r</b>(3)
implementation, and perl selects the wrong one.</p>
