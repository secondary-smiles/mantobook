<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd&minus;cryptenroll</b>
is a tool for enrolling hardware security tokens and devices
into a LUKS2 encrypted volume, which may then be used to
unlock the volume during boot. Specifically, it supports
tokens and credentials of the following kind to be
enrolled:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">1. PKCS#11
security tokens and smartcards that may carry an RSA key
pair (e.g. various YubiKeys)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">2. FIDO2
security tokens that implement the
&quot;hmac&minus;secret&quot; extension (most FIDO2 keys,
including YubiKeys)</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">3. TPM2
security devices</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">4. Regular
passphrases</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">5. Recovery
keys. These are similar to regular passphrases, however are
randomly generated on the computer and thus generally have
higher entropy than user&minus;chosen passphrases. Their
character set has been designed to ensure they are easy to
type in, while having high entropy. They may also be scanned
off screen using QR codes. Recovery keys may be used for
unlocking LUKS2 volumes wherever passphrases are accepted.
They are intended to be used in combination with an enrolled
hardware security token, as a recovery option when the token
is lost.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition,
the tool may be used to enumerate currently enrolled
security tokens and wipe a subset of them. The latter may be
combined with the enrollment operation of a new security
token, in order to update or replace enrollments.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The tool
supports only LUKS2 volumes, as it stores token
meta&minus;information in the LUKS2 JSON token area, which
is not available in other encryption formats.</p>

<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
currently when enrolling a new key of one of the five
supported types listed above, it is required to first
provide a passphrase, a recovery key or a FIDO2 token. It's
currently not supported to unlock a device with a
TPM2/PKCS#11 key in order to enroll a new TPM2/PKCS#11 key.
Thus, if in future key roll&minus;over is desired it's
generally recommended to ensure a passphrase, a recovery key
or a FIDO2 token is always enrolled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also note that
support for enrolling multiple FIDO2 tokens is currently
limited. When multiple FIDO2 tokens are enrolled,
<b>systemd&minus;cryptseup</b> will perform pre&minus;flight
requests to attempt to identify which of the enrolled tokens
are currently plugged in. However, this is not possible for
FIDO2 tokens with user verification (UV, usually via
biometrics), in which case it will fall back to attempting
each enrolled token one by one. This will result in multiple
prompts for PIN and user verification. This limitation does
not apply to PKCS#11 tokens.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are understood:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;password</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enroll a regular
password/passphrase. This command is mostly equivalent to
<b>cryptsetup luksAddKey</b>, however may be combined with
<b>&minus;&minus;wipe&minus;slot=</b> in one call, see
below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;recovery&minus;key</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enroll a recovery key. Recovery
keys are mostly identical to passphrases, but are
computer&minus;generated instead of being chosen by a human,
and thus have a guaranteed high entropy. The key uses a
character set that is easy to type in, and may be scanned
off screen via a QR code.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;unlock&minus;key&minus;file=</b><i>PATH</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use a file instead of a
password/passphrase read from stdin to unlock the volume.
Expects the PATH to the file containing your key to unlock
the volume. Currently there is nothing like
<b>&minus;&minus;key&minus;file&minus;offset=</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;key&minus;file&minus;size=</b> so this file
has to only contain the full key.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;unlock&minus;fido2&minus;device=</b><i>PATH</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Use a FIDO2 device instead of a
password/passphrase read from stdin to unlock the volume.
Expects a hidraw device referring to the FIDO2 device (e.g.
/dev/hidraw1). Alternatively the special value
&quot;auto&quot; may be specified, in order to automatically
determine the device node of a currently plugged in security
token (of which there must be exactly one). This automatic
discovery is unsupported if
<b>&minus;&minus;fido2&minus;device=</b> option is also
specified.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;pkcs11&minus;token&minus;uri=</b><i>URI</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enroll a PKCS#11 security token
or smartcard (e.g. a YubiKey). Expects a PKCS#11 smartcard
URI referring to the token. Alternatively the special value
&quot;auto&quot; may be specified, in order to automatically
determine the URI of a currently plugged in security token
(of which there must be exactly one). The special value
&quot;list&quot; may be used to enumerate all suitable
PKCS#11 tokens currently plugged in. The security token must
contain an RSA key pair which is used to encrypt the
randomly generated key that is used to unlock the LUKS2
volume. The encrypted key is then stored in the LUKS2 JSON
token header area.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled PKCS#11 security
token, specify the <b>pkcs11&minus;uri=</b> option in the
respective /etc/crypttab line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">myvolume
/dev/sda1 &minus; pkcs11&minus;uri=auto</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>crypttab</b>(5) for a more comprehensive example of a
<b>systemd&minus;cryptenroll</b> invocation and its matching
/etc/crypttab line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;fido2&minus;credential&minus;algorithm=</b><i>STRING</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify COSE algorithm used in
credential generation. The default value is
&quot;es256&quot;. Supported values are &quot;es256&quot;,
&quot;rs256&quot; and &quot;eddsa&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;es256&quot;
denotes ECDSA over NIST P&minus;256 with SHA&minus;256.
&quot;rs256&quot; denotes 2048&minus;bit RSA with PKCS#1.5
padding and SHA&minus;256. &quot;eddsa&quot; denotes EDDSA
over Curve25519 with SHA&minus;512.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that your
authenticator may not support some algorithms.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;fido2&minus;device=</b><i>PATH</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enroll a FIDO2 security token
that implements the &quot;hmac&minus;secret&quot; extension
(e.g. a YubiKey). Expects a hidraw device referring to the
FIDO2 device (e.g. /dev/hidraw1). Alternatively the special
value &quot;auto&quot; may be specified, in order to
automatically determine the device node of a currently
plugged in security token (of which there must be exactly
one). This automatic discovery is unsupported if
<b>&minus;&minus;unlock&minus;fido2&minus;device=</b> option
is also specified. The special value &quot;list&quot; may be
used to enumerate all suitable FIDO2 tokens currently
plugged in. Note that many hardware security tokens that
implement FIDO2 also implement the older PKCS#11 standard.
Typically FIDO2 is preferable, given it's simpler to use and
more modern.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled FIDO2 security token,
specify the <b>fido2&minus;device=</b> option in the
respective /etc/crypttab line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">myvolume
/dev/sda1 &minus; fido2&minus;device=auto</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>crypttab</b>(5) for a more comprehensive example of a
<b>systemd&minus;cryptenroll</b> invocation and its matching
/etc/crypttab line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;fido2&minus;with&minus;client&minus;pin=</b><i>BOOL</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When enrolling a FIDO2 security
token, controls whether to require the user to enter a PIN
when unlocking the volume (the FIDO2 &quot;clientPin&quot;
feature). Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;. (Note: this setting
is without effect if the security token does not support the
&quot;clientPin&quot; feature at all, or does not allow
enabling or disabling it.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;fido2&minus;with&minus;user&minus;presence=</b><i>BOOL</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When enrolling a FIDO2 security
token, controls whether to require the user to verify
presence (tap the token, the FIDO2 &quot;up&quot; feature)
when unlocking the volume. Defaults to &quot;yes&quot;.
(Note: this setting is without effect if the security token
does not support the &quot;up&quot; feature at all, or does
not allow enabling or disabling it.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;fido2&minus;with&minus;user&minus;verification=</b><i>BOOL</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When enrolling a FIDO2 security
token, controls whether to require user verification when
unlocking the volume (the FIDO2 &quot;uv&quot; feature).
Defaults to &quot;no&quot;. (Note: this setting is without
effect if the security token does not support the
&quot;uv&quot; feature at all, or does not allow enabling or
disabling it.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;device=</b><i>PATH</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Enroll a TPM2 security chip.
Expects a device node path referring to the TPM2 chip (e.g.
/dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively the special value
&quot;auto&quot; may be specified, in order to automatically
determine the device node of a currently discovered TPM2
device (of which there must be exactly one). The special
value &quot;list&quot; may be used to enumerate all suitable
TPM2 devices currently discovered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled TPM2 security chip,
specify the <b>tpm2&minus;device=</b> option in the
respective /etc/crypttab line:</p>

<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">myvolume
/dev/sda1 &minus; tpm2&minus;device=auto</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See
<b>crypttab</b>(5) for a more comprehensive example of a
<b>systemd&minus;cryptenroll</b> invocation and its matching
/etc/crypttab line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;pcrs=</b> (see below) to
configure which TPM2 PCR indexes to bind the enrollment
to.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;pcrs=</b>
[PCR...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Configures the TPM2 PCRs
(Platform Configuration Registers) to bind the enrollment
requested via <b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;device=</b> to.
Takes a &quot;+&quot; separated list of numeric PCR indexes
in the range 0...23. If not used, defaults to PCR 7 only. If
an empty string is specified, binds the enrollment to no
PCRs at all. PCRs allow binding the enrollment to specific
software versions and system state, so that the enrolled
unlocking key is only accessible (may be
&quot;unsealed&quot;) if specific trusted software and/or
configuration is used.</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Table&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Well&minus;known
PCR Definitions</b> <br>
For most applications it should be sufficient to bind
against PCR 7 (and possibly PCR 14, if shim/MOK is desired),
as this includes measurements of the trusted certificates
(and possibly hashes) that are used to validate all
components of the boot process up to and including the OS
kernel. In order to simplify firmware and OS version updates
it's typically not advisable to include PCRs such as 0 and 2
in the binding of the enrollment, since the program code
they cover should already be protected indirectly through
the certificates measured into PCR 7. Validation through
these certificates is typically preferable over validation
through direct measurements as it is less brittle in context
of OS/firmware updates: the measurements will change on
every update, but code signatures likely will validate
against pre&minus;existing certificates.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;with&minus;pin=</b><i>BOOL</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">When enrolling a TPM2 device,
controls whether to require the user to enter a PIN when
unlocking the volume in addition to PCR binding, based on
TPM2 policy authentication. Defaults to &quot;no&quot;.
Despite being called PIN, any character can be used, not
just numbers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
incorrect PIN entry when unlocking increments the TPM
dictionary attack lockout mechanism, and may lock out users
for a prolonged time, depending on its configuration. The
lockout mechanism is a global property of the TPM,
<b>systemd&minus;cryptenroll</b> does not control or
configure the lockout mechanism. You may use tpm2&minus;tss
tools to inspect or configure the dictionary attack lockout,
with <b>tpm2_getcap</b>(1) and
<b>tpm2_dictionarylockout</b>(1) commands, respectively.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;public&minus;key=</b>
[PATH],
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;public&minus;key&minus;pcrs=</b>
[PCR...], <b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;signature=</b>
[PATH]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Configures a TPM2 signed PCR
policy to bind encryption to. The
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;public&minus;key=</b> option
accepts a path to a PEM encoded RSA public key, to bind the
encryption to. If this is not specified explicitly, but a
file tpm2&minus;pcr&minus;public&minus;key.pem exists in one
of the directories /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/,
/usr/lib/systemd/ (searched in this order), it is
automatically used. The
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;public&minus;key&minus;pcrs=</b>
option takes a list of TPM2 PCR indexes to bind to (same
syntax as <b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;pcrs=</b> described
above). If not specified defaults to 11 (i.e. this binds the
policy to any unified kernel image for which a PCR signature
can be provided).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note the
difference between <b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;pcrs=</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;public&minus;key&minus;pcrs=</b>:
the former binds decryption to the current, specific PCR
values; the latter binds decryption to any set of PCR values
for which a signature by the specified public key can be
provided. The latter is hence more useful in scenarios where
software updates shell be possible without losing access to
all previously encrypted LUKS2 volumes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;signature=</b> option takes a
path to a TPM2 PCR signature file as generated by the
<b>systemd-measure</b>(1) tool. If this is not specified
explicitly a suitable signature file
tpm2&minus;pcr&minus;signature.json is searched for in
/etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/, /usr/lib/systemd/ (in this
order) and used. If a signature file is specified or found
it is used to verify if the volume can be unlocked with it
given the current PCR state, before the new slot is written
to disk. This is intended as safety net to ensure that
access to a volume is not lost if a public key is enrolled
for which no valid signature for the current PCR state is
available. If the supplied signature does not unlock the
current PCR state and public key combination, no slot is
enrolled and the operation will fail. If no signature file
is specified or found no such safety verification is
done.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;wipe&minus;slot=</b>
[SLOT...]</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Wipes one or more LUKS2 key
slots. Takes a comma separated list of numeric slot indexes,
or the special strings &quot;all&quot; (for wiping all key
slots), &quot;empty&quot; (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by an empty passphrase), &quot;password&quot; (for
wiping all key slots that are unlocked by a traditional
passphrase), &quot;recovery&quot; (for wiping all key slots
that are unlocked by a recovery key), &quot;pkcs11&quot;
(for wiping all key slots that are unlocked by a PKCS#11
token), &quot;fido2&quot; (for wiping all key slots that are
unlocked by a FIDO2 token), &quot;tpm2&quot; (for wiping all
key slots that are unlocked by a TPM2 chip), or any
combination of these strings or numeric indexes, in which
case all slots matching either are wiped. As safety
precaution an operation that wipes all slots without
exception (so that the volume cannot be unlocked at all
anymore, unless the volume key is known) is refused.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This switch may
be used alone, in which case only the requested wipe
operation is executed. It may also be used in combination
with any of the enrollment options listed above, in which
case the enrollment is completed first, and only when
successful the wipe operation executed &mdash; and the newly
added slot is always excluded from the wiping. Combining
enrollment and slot wiping may thus be used to update
existing enrollments:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">systemd&minus;cryptenroll
/dev/sda1 &minus;&minus;wipe&minus;slot=tpm2
&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;device=auto</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The above
command will enroll the TPM2 chip, and then wipe all
previously created TPM2 enrollments on the LUKS2 volume,
leaving only the newly created one. Combining wiping and
enrollment may also be used to replace enrollments of
different types, for example for changing from a PKCS#11
enrollment to a FIDO2 one:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">systemd&minus;cryptenroll
/dev/sda1 &minus;&minus;wipe&minus;slot=pkcs11
&minus;&minus;fido2&minus;device=auto</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Or for
replacing an enrolled empty password by TPM2:</p>


<p style="margin-left:23%; margin-top: 1em">systemd&minus;cryptenroll
/dev/sda1 &minus;&minus;wipe&minus;slot=empty
&minus;&minus;tpm2&minus;device=auto</p>
