<h2>NAME

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">perl5200delta
&minus; what is new for perl v5.20.0</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes differences between the 5.18.0 release and the
5.20.0 release.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read
perl5180delta, which describes differences between 5.16.0
and 5.18.0.</p>

<h2>Core Enhancements
<a name="Core Enhancements"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Experimental
Subroutine signatures</b> <br>
Declarative syntax to unwrap argument list into lexical
variables. &quot;sub foo ($a,$b) {...}&quot; checks the
number of arguments and puts the arguments into lexical
variables. Signatures are not equivalent to the existing
idiom of &quot;sub foo { my($a,$b) = @_; ... }&quot;.
Signatures are only available by enabling a non-default
feature, and generate warnings about being experimental. The
syntactic clash with prototypes is managed by disabling the
short prototype syntax when signatures are enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">See
&quot;Signatures&quot; in perlsub for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;sub&quot;s
now take a &quot;prototype&quot; attribute</b> <br>
When declaring or defining a &quot;sub&quot;, the prototype
can now be specified inside of a &quot;prototype&quot;
attribute instead of in parens following the name.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
&quot;sub foo($$){}&quot; could be rewritten as &quot;sub
foo : prototype($$){}&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>More
consistent prototype parsing</b> <br>
Multiple semicolons in subroutine prototypes have long been
tolerated and treated as a single semicolon. There was one
case where this did not happen. A subroutine whose prototype
begins with &quot;*&quot; or &quot;;*&quot; can affect
whether a bareword is considered a method name or sub call.
This now applies also to &quot;;;;*&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Whitespace has
long been allowed inside subroutine prototypes, so
&quot;sub( $ $ )&quot; is equivalent to &quot;sub($$)&quot;,
but until now it was stripped when the subroutine was
parsed. Hence, whitespace was <i>not</i> allowed in
prototypes set by &quot;Scalar::Util::set_prototype&quot;.
Now it is permitted, and the parser no longer strips
whitespace. This means &quot;prototype &amp;mysub&quot;
returns the original prototype, whitespace and all.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;rand&quot;
now uses a consistent random number generator</b> <br>
Previously perl would use a platform specific random number
generator, varying between the libc <b>rand()</b>,
<b>random()</b> or <b>drand48()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This meant that
the quality of perl&rsquo;s random numbers would vary from
platform to platform, from the 15 bits of <b>rand()</b> on
Windows to 48&minus;bits on <small>POSIX</small> platforms
such as Linux with <b>drand48()</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Perl now uses
its own internal <b>drand48()</b> implementation on all
platforms. This does not make perl&rsquo;s &quot;rand&quot;
cryptographically secure. [perl #115928]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New slice
syntax</b> <br>
The new %hash{...} and %array[...] syntax returns a list of
key/value (or index/value) pairs. See &quot;Key/Value Hash
Slices&quot; in perldata.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Experimental
Postfix Dereferencing</b> <br>
When the &quot;postderef&quot; feature is in effect, the
following syntactical equivalencies are set up:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">$sref&minus;&gt;$*;
# same as ${ $sref } # interpolates <br>
$aref&minus;&gt;@*; # same as @{ $aref } # interpolates <br>
$href&minus;&gt;%*; # same as %{ $href } <br>
$cref&minus;&gt;&amp;*; # same as &amp;{ $cref } <br>
$gref&minus;&gt;**; # same as *{ $gref } <br>
$aref&minus;&gt;$#*; # same as $#{ $aref } <br>
$gref&minus;&gt;*{ $slot }; # same as *{ $gref }{ $slot }
<br>
$aref&minus;&gt;@[ ... ]; # same as @$aref[ ... ] #
interpolates <br>
$href&minus;&gt;@{ ... }; # same as @$href{ ... } #
interpolates <br>
$aref&minus;&gt;%[ ... ]; # same as %$aref[ ... ] <br>
$href&minus;&gt;%{ ... }; # same as %$href{ ... }</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Those marked as
interpolating only interpolate if the associated
&quot;postderef_qq&quot; feature is also enabled. This
feature is <b>experimental</b> and will trigger
&quot;experimental::postderef&quot;&minus;category warnings
when used, unless they are suppressed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For more
information, consult the Postfix Dereference Syntax section
of perlref.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unicode 6.3
now supported</b> <br>
Perl now supports and is shipped with Unicode 6.3 (though
Perl may be recompiled with any previous Unicode release as
well). A detailed list of Unicode 6.3 changes is at
&lt;http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.3.0/&gt;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>New
&quot;\p{Unicode}&quot; regular expression pattern
property</b> <br>
This is a synonym for &quot;\p{Any}&quot; and matches the
set of Unicode-defined code points 0 &minus; 0x10FFFF.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Better
64&minus;bit support</b> <br>
On 64&minus;bit platforms, the internal array functions now
use 64&minus;bit offsets, allowing Perl arrays to hold more
than 2**31 elements, if you have the memory available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The regular
expression engine now supports strings longer than 2**31
characters. [perl #112790, #116907]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The functions
PerlIO_get_bufsiz, PerlIO_get_cnt, PerlIO_set_cnt and
PerlIO_set_ptrcnt now have SSize_t, rather than int, return
values and parameters.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;use&nbsp;locale&quot;
now works on <small>UTF&minus;8</small> locales</b> <br>
Until this release, only single-byte locales, such as the
<small>ISO 8859</small> series were supported. Now, the
increasingly common multi-byte <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
locales are also supported. A <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
locale is one in which the character set is Unicode and the
encoding is <small>UTF&minus;8.</small> The
<small>POSIX</small> &quot;LC_CTYPE&quot; category
operations (case changing (like &quot;lc()&quot;,
&quot;\U&quot;), and character classification
(&quot;\w&quot;, &quot;\D&quot;,
&quot;qr/[[:punct:]]/&quot;)) under such a locale work just
as if not under locale, but instead as if under
&quot;use&nbsp;feature&nbsp;'unicode_strings'&quot;, except
taint rules are followed. Sorting remains by code point
order in this release. [perl #56820].</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;use&nbsp;locale&quot;
now compiles on systems without locale ability</b> <br>
Previously doing this caused the program to not compile.
Within its scope the program behaves as if in the
&quot;C&quot; locale. Thus programs written for platforms
that support locales can run on locale-less platforms
without change. Attempts to change the locale away from the
&quot;C&quot; locale will, of course, fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>More locale
initialization fallback options</b> <br>
If there was an error with locales during Perl start-up, it
immediately gave up and tried to use the &quot;C&quot;
locale. Now it first tries using other locales given by the
environment variables, as detailed in &quot;
<small>ENVIRONMENT&quot;</small> in perllocale. For example,
if &quot;LC_ALL&quot; and &quot;LANG&quot; are both set, and
using the &quot;LC_ALL&quot; locale fails, Perl will now try
the &quot;LANG&quot; locale, and only if that fails, will it
fall back to &quot;C&quot;. On Windows machines, Perl will
try, ahead of using &quot;C&quot;, the system default locale
if all the locales given by environment variables fail.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;&minus;DL&quot;
runtime option now added for tracing locale setting</b> <br>
This is designed for Perl core developers to aid in field
debugging bugs regarding locales.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;F now
implies &minus;a and &minus;a implies &minus;n</b> <br>
Previously <b>&minus;F</b> without <b>&minus;a</b> was a
no-op, and <b>&minus;a</b> without <b>&minus;n</b> or
<b>&minus;p</b> was a no-op, with this change, if you supply
<b>&minus;F</b> then both <b>&minus;a</b> and
<b>&minus;n</b> are implied and if you supply
<b>&minus;a</b> then <b>&minus;n</b> is implied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can still
use <b>&minus;p</b> for its extra behaviour. [perl
#116190]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>$a and $b
warnings exemption</b> <br>
The special variables $a and $b, used in &quot;sort&quot;,
are now exempt from &quot;used once&quot; warnings, even
where &quot;sort&quot; is not used. This makes it easier for
<small>CPAN</small> modules to provide functions using $a
and $b for similar purposes. [perl #120462]</p>

<h2>Security
<a name="Security"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Avoid
possible read of free()d memory during parsing</b> <br>
It was possible that <b>free()</b>d memory could be read
during parsing in the unusual circumstance of the Perl
program ending with a heredoc and the last line of the file
on disk having no terminating newline character. This has
now been fixed.</p>

<h2>Incompatible Changes
<a name="Incompatible Changes"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;do&quot;
can no longer be used to call subroutines</b> <br>
The &quot;do SUBROUTINE(LIST)&quot; form has resulted in a
deprecation warning since Perl v5.0.0, and is now a syntax
error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Quote-like
escape changes</b> <br>
The character after &quot;\c&quot; in a double-quoted string
(&quot;...&quot; or qq(...)) or regular expression must now
be a printable character and may not be &quot;{&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A literal
&quot;{&quot; after &quot;\B&quot; or &quot;\b&quot; is now
fatal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These were
deprecated in perl v5.14.0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Tainting
happens under more circumstances; now conforms to
documentation</b> <br>
This affects regular expression matching and changing the
case of a string (&quot;lc&quot;, &quot;\U&quot;,
<i>etc</i>.) within the scope of &quot;use locale&quot;. The
result is now tainted based on the operation, no matter what
the contents of the string were, as the documentation
(perlsec, &quot; <small>SECURITY&quot;</small> in
perllocale) indicates it should. Previously, for the case
change operation, if the string contained no characters
whose case change could be affected by the locale, the
result would not be tainted. For example, the result of
&quot;uc()&quot; on an empty string or one containing only
above&minus;Latin1 code points is now tainted, and
wasn&rsquo;t before. This leads to more consistent tainting
results. Regular expression patterns taint their non-binary
results (like $&amp;, $2) if and only if the pattern
contains elements whose matching depends on the current
(potentially tainted) locale. Like the case changing
functions, the actual contents of the string being matched
now do not matter, whereas formerly it did. For example, if
the pattern contains a &quot;\w&quot;, the results will be
tainted even if the match did not have to use that portion
of the pattern to succeed or fail, because what a
&quot;\w&quot; matches depends on locale. However, for
example, a &quot;.&quot; in a pattern will not enable
tainting, because the dot matches any single character, and
what the current locale is doesn&rsquo;t change in any way
what matches and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;\p{}&quot;,
&quot;\P{}&quot; matching has changed for non-Unicode code
points.</b> <br>
&quot;\p{}&quot; and &quot;\P{}&quot; are defined by Unicode
only on Unicode-defined code points (&quot;U+0000&quot;
through &quot;U+10FFFF&quot;). Their behavior on matching
these legal Unicode code points is unchanged, but there are
changes for code points 0x110000 and above. Previously, Perl
treated the result of matching &quot;\p{}&quot; and
&quot;\P{}&quot; against these as &quot;undef&quot;, which
translates into &quot;false&quot;. For &quot;\P{}&quot;,
this was then complemented into &quot;true&quot;. A warning
was supposed to be raised when this happened. However,
various optimizations could prevent the warning, and the
results were often counter-intuitive, with both a match and
its seeming complement being false. Now all non-Unicode code
points are treated as typical unassigned Unicode code
points. This generally is more Do-What-I-Mean. A warning is
raised only if the results are arguably different from a
strict Unicode approach, and from what Perl used to do. Code
that needs to be strictly Unicode compliant can make this
warning fatal, and then Perl always raises the warning.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Details are in
&quot;Beyond Unicode code points&quot; in perlunicode.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&quot;\p{All}&quot;
has been expanded to match all possible code points</b> <br>
The Perl-defined regular expression pattern element
&quot;\p{All}&quot;, unused on <small>CPAN,</small> used to
match just the Unicode code points; now it matches all
possible code points; that is, it is equivalent to
&quot;qr/./s&quot;. Thus &quot;\p{All}&quot; is no longer
synonymous with &quot;\p{Any}&quot;, which continues to
match just the Unicode code points, as Unicode says it
should.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Data::Dumper&rsquo;s
output may change</b> <br>
Depending on the data structures dumped and the settings set
for Data::Dumper, the dumped output may have changed from
previous versions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
tests that depend on the exact output of Data::Dumper, they
may fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid this
problem in your code, test against the data structure from
evaluating the dumped structure, instead of the dump
itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Locale
decimal point character no longer leaks outside of
&quot;use&nbsp;locale&quot; scope</b> <br>
This is actually a bug fix, but some code has come to rely
on the bug being present, so this change is listed here. The
current locale that the program is running under is not
supposed to be visible to Perl code except within the scope
of a &quot;use&nbsp;locale&quot;. However, until now under
certain circumstances, the character used for a decimal
point (often a comma) leaked outside the scope. If your code
is affected by this change, simply add a
&quot;use&nbsp;locale&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Assignments
of Windows sockets error codes to $! now prefer</b>
<i>errno.h</i> <b>values over WSAGetLastError() values</b>
<br>
In previous versions of Perl, Windows sockets error codes as
returned by <b>WSAGetLastError()</b> were assigned to $!,
and some constants such as <small>ECONNABORTED,</small> not
in <i>errno.h</i> in <small>VC++</small> (or the various
Windows ports of gcc) were defined to corresponding WSAE*
values to allow $! to be tested against the E* constants
exported by Errno and <small>POSIX</small> .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This worked
well until <small>VC++ 2010</small> and later, which
introduced new E* constants with values &gt; 100 into
<i>errno.h</i>, including some being (re)defined by perl to
WSAE* values. That caused problems when linking
<small>XS</small> code against other libraries which used
the original definitions of <i>errno.h</i> constants.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid this
incompatibility, perl now maps WSAE* error codes to E*
values where possible, and assigns those values to $!. The
E* constants exported by Errno and <small>POSIX</small> are
updated to match so that testing $! against them, wherever
previously possible, will continue to work as expected, and
all E* constants found in <i>errno.h</i> are now exported
from those modules with their original <i>errno.h</i>
values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
avoid breakage in existing Perl code which assigns WSAE*
values to $!, perl now intercepts the assignment and
performs the same mapping to E* values as it uses internally
when assigning to $! itself.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, one
backwards-incompatibility remains: existing Perl code which
compares $! against the numeric values of the WSAE* error
codes that were previously assigned to $! will now be broken
in those cases where a corresponding E* value has been
assigned instead. This is only an issue for those E* values
&lt; 100, which were always exported from Errno and
<small>POSIX</small> with their original <i>errno.h</i>
values, and therefore could not be used for WSAE* error code
tests (e.g. <small>WSAEINVAL</small> is 10022, but the
corresponding <small>EINVAL</small> is 22). (E* values &gt;
100, if present, were redefined to WSAE* values anyway, so
compatibility can be achieved by using the E* constants,
which will work both before and after this change, albeit
using different numeric values under the hood.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Functions
&quot;PerlIO_vsprintf&quot; and &quot;PerlIO_sprintf&quot;
have been removed</b> <br>
These two functions, undocumented, unused in
<small>CPAN,</small> and problematic, have been removed.</p>

<h2>Deprecations
<a name="Deprecations"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>The
&quot;/\C/&quot; character class</b> <br>
The &quot;/\C/&quot; regular expression character class is
deprecated. From perl 5.22 onwards it will generate a
warning, and from perl 5.24 onwards it will be a regular
expression compiler error. If you need to examine the
individual bytes that make up a UTF8&minus;encoded
character, then use &quot;utf8::encode()&quot; on the string
(or a copy) first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Literal
control characters in variable names</b> <br>
This deprecation affects things like $\cT, where \cT is a
literal control (such as a &quot;NAK&quot; or &quot;NEGATIVE
ACKNOWLEDGE&quot; character) in the source code.
Surprisingly, it appears that originally this was intended
as the canonical way of accessing variables like $^T, with
the caret form only being added as an alternative.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The literal
control form is being deprecated for two main reasons. It
has what are likely unfixable bugs, such as $\cI not working
as an alias for $^I, and their usage not being portable to
non-ASCII platforms: While $^T will work everywhere, \cT is
whitespace in <small>EBCDIC.</small> [perl #119123]</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>References
to non-integers and non-positive integers in $/</b> <br>
Setting $/ to a reference to zero or a reference to a
negative integer is now deprecated, and will behave
<b>exactly</b> as though it was set to &quot;undef&quot;. If
you want slurp behavior set $/ to &quot;undef&quot;
explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Setting $/ to a
reference to a non integer is now forbidden and will throw
an error. Perl has never documented what would happen in
this context and while it used to behave the same as setting
$/ to the address of the references in future it may behave
differently, so we have forbidden this usage.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Character
matching routines in <small>POSIX</small></b> <br>
Use of any of these functions in the &quot;POSIX&quot;
module is now deprecated: &quot;isalnum&quot;,
&quot;isalpha&quot;, &quot;iscntrl&quot;,
&quot;isdigit&quot;, &quot;isgraph&quot;,
&quot;islower&quot;, &quot;isprint&quot;,
&quot;ispunct&quot;, &quot;isspace&quot;,
&quot;isupper&quot;, and &quot;isxdigit&quot;. The functions
are buggy and don&rsquo;t work on <small>UTF&minus;8</small>
encoded strings. See their entries in <small>POSIX</small>
for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A warning is
raised on the first call to any of them from each place in
the code that they are called. (Hence a repeated statement
in a loop will raise just the one warning.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Interpreter-based
threads are now</b> <i>discouraged</i> <br>
The &quot;interpreter-based threads&quot; provided by Perl
are not the fast, lightweight system for multitasking that
one might expect or hope for. Threads are implemented in a
way that make them easy to misuse. Few people know how to
use them correctly or will be able to provide help.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The use of
interpreter-based threads in perl is officially
discouraged.</p>

removals</b> <br>
The following modules will be removed from the core
distribution in a future release, and will at that time need

achieved by preallocating the hash&rsquo;s internal iterator
state, rather than lazily creating it when the hash is first
iterated. (For small hashes, the iterator is still created
only when first needed. The assumption is that small hashes
are more likely to be used as objects, and therefore never
allocated. For large hashes, that&rsquo;s less likely to be
true, and the cost of allocating the iterator is swamped by
the cost of allocating space for the hash itself.)</p></td></tr>

There is a possible problem with the mixing of a control
flow operator (e.g. &quot;return&quot;) and a low-precedence
operator like &quot;or&quot;. Consider:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sub { return $a
or $b; }</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This is parsed

parentheses or the high-precedence variant of the

initialized locale handling to the system default, just in
case the program being executed ends up using locales. (This
is one of the first things a locale-aware program should do,
long before Perl knows if it will actually be needed or
not.) This works well except when Perl is embedded in
another application which wants a locale that isn&rsquo;t
the system default. Now, if the environment variable
&quot;PERL_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT&quot; is set at the time Perl is
started, this initialization step is skipped. Prior to this,
on Windows platforms, the only workaround for this
deficiency was to use a hacked-up copy of internal Perl
code. Applications that need to use older Perls can discover
if the embedded Perl they are using needs the workaround by
testing that the C preprocessor symbol
&quot;HAS_SKIP_LOCALE_INIT&quot; is not defined. [

<h2>Obituary
<a name="Obituary"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Diana Rosa, 27,
of Rio de Janeiro, went to her long rest on May 10, 2014,
along with the plush camel she kept hanging on her computer
screen all the time. She was a passionate Perl hacker who
loved the language and its community, and who never missed a
Rio.pm event. She was a true artist, an enthusiast about
writing code, singing arias and graffiting walls.
We&rsquo;ll never forget you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Greg McCarroll
died on August 28, 2013.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Greg was well
known for many good reasons. He was one of the organisers of
the first YAPC::Europe, which concluded with an unscheduled
auction where he frantically tried to raise extra money to
avoid the conference making a loss. It was Greg who
mistakenly arrived for a london.pm meeting a week late; some
years later he was the one who sold the choice of official
meeting date at a YAPC::Europe auction, and eventually as
glorious leader of london.pm he got to inherit the
irreverent confusion that he had created.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Always helpful,
friendly and cheerfully optimistic, you will be missed, but
never forgotten.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you find
what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the
perl bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may
also be information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home
Page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you believe
you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug program
included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to
a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with
the output of &quot;perl &minus;V&quot;, will be sent off to
perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting
team.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the bug you
are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list,
then please send it to
perl5&minus;security&minus;report@perl.org. This points to a
closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able to help assess the
impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the
problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
