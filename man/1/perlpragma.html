&minus; how to write a user pragma</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A pragma is a
module which influences some aspect of the compile time or
run time behaviour of Perl, such as &quot;strict&quot; or
&quot;warnings&quot;. With Perl 5.10 you are no longer
limited to the built in pragmata; you can now create user
pragmata that modify the behaviour of user functions within
a lexical scope.</p>

<h2>A basic example
<a name="A basic example"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
say you need to create a class implementing overloaded
mathematical operators, and would like to provide your own
pragma that functions much like &quot;use integer;&quot;
You&rsquo;d like this code</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">use MyMaths;
<br>
my $l = MyMaths&minus;&gt;new(1.2); <br>
my $r = MyMaths&minus;&gt;new(3.4); <br>
print &quot;A: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;; <br>
use myint; <br>
print &quot;B: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;; <br>
{ <br>
no myint; <br>
print &quot;C: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;; <br>
} <br>
print &quot;D: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;; <br>
no myint; <br>
print &quot;E: &quot;, $l + $r, &quot;\n&quot;;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">to give the
output</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A: 4.6 <br>
B: 4 <br>
C: 4.6 <br>
D: 4 <br>
E: 4.6</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>i.e.</i>,
where &quot;use myint;&quot; is in effect, addition
operations are forced to integer, whereas by default they
are not, with the default behaviour being restored via
&quot;no myint;&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The minimal
implementation of the package &quot;MyMaths&quot; would be
something like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package
MyMaths; <br>
use v5.36; <br>
use myint(); <br>
use overload '+' =&gt; sub { <br>
my ($l, $r) = @_; <br>
# Pass 1 to check up one call level from here <br>
if (myint::in_effect(1)) { <br>
int($$l) + int($$r); <br>
} else { <br>
$$l + $$r; <br>
} <br>
}; <br>
sub new { <br>
my ($class, $value) = @_; <br>
bless \$value, $class; <br>
} <br>
1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note how we
load the user pragma &quot;myint&quot; with an empty list
&quot;()&quot; to prevent its &quot;import&quot; being
called.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The interaction
with the Perl compilation happens inside package
&quot;myint&quot;:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">package myint;
<br>
use v5.36; <br>
sub import { <br>
$^H{&quot;myint/in_effect&quot;} = 1; <br>
} <br>
sub unimport { <br>
$^H{&quot;myint/in_effect&quot;} = 0; <br>
} <br>
sub in_effect { <br>
my $level = shift // 0; <br>
my $hinthash = (caller($level))[10]; <br>
return $hinthash&minus;&gt;{&quot;myint/in_effect&quot;};
<br>
} <br>
1;</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As pragmata are
implemented as modules, like any other module, &quot;use
myint;&quot; becomes</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { <br>
require myint; <br>
myint&minus;&gt;import(); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">and &quot;no
myint;&quot; is</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">BEGIN { <br>
require myint; <br>
myint&minus;&gt;unimport(); <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hence the
&quot;import&quot; and &quot;unimport&quot; routines are
called at <b>compile time</b> for the user&rsquo;s code.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">User pragmata
store their state by writing to the magical hash
&quot;%^H&quot;, hence these two routines manipulate it. The
state information in &quot;%^H&quot; is stored in the
optree, and can be retrieved read-only at runtime with
&quot;caller()&quot;, at index 10 of the list of returned
results. In the example pragma, retrieval is encapsulated
into the routine &quot;in_effect()&quot;, which takes as
parameter the number of call frames to go up to find the
value of the pragma in the user&rsquo;s script. This uses
&quot;caller()&quot; to determine the value of
$^H{&quot;myint/in_effect&quot;} when each line of the
user&rsquo;s script was called, and therefore provide the
correct semantics in the subroutine implementing the
overloaded addition.</p>

<h2>Key naming
<a name="Key naming"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is only a
single &quot;%^H&quot;, but arbitrarily many modules that
want to use its scoping semantics. To avoid stepping on each
other&rsquo;s toes, they need to be sure to use different
keys in the hash. It is therefore conventional for a module
to use only keys that begin with the module&rsquo;s name
(the name of its main package) and a &quot;/&quot;
character. After this module-identifying prefix, the rest of
the key is entirely up to the module: it may include any
characters whatsoever. For example, a module
&quot;Foo::Bar&quot; should use keys such as
&quot;Foo::Bar/baz&quot; and &quot;Foo::Bar/$%/_!&quot;.
Modules following this convention all play nicely with each
other.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl core
uses a handful of keys in &quot;%^H&quot; which do not
follow this convention, because they predate it. Keys that
follow the convention won&rsquo;t conflict with the
core&rsquo;s historical keys.</p>

<h2>Implementation details
<a name="Implementation details"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The optree is
shared between threads. This means there is a possibility
that the optree will outlive the particular thread (and
therefore the interpreter instance) that created it, so true
Perl scalars cannot be stored in the optree. Instead a
compact form is used, which can only store values that are
integers (signed and unsigned), strings or &quot;undef&quot;
&minus; references and floating point values are
stringified. If you need to store multiple values or complex
structures, you should serialise them, for example with
&quot;pack&quot;. The deletion of a hash key from
&quot;%^H&quot; is recorded, and as ever can be
distinguished from the existence of a key with value
&quot;undef&quot; with &quot;exists&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Don&rsquo;t</b>
attempt to store references to data structures as integers
which are retrieved via &quot;caller&quot; and converted
back, as this will not be threadsafe. Accesses would be to
the structure without locking (which is not safe for
Perl&rsquo;s scalars), and either the structure has to leak,
or it has to be freed when its creating thread terminates,
which may be before the optree referencing it is deleted, if
other threads outlive it.</p>
